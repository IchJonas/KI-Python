274;'I produced an error last week about CHORION:   I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek Lexicon renders each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed chorion.   Now I\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:  \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Louw and Nida \tRobinson\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Grimm \tWord study Concordance, Tynsdale \tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  \t early Christian Writings, Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon, Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:  \tA space, place, region, district, field, area, country place,  \tland, farm, estate, a bit of tillage, and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about grave. As some of these  books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer\'s investigations into contradictions to  be once again, as your friend said it, lacking in substance, and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them to support Mr Archer\'s contentions).   By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\'s) is the definition of agros, the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word agros is defined as a field in the country. Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for field in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for field in Acts (ie: chorion), and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the Potter\'s Field.   \t\t\t\tLater,  \t\t\t\tDave Butler';3

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of 2001: A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\'s a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only    5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    2.00 quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used    for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     That\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action, not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\'t think it\'s    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    preferred playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also    improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for double size scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\'m not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.

992;'Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn\'t have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can\'t store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It\'s not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.  Thanks.';1

67;' And that, of course, is the point.   You can\'t simply divide the world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.  If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion.  But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone\'s suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you  are - I assume - worried about.  And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical, critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and easily led on the other.  I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief  in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point.';0

1126;' Yeah, and it\'s also true most long complicated sequences of events, calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don\'t argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I just question whether you >should<.  The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we can\'t model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don\'t think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.  I guess I just haven\'t seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I really hope I do, but I\'m not holding my self-similar breath.   Uh huh.  I\'ll believe it when I see it.  I\'ve been chasing fractal compression for a few years, and I still don\'t believe in it.  If it\'s so great, how come we don\'t see it competing with JPEG?  \'Cause it can\'t, I\'ll wager.  Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I don\'t think it\'s a reasonable alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)  I\'ll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That\'s why I don\'t think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical.

I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book Mormon Doctrine is oftentimes referred to as McConkie\'s Bible in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\'s books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

The argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands of people.  Look at L. Ron Hubbard.  Now, he was probably not all there, but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology.  I think the  Baker\'s and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time, but look at the number of follower they have.  As for lunatics, the best example is Hitler.  He was obviously insane, his advisors certainly thought so.  Yet he had a whole country entralled and came close to ruling all of Europe.  How many Germans gave their lives for him?  To this day he has his followers.  I\'m just amazed that people still try to use this argument.  It\'s just so obviously *wrong*.                ';0
405;'I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans. I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.  eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist      from the sun and the suns temperature..)    Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance    Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much      can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect      atmosphere.  I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the      earth.  I suppose density should be important as well.  Climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc.  Just the above three factors and how they relate to one another.  Jonathan --';2

Worden,                      The Deputy for Technology, SDIO                                                        Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach                               April 3,1993       Most of you, as am I, are children of the 1960\'s.  We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were miracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - you\'ve lost it!  The me generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle - to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened to your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more before putting the first rubber on the road.  Max Hunter - you didn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn V\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at hand!';2

Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as  we know it. LF suggests that God doesn\'t want that and has sent Koresh  as a reminder.   Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don\'t  have a good idea yet what being shielded by the seals actually involves  or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical well versed.) \t\t\t     - < > -  Me personally, I\'m totally 100\% dependent on God through Christ, so  if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants to save me, or dispose of me, that\'s great either way.

981;'Tony-  I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other typicalChristian anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may be unaware of all the statistica findings concerning African-Americans that have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances, but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case. Fortunately African-Americans had whites who supported their \'cause\' and public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty much legal to discriminate against them.  I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something, that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society, including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\'s great commandment to Love, and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes in the commandment of Love (though I\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and treated as runaway slaves for being nigger-lovers and such.  I guess I\'ve decided the challenge is worth it.  In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\'t know of one case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.  I\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0 raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more oppressive legisation against gays.  Perhaps you don\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\'t get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God\'s will be done as they massacred thousands in witch hunts and inquisitions.  The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\'t change the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a conditional love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\'ll love you. This is sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an unconditional love, one that calls people just as they are.  Sure there are things that will \'naturally\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people\'s expectations. In the process this coerced conformity causes many people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their own sense of pseuper-spirituality.  This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with something very personal like \'sexuality\' (a taboo subject even today), but I firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation on thier bedrooms.  It\'s funny that most straight people have successfully removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation, but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society. Gay people are not criminals.  Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\'s pastors arrested for self- admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends recently told me he was approached by someone who is going through the reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.  These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in Colorado has created an organization who\'s posters are appearing all over Colorado called S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T. (I forget the whole definition off hand, but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto is Working for a fag-free America with an implicit advocation for violence.  This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are embracing.  We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don\'t \'measure up\', and constant beratement from organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of excluding people.  The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to include people.  I have several of Dr. Martin\'s books and find them quite helpful, especially concerning \'cults.\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto itself.  Why don\'t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?  Whatever';3

At present only DOS and UNIX environment is being worked on and it our hope that we can generate enough interest where all the major platform can be accomodated via a plaform independent API/TOOLKIT/SDK We are of the mind that it is about time that such project and group be form to deal with these issues. We want to setup a repository where these files may be access such as Simte20 and start putting together a OTG FAQ. If you have some or any information that in your opinion would be  of interest to the OTG community and you like to see included in our first FAQ please send it email to the address below.

929;': : 42 is 101010 binary, and who would forget that its the : : answer to the Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything else. : : Of course the Question has not yet been discovered... : ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ : But it WAS discovered (sort of).  The question was What is 7 times 8?  [ Read on and there\'s a special prize at the bottom.  Amaze your friends and gain respect from your peers that you can carry on so long about the number 42. ]  The original question was What is the meaning of Life, the Universe, and and Everything.  The answer generated by Deep Thought (the 2nd largest computer ever created) was 42.  Deep Thought realized that to understand the answer, one must really know what the question is.  Unfortunately, he didn\'t.  But he was able to help build the largest computer (named Earth) which could figure out the real question.  (I know this is background knowledge for everyone here... just bear with me a sec... :)  When Arthur pulled the scrabble tiles out of the bag, he spelled out What is nine times six? (or the like).  However, it is not clear that the monkey-man had the right question in his brain, especially since it was that lady in the diner (which was vaporized moments later) that came up with the answer to how everyone could get along.  On the other hand, Marvin said he saw the answer in Dent\'s brain, so lets presume it\'s  correct.  Well, NINE TIMES SIX ***IS*** FORTY-TWO!!!  ...in base 13.  Chew on that for awhile... :)  -- Chris Russell            Custom software, networks, CASE tools, and consulting Adaptive Solutions       Sun SPARC, SGI IRIS, HP Apollo, Macintosh, & PC';1
157;'  \tThe R Us is not trademarked, but the Backwards R Us is, I  believe.    ---    Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a   term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, God must exist, because   he wouldn\'t be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really   doesn\'t!  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological   proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among   others?';0
1703;' Craig-  I thought it was derived from a Greek acronym.  My Greek isn\'t up to much, but it goes something like this:  \tJesus Christ, God => Iesus CHristos, THeos => Ichthos  which is the Greek for fish (as in, eg ichthysaurus).  Apologies for my dreadful Greek!  Perhaps someone will correct it.  By the way, what does your sig mean?';0

128;' Well, I\'ll avoid your question for now (got some learnin\' to do) with a promise to come back with more info when I can find it.  I _do_ know that BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of long-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge of the all-sky map\'s accuracy.  PR material for the other three instruments give accuracies on the order of fractions of a degree, if that\'s  any help.  Speaking of GRO, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps for orbit adjust appear to be going well.  Our branch guy who\'s helping out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the burns will take place in mid-June.  Anyway, I\'m off to find out more.  \'Be back when I get some info.';2
447;'Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   I\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\'ve      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some Creator      was behind the universe\'s existence.  I\'ve      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, I\'ve known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and I\'ve even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      they\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher      being.  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      truth of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Qur\'an, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      ture\'s truth is to damn one\'s soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its truth      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesn\'t stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the right readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with mystery.      Circular arguments, self-evdent facts and      truths, unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions he\'s been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with mythical gods (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of God\'s existence and question it impartially?

I\'ve also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 (from memory as well).  As far as the low-level stuff goes, it looks pretty nice.

1212;' Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme (LZW?).  IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga. It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga. The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.  Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats (Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)';1

663;'molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.   While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing.   This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video recording equipment.   Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological            sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art            computer graphics into their research- computer scientists            wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of            scientific visualization.

I also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16 packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black, 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.

The Christian Bible says that one may kill #under certain circumstances.   In fact, it instructs one to kill under #certain circumstances.       I\'d say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them to kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between motivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism \'allows\' atoricities, then that\'s an indictment of that theism.  But it rather depends on what the \'certain circumstances\' are.  When you talk about Christianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood. It\'s when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls apart.

That was religously motivated. # #What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic  #labourers?     That *wasn\'t* religiously motivated?  Not in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don\'t do this (nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it\'s just too broad too say religion did this.  I\'m saying that the causes are far more complex than that - take away the religious element, and you\'d still have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say \'stop the  killing\', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not to read minds. # # #|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions, #|> and the many religous wars. # #What\'s so special about these exceptions?    Isn\'t this all just a #grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders #to be religiously motivated?    What\'s the general principle behind #all this?  The general principle is that it\'s fairly clear (to me, at least) that religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It\'s not nearly so obvious what\'s going on when one looks at NI, apart from violence of course. # #|> #It\'s not an abstract argument.

You read minds, and I don\'t.  You\'ve speculated on my motives often enough, and you don\'t take my statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim  not to read minds has no credibility with me, sorry.   I also note that  you fail to answer my question.  It just looks to me very much like you have an axe to grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what  most Protestants say - which is @stop the killing.  The people you refer to are properly described as Unionists, not Protestants. # #As for their position of privilege, what is that if not religion- #based?  It is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism.  None of these things are synonymous with religion, though there is certainly some overlap.  ';0

It\'s somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I\'ve seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory.';0

Contact:   Lee Moore -- Webster Research Center, Xerox Corp. --   Voice: +1 (716) 422 2496   Arpa, Internet:  Moore.Wbst128@Xerox.Com [ Check also on ncgia.ucsb.edu (128.111.254.105), /pub/dems -- nfotis ]    Many of these files are also available on CD-ROM selled by USGS:   1:2,000,000 scale  Digital Line Graph (DLG) Data. Contains datas   for all 50 states. Price is about $28, call to or visit in offices   in Menlo Park, in Reston, Virginia (800-USA-MAPS).    The Data User Services Division of the Bureau of the Census also has   data on CD-ROM (TSO standard format) that is derived from USGS   1:100,000 map data. Call (301) 763-4100 for more info or they have   a BBS at (301) 763-1568.  [ From Dr.Dobbs #198 March 1993: ]        The U.S. Defense Mapping Agency, in cooperation with their counterpart agencies in CANADA, the U.K., and Australia, have released the Digital Chart of the World (DCW). This chart consists of over 1.5 gigabytes of reasonable quality vector data distributed on four CD-ROMS. .... includes coastlines, rivers, roads, railrays, airports,cities, towns, spot elevations, and depths, and over 100,000 place names.  It is ISO9660 compatible and only $200.00 available from:  U.S. Geological Survey P.O.

Bourke).   Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail   archive servers. Check with Archie.  Commercial:    Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price   is about $100. Their address is: \tVRL \t2341 Ganador court \tSan Luis Obispo, \tCA 93401 \tTelephone or FAX (805) 545-8515    Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.   Check with: \tNatural Graphics \tP.O. Box 1963 \tRaklin, CA 95677 \tPhone (916) 624-1436    Don\'t forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.    Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.   CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency\'s ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There\'s another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you\'ll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 public domain tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,   etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following   address for more info:       National Space Science Date Center      Goddard Space Flight Center      Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      Telephone: (301) 286-6695      Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov    The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.   Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log   in as \'NODIS\' (no password).    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,   no parity, one stop). At the Enter Number: prompt, enter MD and   carriage return. When the system responds Call Complete, enter a few   more carriage returns to get the Username: and log in as \'NODIS\' (no   password).    NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of   what\'s there is available at present.  Earth Sciences Data -------------------    There\'s a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including   imagery. This listing is called Earth Sciences Resources on Internet,   and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]   in the directory COGS under the name internet.resources.earth.sci    Some sites include:   aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images   ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from         Magellan and Viking missions etc.         pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole         archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There\'s also an         e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter         to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the         subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:          send SPACE Index         send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91          (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the         email server at present)    vab02.larc.nasa.gov [128.155.23.47]: pub/gifs/misc/landsat - \tLandsat photos in GIF and JPEG format [ It was shut down - nfotis- anyone has a copy of this archive?? ]  Others ------   Daily values of river discharge, streamflow, and daily weather data is   available from EarthInfo, 5541 Central Ave., Boulder CO  80301.  These   disks are expensive, around $500, but there are quantity discounts.   (303) 938-1788.    Check vmd.cso.uiuc.edu [128.174.5.98], the wx directory carries   data regarding surface analysis, weather radar, and sat view pics in   GIF format (updated hourly)    pioneer.unm.edu [129.24.9.217] is the Space and Planetary Image Facility   (located on the University of New Mexico campus) FTP server. It provides   Anonymous FTP access to >150 CD-ROMS  with data/images.    A disk with earthquake data, topography, gravity, geopolitical info   is available from NGDC (National Geophysical Data Center), 325 Broadway,   Boulder, CO  80303.  (303) 497-6958.    EOSAT (at least in the US) now sells Landsat MSS data older than two years   old for $200 per scene, and they have been talking about a similar deal   for Landsat TM data. The MSS data are 4 bands, 80 meter resolution.    Check out anonymous FTP to ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in   UNIX/PolyView/alpha-shape for a tool that creates convex hulls   alpha-shapes (a generalization of the convex hull) from 3D point sets.

Code for viewing ADRG (Arc Digitised Raster Graphics) files is   available on the GRIPS II CD-ROM. The U.S. Army Engineer    Topographic Labs (Juan Perez) code is also available via FTP   ( adrg.zip archive in  spectrum.xerox.com )  NRCC range data ---------------   Rioux M., Cournoyer L. The NRCC Three-Dimensional Image Data Files,   Tech. Report, CNRC 29077, National Research Council Canada,   Ottawa, Canada, 1988   [ From what I understand, these data are from a laser range finder,    and you can a copy for research purposes ]  ==========================================================================  12. 3D scanners - Digitized 3D Data ===================================  a. Cyberware Labs, Monterey, CA, manufactures a 3D color laser digitizer   which can be used to model parts of, or a complete, human body.   They run a service bureau also, so they can digitize models for you.    Address:     Cyberware Labs, Inc     8 Harris Ct, Suite 3D     Monterey, CA 93940   Phone: (408)373-1441, Fax: (408)373-3582  b. Polhemus makes a 6D input device (actually a couple of models)   that senses position (3D) and *orientation* (+3D) based on electromagnetic   field interference.  This equipment is also incorporated in the   VPL Dataglove.   This hardware is also called ISOTRACK, from Keiser Aerospace.  Ascension Technology makes a similar 3D input device. There is a company, Applied Sciences(?), that makes a 3D input device (position only) based on speed of sound triangulation.  c. A company that specializes in digitizing is Viewpoint. You can ask    for Viewpoint\'s _free_ 100 page catalog full of ready to     ship datasets from categories such as cars, anatomy, aircraft,sports,    boats, trains, animals and others. Though these objects are    quite expensive, the cataloge is nevertheless of interest for it    has pictures of all the available objects in wireframe , polygon mesh.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson\'s. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don\'t have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there\'s a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is: \tEdition Belvedere Co. Ltd., \t00196 Rome Italy, \tPiazzale Flaminio, 19 \tTel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can\'t be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There\'s a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: An Introduction to Ray Tracing, in   Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD, ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  Displays on Display column of IEEE CG&A Jan \'87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell\'s teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep \'87 in Jim Blinn\'s column Jim Blinn\'s Corner describes an another way to model the teapot- Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you\'re advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here\'s a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles\' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model\'s distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn\'t normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford\'s InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I\'m not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. \'ice\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\'s a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it\'s an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17. Scientific visualization stuff ==================================  X Data Slice (xds) -------------------   Bundled with the X11 distribution from MIT,   in the contrib directory. Available at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu [141.142.20.50]   (either as a source or binaries for various platforms).

For other information contact Doug Norton (e-mail: 74017.461@@compuserve.com)   IRIS Explorer -------------   It\'s an application creation system developed by Silicon   Graphics that provides visualisation and analysis functionality for   computational scientists, engineers and other scientists. The Explorer   GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write   any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can   be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently   is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on   other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as   I know]    See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.    There are also two FTP servers for related stuff, modules etc.:    ftp.epcc.ed.ac.uk [129.215.56.29]   swedishchef.lerc.nasa.gov [139.88.54.33] - mirror of the UK site  apE ---   Back in the \'old good days\', you could get apE for nearly free.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\'m not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\'ve   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\'s a   freebie if you want it    My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\'s mostly astronomical   image processing which I\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)   [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and  for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

The system can be distri-  buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-  tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video  animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to  produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from  visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,  and  image  processing  operations.

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called GVLware.  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it\'s public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software. A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.    This location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software, as   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.   This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   tar archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,   John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review   it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu    Support    Listserv mailing lists:    grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users- application-level   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers- system-level   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation   of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.    Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of   the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in   Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the   community- while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass   through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send   E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.  Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The PCI software consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI   database disk file.  The Tape I/O package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the PCI database file-   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5), and   God only knows what all else -- there\'s a LOT.  I don\'t have and don\'t   use these, so can\'t say much about them- you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters, read from   a common parameter file which must be (in VMS anyway) in your default   directory.  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\'s   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls raw) data from tape, in a number of different   interleave orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry\'s CT2T format, would probably (I haven\'t tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It\'s worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to   contain not only raster (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass- all of this   can go into the PCI database).    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be overkill   in your case- it seems designed for the very high end   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\'t suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\'s   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing- I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands)- a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\'re interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

187;'I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in  Graphics Gems I doesn\'t work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.  I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution of linear equations).  To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say, P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the normalized vector from P1 to P2. These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points (for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which will require bringing in another routine I don\'t have (but should be easy to find).  Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual, ASC G&C 2102,  \tDuring the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is \tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower \tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) \torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a \tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other \tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort \tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of \tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining \tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target \tin second stage.      This really is a good answer, but it\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\'ll try     to interpret.      1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack \tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the \trelative wind) and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line \tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly \tnegative angle (a negative q-alpha).\tThis causes a little bit of \tdownward force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z \tdirection) and this force alleviates structural loading. \tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\'re about the \tmost delicate part of the vehicle.      3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more \tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or \tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be \tthe case if we didn\'t roll (performance gain).      4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated \tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort \tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (decreased abort maneuver \tcomplexity).      5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio \tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio \tantennae on the Orbiter (improved S-band look angles).      6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a \thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is \tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east \t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity \tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: \tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. \tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its \tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, Why isn\'t the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the top     [Orbiter side] and the bottom [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\'s.  (A side note: the     Saturn V\'s also had a roll program.  Don\'t ask me why -- I\'m a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the roll     maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.     The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion, a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you can\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     It\'s worth asking if yours doesn\'t.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would stop doubting and believe (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That\'s no mystery either.  The world hates him without reason.  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.';3

One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME\'s, you don\'t have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization burn(s).  On-orbit, SSME\'s are just dead weight, since we don\'t have an SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means that you can\'t use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.  Throw-away SSME\'s might let us use some of the old SSME\'s which are not- quite-man-ratable.

1289;'In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words  translated into the word hell.  These Greek words have totally different  meanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.      In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the  New Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol... meaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be  likened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)      Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.        Why?  Because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the  traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never  remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!      In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of  the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of  shadowy realm.  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to  this hell.      The second hell of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in  scripture, 2 Pet.2:4- For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast  them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be  reserved unto judgment...      Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14-  Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels  (now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to  Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the  mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6- 1 Cor.6:3).      Tartaros, then, is a hell that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or demons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe  the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible  is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell.      The the third word that is translated as hell in the Bible is Gehenna. It comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning valley of Hinniom.  Hinnom is a  deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.      In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including  infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made  their children pass through the fire to the god Molech.  The rites were  specifically celebrated in Tophet, the place of abhorrence, one of the chief  groves in the valley).      King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He  defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later  the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem- a repository for  sewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were  also burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding  by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.      Aceldama, the field of blood, purchased with the money Judas received for the betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.      So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?        In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working  religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the  re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming. Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: And the beast was taken, and with  him the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire  burning with brimstone.          Where will this temporary lake of fire (this hell) be?      The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: For  Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is  prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood,  the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it (Isa.30:33).      One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled  fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).      But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible  say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of  fire?      In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be  thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will  become of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity?        The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna  fire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This  punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the  second death (Rev.20:14- 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a  further resurrection.      The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.                                 The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. For, behold, the day  cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do  wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up... (4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be ashes under the  soles of your feet...(Mal.4:3).      Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living  torture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or  valley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left,  but ashes!       Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means  complete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The  Bible says, in Romans 6:23, The wages of sin is death, not eternal life in  torture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of  life. ';3

They could have beaten us if either:  * Their rocket hadn\'t blown up on the pad thus setting them back,  and/or  * A Saturn V went boom.  If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would have concentrated on the moon. ';2

When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.   Interestingly, there are those who say that existence exists is one of the indubitable statements possible.

1656;'   Yes, I do.      My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is it\'s primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing   innocents, is unconscionable.    At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn\'t clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?

916;'LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics                 Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists            CLAIM to be looking for a Unified Field Theory in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the Reciprocal System, is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time:                      (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.                      (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called UNIT VELOCITY and THE NATURAL            DATUM).                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the            organization that was started to promote Larson\'s Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal RECIPROCITY.                         Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larson\'s lack of a fancy PH.D. degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers\' experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a unified field theory that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      Modern physics does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\'s books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that epicycles, crystal spheres,            geocentricity, flat earth theory, etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\'s Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larson\'s organization, THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE, and Editor of            their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY.  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   Super Collider BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the Superconducting Super            Collider, in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of scientific            value.                      Most physicists don\'t realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (mesons, hyperons, ALLEGED quarks, etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Don\'t we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the Supercollider?!                                 Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum.                       In Larson\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larson\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help prove Einstein\'s General Theory of Relativity.                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than General Relativity can, by            INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity.  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of Special            Relativity, including the parts about mass increases near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE- but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term COORDINATE TIME when writing            about this.]                            In regard to mass increases, it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\'s Theory,            mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called Big Bang (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION, by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the 3-degree background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theory\'s success:            In his first book in 1959, THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE, Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\'s            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the Cosmic Sector.  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by fusion.  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\'s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present- and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter, neutron            stars, black holes, etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bode\'s Law.                         Black Hole FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO black            holes merging together into a SINGLE black hole, and            concluded that the new black hole would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original black holes.                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of black            holes, etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\'s books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, it is            clear to me that black holes are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the black            hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to prove their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\'s severe physical            problem somehow makes him wiser.  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\'s            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFO\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER, by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one paragraph:                      As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larson\'s book NOTHING BUT            MOTION] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.                            Note that in Larson\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the unit frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the unit rate).             (Unit velocity is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larson\'s Theory.)  [I might have the above and            below labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larson\'s Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the unit frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            science (or physics, or astronomy, etc.), as well as            the scientific literature and the education systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\'s Theory has they have.                      Larson\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larson\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larson\'s Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

It violates free will, Hudson.    (me)  /(hudson) /Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?  Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES NOT) define only right and wrong.  It also defines acceptable social behavior, without any overtones of good and evil.  Picking up your trash is not really a right/wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good and Evil.  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social behavior.    Your definition of the word morality is what is causing you to trip over  yourself here.     /(me) /And since />I, selfish being that I am, want to maximize my gains from society, I will />not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down />on how much benefit I can derive from society.  /(hudson) /Why is your benefit somehow related to morality.  Again, your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot.      /(hudson) /What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced /more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society? /Maybe something might hurt society, but it would help him immensly?  That is irrational thinking.    There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic  destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it.   Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they have doesn\'t prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes  with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you want to interfere in people\'s lives even when they aren\'t affecting you.        /(hudson) /The central character in Dostoevsky\'s novel, Crime and Punishment,  /(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and /stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could /make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of  /much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.   One of the central points of any (that\'s ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)  This freshman /wants to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him.  If he hurts /a player on the team, it might slightly lessen the chances of the team to /win, but he might gain great personal benefit.  So, operating on purely /selfish (immorally selfish) motives, he arranges for a sniper to shoot a /team player in the leg.  He gets to play in front of the talent scout.  /Did that freshman behave morally?  /Selfish intentions may sometimes generate (apparently) moral actions, but /not always.    Two problems right off the bat:  1.  The problem with your analogy is that it doesn\'t address the goal that I started with:  winning the game.  Playing in front of the talent scout != winning the game.  Try creating the same analogy and keep the ultimate goal the same, will you?';3

I don\'t think you\'d get on with Jesus, though- he was a long-haired lunatic peace-nik, was he not?   Right.  Unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too.  I think you\'re being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I understand it, that is not the case- we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people.   Oh, come on.  With wars like the Falklands fresh in people\'s minds, that sort of propaganda isn\'t going to fool anyone.   Yes?  And what about the millions of casualties the Russians suffered?  It\'s hardly surprising the US didn\'t lose many men in WW2, given that you turned up late. ';0

1798;'Let me begin by saying I think this is the world\'s first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become  common.  The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\'s accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.  For example,  Story of Adam and Eve: Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide  in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden. (There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered God.)  Traditional Philosophy: 1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\'s OK. This is why married women usually didn\'t work until recent decades. 2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler  and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without  question by ordinary people, who can\'t make decisions for themselves.  Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy: They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their Father said to.  Being forced to leave the  Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.  Lessons from Traditional Interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read welfare) is ideal.  Get- ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment. 3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad. 4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and  should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for  themselves. 5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.  1990\'s philosophy: 1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless named Hillary Clinton or Murphy Brown. 2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people  (binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.  Interpretation of events based on current philosophy: They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them- selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were  REWARDED by being allowed into the real world.  Lessons from new interpretation: 1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought. 2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read welfare) is at best a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal. 3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good. 4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and alter or abolish bad governments.  They should think for themselves. 5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children  without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children (and themselves).  I have tentatively named this new philosophy The Church of Eveism because Eve\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\'s first good decision, instead of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek  knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it  until it was actively sought.  ---End serious discussion.

811;'  This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science- some of it is relevant in technology.  There was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary.  During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  were not exactly in the areas of the scientists\' expertise.  This is probably because of the research mind approach, which is not to try to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems, the job got done.  The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations, making it more difficult for them to act to support research.  The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding, and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose, as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask for one?  The answer I will get is, Get the money from NSF.  Now the money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects get supported, and how much.    Also, the government decided that the wealth should be spread.  So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find  impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday\'s too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,  and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  more than minimal attention of a good researcher.    I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.';2

467;' The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and  exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians  in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn\'t hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator.   How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made- targets are misidentified- innocents die.  That\'s war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, I know not what course others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free.      Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\'m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor  French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We  should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\'d be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\'t understand diplomacy- they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\'s sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait  was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\'ve been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.    Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.         Regards,';0

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions- some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  What is atheism?  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the weak atheist position, and the latter as strong atheism.  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  Weak atheism is simple scepticism- disbelief in the existence of God.  Strong atheism is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists.  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods- others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  But isn\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\'t exist?  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false- one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  What is agnosticism then?  The term \'agnosticism\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (strong) atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism, and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism.  Beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\'t the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it\'s best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  But isn\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don\'t exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time- they don\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\'t conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists- instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  But what if God is essentially non-detectable?  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though- otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don\'t exist?  OK, you may think there\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but  isn\'t it still a religious belief?  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game.  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an agreed fact, but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question Isn\'t atheism a religious belief? depends crucially upon what is meant by religious.  Religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not   religion according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  OK, so it\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith, like religion is?  Firstly, it\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible- and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called acts of faith, then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain.  This is not a general tendency, however- there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\'t really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  If atheism is not religious, surely it\'s anti-religious?  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against, friend or enemy.  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism- in that sense, it can be said to be anti-religion.  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being anti-religious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a live and let live attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to convert others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of state atheism came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  But if you don\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,  surely that\'s the same as state atheism?  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  What about prayer in schools? If there\'s no God, why do you care if people  pray?  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don\'t pray can\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\'t  atheists object to the religious charities?  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\'t worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\'s somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To weak atheists, building a hospital to say I do not believe in God is a rather strange idea- it\'s rather like holding a party to say Today is not my birthday.  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  You said atheism isn\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism- although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  How do atheists differ from religious people?  They don\'t believe in God.  That\'s all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  Unexceptional? But aren\'t atheists less moral than religious people?  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don\'t obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (right) and unacceptable (wrong) behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from anti-social or immoral behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don\'t know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:    Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,    be honor and glory forever and ever.  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after born again experiences.  While only 4\% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being born again, 12\% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly, 5\% had used illegal drugs before    conversion, 9\% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation- 5\% after.                                 [Freethought Today, September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  Is there such a thing as atheist morality?  If you mean Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?, then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?, then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world \'ought\' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  Then aren\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90\% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial- they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  But don\'t atheists want to believe in God?  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the Big Brother figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough- there must be evidence for the belief.  But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind- but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as Of course God is there, you just aren\'t looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  Isn\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning.  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking What is the meaning of life? is as silly as asking What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?.  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?  There are many ways of obtaining comfort- from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\'s just hard luck.  Don\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?  The short answer is No, do you?  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven\'t resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\'t the same arguments  apply?  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take- it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  What sort of harm?  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\'s not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings- think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church\'s opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  Those weren\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\'s hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\'s a REAL Christian and who isn\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can\'t decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\'t be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\'t he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren\'t a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don\'t exist, but that doesn\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  Well, if atheism\'s so great, why are there so many theists?  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is, or whether it works- consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar- for example, it\'s worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\'s rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human- she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of memes -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them- don\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\'s up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life, as it\'s probably the only one you\'ll have.     It\'s no good relying on some external power to change you- you must change    yourself.     Just because something\'s popular doesn\'t mean it\'s good.     If you must assume something, assume something it\'s easy to test.     Don\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

737;' Hmm.  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as officers and yelling Police repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug houses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it\'s a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight.  Usually this strategy works- if it didn\'t, then it wouldn\'t be used so commonly, now would it?  Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my point, since I don\'t think any of us have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue.  I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day. Furthermore, we don\'t know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers\'s badges?  Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which can\'t be faked by the competition?  Even if you\'ve got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that\'s not an excuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD\'s, there was almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.';3
182;'   Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion, a lie. I can\'t believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence.   I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one\'s belief critically.  I\'ll tell you something I left out of my \'testimony\' I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over, I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works, thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.   I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.  As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student\'s workload considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first attempt. However, I think I\'ll never forget the lesson:   No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X, it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent.  But it can still be wrong.   I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear,  filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god playing any part.    Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions- for instance, the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.  Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.   This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind, and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the evidence.   It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not. I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.   A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible again.   I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I\'m lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is  very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore. But I can\'t go on lying to myself.  Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind. But if god really wants me, she\'ll know what to do. I\'m willing. I just don\'t know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence, it looks like she doesn\'t.   Petri';0
898;' I suppose you don\'t know what about we have discussed. We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.  So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didn\'t tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place.  Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There\'s no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image.    Ok, you\'re writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit.  My solution doesn\'t work, because there\'s no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image- going back to 8bit is silly.   About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I don\'t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images.  Moreover, XV is not a paint program- you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there\'s need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don\'t see full 24bit image, there\'s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that.  Ok, I don\'t have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...    It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs- jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image- say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.  I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.  So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.  Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where \'up\' means that the lift goes down and \'down\' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn\'t solve the problem. (Americans: the lift is just an example :)   Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to read it. ';1
1206;'  We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\'t seem so bad.  What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at different x/y values, the ridges are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   Example:   Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)       Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)  Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo!

1047;'Re: Space billboards  Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered a Goodyear Blimp in orbit.  The idea was to use a large structure that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has. Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing it.  It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here because I don\'t want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such a thing, go figure it out for yourself).  Dani Eder ';2

Otherwise it\'s better to simply launch the probes independently.  The outer planets are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on the way to Neptune.  Don\'t judge interplanetary trajectories in general by what the Voyagers did:  they exploited a lineup that occurs only every couple of centuries, and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect route to Neptune.   Solar sails are pretty useless in the outer solar system.  They\'re also very slow, unless you assume quite advanced versions.';2

1596;'(References: deleted to move this to a new thread)    To put it as simply as possible: *I am not a Muslim*.[...] I do not  accept the charge of apostacy, because I have never in my adult life  affirmed any belief, and what one has not affirmed one can not be  said to have apostasized from.  The Islam I know states clearly that  \'there can be no coercion in matters of religion\'.  The many Muslims  I respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their  faith *purely by virtue of birth*, and that a person who freely chose  not to be a Muslim could therefore be put to death.     \t    \t    \t    \tSalman Rushdie, In Good Faith, 1990  God, Satan, Paradise, and Hell all vanished one day in my fifteenth  year, when I quite abruptly lost my faith.

No thunderbolt arrived to strike me down.

I\'ll accept it (reluctantly) from mobs in Pakistan, but not from you.  What is presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the actual Mohammad.  What\'s worse, the novel doesn\'t present the Mahound/Mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories of Islam- in particular, there is no lewd misrepresentation of his life or that of his wives.   Don\'t hold back- he\'s considered an apostate and a blasphemer. However, it\'s not for his writing in _The Satanic Verses_, but for what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is contained in that book.  I have yet to find *one single muslim* who has convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initially claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial Newsweek story might impart, and all have made factual misstatements about events in the book.

Charley,  I can\'t help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don\'t answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I\'ll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren\'t referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don\'t fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:    2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by, and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...   then later...   then later...    3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:    then later...    4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldn\'t help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don\'t retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] [Second quote]   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn\'t respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text?  Here is the context for the question:    then later...

Any death by suffocation asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).

1825;'   # I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don\'t agree # with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.    # And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the # Holy Qur\'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition # cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory # about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the evil # which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic.       Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is      metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not      the same way?  # The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane # in human language is something like describing color to a person # who has been blind from birth.

But, like all models, a compro- # mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness # of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all # crippled.  But what else can you do?       This is why I asked the above.  How would you then      know God exists as a spirit or being rather than      just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\'s okay to say      well, Satan is just metaphorical, but then you      have to justify this belief AND justify that God is      not some metaphor for something else.       I say this because there are many, many instances of      Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in       the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the      New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is      described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know      one is metaphorical and not the other.       Further, belief in God isn\'t a bar to evil.  Let\'s      consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were      metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe      in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a       case where someone does believe in God, but by      religious standards, they are evil.  If Bobby      does see this, let him address this question also.

1308;'Let\'s see. These aren\'t, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A D engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An F engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size O are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottom Line: It\'s legit.

629;'Hello netters,     I\'m new to this board and I thought this might be the best place for my post.  I have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies, the CIA utilizes its orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa. The photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My question is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the British SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was watching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is, one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.

29;'isaackuo@skippy.berkeley.edu (Isaac Kuo) states in reply to deleted article about no-knock searches, arrests    In general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence, like drugs, which can be flushed down the toilet.  They are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber.  If there is no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hands up.  If the suspect does not come out tear gas will be used.   comment on the BD omitted    It is not a method to apprehend criminals.   It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way.  It is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room and they don\'t know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the place and announce yourself.    Cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.   Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they are arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea bargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals aren\'t aware that they are cops.  No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not committed any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the housebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.  The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called for.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could have surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet. ';3

He called them the Great Commission but this is NOT descriptive of Jesus\'s words in Matt. 10:15.  Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:  \tAnd if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have \tto say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust \tfrom your feet.  Matt. 10:15:   \tI tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not   \tgo as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with   \tthat town.   > The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^  The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.  And Dean countered:  Actually, this comment of your\'s is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to characterize that as ignoring the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.  Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of instruction to spread the word.  All these quotes btw are from:  Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>   And I claim it correctly, because my question went:  Do you, too, measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?  and the closest Dean came to an answer was:  Peter, Peter, Peter.  You\'re just so stupid, pretentious, dull, and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is.  Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this, yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:  So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted.  If you\'re still unable to figure it out, ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really doesn\'t take much sophistication to understand.  On top of which, I doubt that the answer is at all representative of Dean\'s true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean\'s  mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken. One wonders whether Dean\'s mind is so warped as to find sport in all this.  He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread:  You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it \t\t\t\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the sins of other individuals. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\'s sins. That I made public announcements of the sins of others --sins, BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in the posts of others-- is a different matter.  Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread, YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.  Dean again:  You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to paint Jews as plaster saints, thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.  Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.  I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about plaster saints,  suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.  In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as the basis of one insult after another.';3

140;'  Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by sentence.   1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.  Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?  2) Science cannot explain origins.  This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends on what origins we are talking about.  3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science.  Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of higher truth is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science- they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither higher or  lower- they are simply true.  More to the point, restricting one\'s discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge- it simply restricts the scope of discussion.  4) This is a false premise.  If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.  5) By the way, I enjoy science.  On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read. However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy, perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.  6) It is truly a wonder observing God\'s creation.  Let us not quibble- count this one as true.  7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]  Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification:  Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.  -----  It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.';3

353;' The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate  onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh  envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.   You\'ve hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.  It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,  the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.  That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........    The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don\'t know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM\'s I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which don\'t have the ullage problem that cryo\'s  do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems  could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with  providing centaur GSE to Russia.

So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs.  In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies. This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet, and any other source!';2
564;'  (Deletion)   Yes, sorry. I have got that wrong. My apology.     (Deletion)     So? No fun, but I must have met the minority then. And given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something.     Rob, I am not intimate with Jewish theology, but I understand that you are a Messianic Jew. Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.     (Deletion)   The context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion. I wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.     (Deletion)   Is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds. The context is repulsive, and it is foul play, IMO, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book.     (Big deletion)   No, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of the bible. As in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god. The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo- logic question) is proof of a theology used.       It is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can\'t becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place? Can\'t it be replaced somehow? Is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that is included as well?     (Deletion)   Sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system.   (Deletion)   If we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?     And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.';0

1324;'Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:                           The Next Step                                    The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase  Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act.                               There is a small group of activists in southern California  who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon.         Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert  for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993.         All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown\'s office. As more is known, it will be passed on.         However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits)- be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we\'re out of luck there)- or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose.                             This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources  Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons\' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson\'s staff review a bill.         If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians.         If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society).';2

1386;' John 12:24-26: Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone- but if it dies, it produces much grain.   He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.   If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me- and where I am, there My servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.  Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?  If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us?  Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass- I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.  In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn\'t automatically mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.  If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these- and if it does, then they will be very strong and true.   Jesus wasn\'t the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend, if memory serves.  But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?   If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.   That\'s precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin. Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?   You\'ve got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition.  Truth is, it\'s not.  Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply- he just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.  But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view, which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here\'s the problem with that: substitute Moslem or Buddhist or Satanist instead of Christian, and it means the same thing.  Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD, you\'ve got some convincing to do.   And in my opinion, you\'re bumbling about blindly making up entities where there aren\'t any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself, I\'ll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.';3

Similarly, a moral relativist will not judge one moral system to be better than another in every possible circumstance.  This does not, however, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another in a specific set of circumstances.  Nor does it preclude a set of moral relativists from collectively judging a moral system, from some set of circumstances which they all agree they are in.   Eh?  Could you explain this?  Which that statement are you talking about?   I still don\'t quite see what you\'re trying to say.  I assume by values you mean moral values, yes?  In which case, what do you mean by real?  What is a real moral value, as opposed to an unreal one?   Sorry, but in what way is it an infinite regress?  It looks extremely finite to me.   Sorry, but that\'s not so.  I can provide a justification for asserting that the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace.  I just can\'t provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances.  Similarly, I can provide a justification for asserting that bullets move faster than snails.  That justification won\'t hold in all possible frames of reference, but it will hold in almost all the frames of reference I am ever likely to be in.   I don\'t think I agree with this.  My saying it *does* make it so *from my point of view* and according to *my premises*, unless the argument is invalid.

Also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass  requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional S/A).

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   program with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects\' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been   developed by Spyglass.

TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the   other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm   development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily   extensible through script (or indirect command) files. These script   files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.   The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame   grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides   conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.    Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200  Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------   It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all   sorts of image enhancing on it. You\'ll need at least a Mac II with co-   processor- a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn\'t   run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1    In the documentation the contact address is given as:  Liz Smith, Jet   Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109   (818) 354-6980  Visualization Workbench -----------------------   An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image   analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.    Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112  Adobe Photoshop ---------------    The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey   scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with   various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS   applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.   Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100\%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the auto selection tool   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don\'t know...    Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100  Dapple Systems --------------   High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to   work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of   global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.    Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by painting it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator paint with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include- image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose.    Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn\'t have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing programs for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software.    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: Laplacian, medium noise filter, etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can\'t be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance- count objects- determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement- perform object feature   extraction- and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.    Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900  IPLab -----   Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277   FAX 703-281-2509    Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or   pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.

I was using it on my thesis &   then changed the topic a bit & that work became secondary.    ERDAS, Inc. 2801 Buford Highway Suite 300 Atlanta, GA 30329 404-248-9000   FAX   404-248-9400  RSVGA -----   I have been getting up to speed on a program called RSVGA available from   Eidetic Digital Image Ltd. in British Columbia.  Its for IBM PC\'s or   clones, cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff Erdas does but is not   as fast or as powerful, though I have had only limited experience with   Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good   starter program except for the obtuse manual  IMAGINE-32 ----------   It\'s a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called Imagine32   or Image32 The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,   subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.   It can also display a number of images simultaneously.   The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA.   PC Vista --------   It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.  It is known to   be available from Mike Richmond, whose email addresses have been  \trichmond@bllac.berkeley.edu \trichmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu    and his s-mail address is:    Michael Richmond,Astronomy Department, Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720    The latest version of PC-Vista, version 1.7, includes not only the source   code and help files, but also a complete set of executable programs and   a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code,   you will need Microsoft C, version 5.0 or later- other compilers may work,   but will require substantial modifications.

Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.   Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical   image community. They issue a newsletter also.   They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last   I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells.    It\'s suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows.   Very flexible/extendable  -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of   documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer.  ALV ---   A Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to   comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to   alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.  AIPS ----   Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - AIPS++ - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\'s environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,   automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically   and carefree.    It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn\'t that   difficult to write your own with their programmer\'s module.    Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\'s Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters\'\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98\% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,    point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and    quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights    or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass    back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)    to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system. o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to    HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

249;' #Recently, I\'ve asked myself a rather interesting question: What RIGHT does #god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god, of course...!) ?? # #In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don\'t live #according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god #make that desicion? Let\'s say, for the sake of argument, that god creates #every one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn\'t matter.). What then #happens, is that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn\'t #ask to be created. # #Let\'s make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature #(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the #right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?  Dear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions, but that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there are respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you, me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9) in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression, an earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of God\'s spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer\'s plan, most followed the Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer\'s aspirations (I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . . Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and those who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who became Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven (And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth . . . Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).  To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to God and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices), we made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? Job 38:4-7).  We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the Veil of Forgetful- ness, somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.  You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.  #Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so #righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep, #unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? # #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.  (All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd as they understand Him  --)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe in the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They will cry heresy and other accusations of perverting the doctrines of the Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)  As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea Scroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not least, modern-day revelation on the subject.  #I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it. # #                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that #                        he is acting according to God\'s will, and who there- #     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by #                        stabbing you in the back? # #                                                        -Voltaire ';3

Okay, so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable evidence?  I didn\'t realize you were a theist.  I am doubting a claim presented without any evidence to support it.  If you are able to present real evidence for it, then great.  But unsupported claims, or even claims by such and such news agency will not be accepted.  If you want to stick to the sheer impossible, instead of the merely difficult, then fine.    The statement that if such a fact is classified, then you  can\'t prove it, is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law.  If you  have access to classified information that you know to be classified, and you reveal it, there is a good chance that you or someone else  (the person who revealed it to you), is going to jail.    I never said that you couldn\'t prove it to my satisfaction, I merely said that it was difficult.

Science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either     real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)     experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive     confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike     (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to     follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests     that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they     are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and this may not be your real intent.      2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his     statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the     quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.     Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context     and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate     scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may     not be your real intent.      3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of     evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one     line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that     disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate     claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck     proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond     of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not     actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.      4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack     on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on     science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the     fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long     ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and     irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a     creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.   Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:   * Neither I, nor Webster\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *    I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (The Neck of the Giraffe).  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution (the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a non sequitur (i.e. the conclusion does not follow). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]    Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was titled `Giraffe\' sticks scientific neck out too far.  Excerpts include :    Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.  He goes after Darwin like Mark   Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and   pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.  He suggests   a mystical `organizing principle\' of life, using the similarity of organs   in different creatures as evidence [sic].    Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\'t surprise me much.  It\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e. he only posted a quote). ';0
1378;'  Well, if you\'re going to get upset with this, you might as well direct some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.

358;'We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform.  This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth\'s atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from off the shelf technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  We have several questions:  1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?  2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies?  3.

882;'  You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)  However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )  I suppose that the right to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one.

784;'The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW as will be covered with this treatise.  MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW) is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed the last Holy Scripture, Qur\'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him) through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\'an by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between 571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW, is a treason against Islam, against Qur\'an, against the message of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah. He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\'an is from  Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:  \tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men, \tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal \tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of \tall things.  --------------------- Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed, it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The  Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers. Allah\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom, for Allah has full knowledge of all things.  ---------------------- DROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2  A   D R O P L E T From The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\'an  Translations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of  Bediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor  VOL 1, No 11, Part 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------    \t\t NINETEENTH LETTER    \t\t MU\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI  (A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)         (continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)     SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW) declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a decree as the Glorious Qur\'an and manifest miracles which number, according to the scholars, one thousand. The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise Our\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids)  sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars of Islam) to the hundreth degree.    The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of the universe of His declaration of Prophethood- it has the effect of the words,\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\'    Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler, while being observed by Him, \'The true ruler has appointed me to such and such position.  \'At a time when you were asked to prove your claim, the word \'Yes\' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word \'Yes.\'    In the same way, ALLAH\'s Most Noble Messenger claimed: \'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at this food: although it is barely enough for two or three men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \'Further he shows hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral conduct and manners, his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness. Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief merely by seeing him, and said, \'No lie can hide in this face, nor can any fraud be found in it!\'    Although many of the  researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand, there are thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways.    The Wise Our\'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away- then, the prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets. ';3

1687;' In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don\'t have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)

You refer to # differing interpretations of create, and say that many Christians may # not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is # truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.  It may be irrelevant to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say bias?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You\'re right, the bottom line IS truth, independant from you or anyone else.  Since you proclaim truths as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what authority you do this?  Because it says so in the Bible?  --Does the Bible say so, or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or disapproval?  Excuse moi, but your line of truths haven\'t moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the preachers of truth on this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking crew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever. BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees: ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips, but your hearts are far removed from me...  # Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created # and eternally existent are equivalent, you say granted the Mormon # belief... You can\'t grant your conclusion and then expect the point to # have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address # and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the # conclusion that you grant.  Sophistry.  Look who\'s talking: jumping to conclusions?  You wouldn\'t do that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever.  # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus # is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS # belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.  A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine.  The former KGB would have loved to employ you. Jesus and lucifer are not the same, silly, and you know it.  (...)  # The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is # nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible # says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:  Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not children (=followers/redeemed) of God, but it doesn\'t mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation.  # #        The field is the world- the good seed are the children of the #        kingdom- but the tares are the children of the wicked one- #        (Matthew 13:38)  kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue of satan\'s spirit-offspring (and those who followed him) has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non- related scriptures.

In this single posting of yours, I\'ve seen more constructs of imagination than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about the only true God, whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring. It doesn\'t address any issue raised, but #  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read #  something into the Bible, doesn\'t change what the Bible teaches.  Sigh.  What the Bible teaches?  Or: what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co.?  I respect the former, I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).  (...)  #  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of #  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were \'official doctrine.\' I don\'t #  think that it matters if McConkie\'s views were canon. That is not the #  issue.  Were McConkie\'s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this #  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may #  certainly be.  The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of official doctrine is obviously very important.  McConkie\'s views have been controversial (e.g. The Seven Deadly Heresies has made me a heretic!  --) at best, or erroneous at worst (blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation).  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book Mormon Doctrine is oftentimes referred to as McConkie\'s Bible in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\'s books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

824;'Wm Hathaway comments-    I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the \'pristine\' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don\'t think there\'s any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, just because it has changed the way we strive.  BTW, there are places that people haven\'t fouled.

841;'  When Robert refers to the orthodox, he is talking about the Historical position of the Christian Faith. Such things are derived from Biblcal texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.  You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this is alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs, there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the doctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the texts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be. According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.';3

Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF/1 ( DEC\'s ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are binary compatible with Digital\'s OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by simply adding transformation engines.

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free  to contact me. The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster.  Those of you who don\'t know what all this is about, read on.  ********  Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is: -------------------------------------  Didn\'t you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of  drawing three-dimensional scenes?   Didn\'t you always want to write this program that visualized the structure  of three-dimensional molecules?  And didn\'t the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from  actually doing it?  Well if the answer to any of the above questions is \'Yes, but what has it to  do with this package???\' , read on.  GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines  for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating  (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling)  three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.  GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.  GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections (If you can\'t understand a word, don\'t worry, this is just showing off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on).   GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you don\'t have to worry about that if you don\'t want to)  GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above  processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac. Both versions are *100\% source compatibel*.   GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package.  If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library.  However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select \'OOP-Guild\'.  GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed. ';1
57;'   Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled, Habitable Planets for Man (I think) in 1964.  It should be available in most good libraries, or through inter-library loan.     It answered the questions you ask (speculatively, of course), along with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies: length of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural concerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of xenon narcosis?  neither did I), density of particulates in the atm, and their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.     Climate isn\'t a global phenomenon and probably needn\'t concern you, but axial tilt ought to.

So wind has to bend away from the wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.  If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into,  then drag is reduced.     Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage.

To try to convince you all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.    Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is a prime cause (in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying it is the prime cause or the only cause, just a prime cause -- i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I admit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that extra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century.';0
1926;'    {Description of External Tank option for SSF redesign deleted}   Yo Ken, let\'s keep on-top of things! Both the External Tank and Wingless Orbiter options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles, and building a station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today\'s Times).  Option A - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are:   -  Uses Bus-1, a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\'s      qualified for STS and ELV\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A Power Station Capability is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option B - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option B team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option A). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options A and B.  The build-up occurs in six phases:   -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A Two Fault Tolerance Capability is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.';2

627;' Superficially a good answer, but it isn\'t that simple.  An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea- instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\'ve got.  Perhaps it\'s more accurate to say that there\'s a Western ethic against Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World, we couldn\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the supposed Pro-Life movement, too.  They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion.  Hell, if they\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China.  And besides, Suzanne\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory forced abortion in Tibet, I don\'t believe this to be the case. ';3

1368;'   It\'s not a bad question: I don\'t have any refs that list this algorithm either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn\'t be too hard.  1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)  2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere.  3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere\'s origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.  4) the radius is easy to compute, it\'s just the distance from the center to any of the original points.  I\'ll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.';1
246;' I agree, which is why I\'ve asked for help with it.  The reason I\'m working on this list is because I\'ve recently had one too many Christians tell me the Bible contains no contradictions whatsoever.  They believe that it\'s true, and that it describes reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.  Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these people, I\'ve got to SHOW them, with concrete evidence, that the Bible is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with this list.  Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat denials.  I\'ve never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are indeed two different accounts of creation. ';3

1258;' Well, it\'s not that simple -- you\'re in Earth\'s magnetic field, and you don\'t generate electricity -- but it can be done.   The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say propel rather than power, the answer is sort of.)  Yes, you can use interaction with the Earth\'s magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential applications for this.  However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn\'t coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations, however.  What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays, and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.  If you want more information, trying looking up electrodynamic propulsion, tether applications, and magsails.   No.  A dragless satellite does not magically have no drag- it burns fuel constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* there was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around dragless.';2

392;'   Cute characterization Bill- however, there is no inconsistency between  the two statements.  Even if one believes that religion is primitive,  simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish, one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation.  The ideas themselves don\'t have to be complex before being excised by Occam\'s Razor, they only have to add  unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.   I think the non-essential part of an explanatory system is one that adds no predictive capability to the system.   Huh?   ^^^^^ Watch it, your Freudian Slip is showing ';0
1662;'  Really>`?   No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don\'t need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone\'s guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.   Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered immoral under the previous definitions of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.   It seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would necessitate some sort of grand design?   I think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired behaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive, or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is, immoral to what end?).';0

It makes more sense to see it as 65536 possible shades of pure red. This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours)  may produce visible \'jumps\' in intensity.

1758;' I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic.    There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references.  It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but I don\'t think it\'s very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes this position, but that\'s because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus.)';3

Problem is, the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily, and the Justice department will be using the keys to listen in on illegal activities.  Many people are really scared about such an initiative because it is a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things like email if you read the press release.  The project was developed by NSA and given to NIST.  It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the government claims are needed to break the code.  They claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip), they have to get the keys from both companies.

This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy- you need proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren\'t doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it\'s not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but it\'s basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.';2

CRITZ, III <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague  Birth Announcement on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe                        Information Service ===================================================================                        FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT                      -------------------                                        (SM)                         EnviroLeague   A new youth movement,EnviroLeague, was recently born, according to its founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,    moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible, said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern-        (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use, including suitable             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable-        (3)  To serve as a clearing house for the exchange             of program ideas, materials and information             among said organizations-  and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three Program Divisions serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of EnviroLeague Teams, either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the draft portions of the Mentor\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\'s founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\'s Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named EnviroLeague. ============================================================================   Subsequently, EnviroLeague\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as a group.  -- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --  Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software, I\'m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.  You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!  -- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --  To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain  Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon.  There shouldn\'t be too much of a delay in joining.  Expect a welcome message within 5 days after you send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!  -- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --  Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the following address:          lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com  Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This doesn\'t mean it hasn\'t been posted to the list.  In fact, just the opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldn\'t be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address.  NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.  -- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --  Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain  I will remove your name from the list of members.

1085;'Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example, Why couldn\'t Magellan just be told to go into a safe mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments turned off rather than just safed.  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat\'s hair....    I\'ve heard the argument that an active but uncontrolled spacecraft causes radio noise.  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed safe mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it\'s lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a pause mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission drift phase.  So any holes in all this? ';2

1319;' I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world (tm) it\'s easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those people who are of the same opinion as they are.  In college you are constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have different ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  It is much much harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else\'s ideas from reaching you.

1151;'Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe:  The *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured in the past. These *facts* exist with or without a theory.  The *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.  The *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation, relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact... or even why.  A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported* by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation,  a model.  If it is a good model, it may be useful.  In science a theory is something that is supported by the  evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence. A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not yet enough evidence to support it.  When a new hypothesis  is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or predict new facts.

144;'Archive-name: space/probe Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $  PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression R-dot-bar sub n (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Sun\'s energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a dead world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earth\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a dead planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,     and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planet\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send     back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\' sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994- but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers\' efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side note: VIKING 1\'s lander has been designated the     Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive     jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titan\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\' appearance was     startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.     The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptune\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\'s liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.

LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was \t     also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images \t     from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 \t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were \t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil \t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in \t      1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\'s \t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished \t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in \t      1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions \t       lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with \t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in \t       February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. \t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe \t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending \t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before \t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles \t       similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet \t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in \t       1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the \t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar \t       mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. \t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of \t\tplanet\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian \t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on \t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in \t     March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased \t     enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian \t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian \t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red \t     Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander \t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to \t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in \t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. \t     probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit \t     with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\' largest \t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to \t       human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did \t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week \t       before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halley\'s Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\'s. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\'s radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromo\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecraft\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\'s atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,     1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the     approach:  \tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km \tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km \tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) \tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES      I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three     groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,     and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means     complete- it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and periodicals:      NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth\'s     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

229;'  I assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has Tony Campello read?  Not much it seems.    It is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about. If only those christian scientists would take note.  (In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian  scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are  trying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed  light has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been  accounted for. :-] )   Or (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never  intended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one up?   Millions of people have died for a lie.  This  point is difficult to  substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed  themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.     That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to the claim that Jesus was the real thing.    Have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the point, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based  (I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with  his principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane....      Hmmm.... I don\'t think his arguments warrant the use of a Therefore...   This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.     Tony\'s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone,  who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b.       That would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed  in religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct.    It   I think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames than here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people.   Someone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one rules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.  If I am pressed I could probably find the exact quotation.';0

1653;' <Moral Driver distinctions deleted>   Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge and an object. The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable.  Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven\'t attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I misunderstood?   My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this will probably take several generations to be effective. I don\'t think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.  I\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:  I\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen \'amplitudes\', and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time.  Conscience is a little more difficult because I can\'t define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one\'s Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with Freud\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\'s Ego, I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?. I think I need some more time with this one.  That\'s about it for now!  David.  --- On religion:';3
2002;'      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we\'re seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) \tAs the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda\'s bursters. \tThe data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is the edge of the Universe --) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.  \tIf we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources --)  [in the colliding NS they\'d actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that it\'s  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.  If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...';2

That is why there are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against orbiting billboards because people don\'t feel morally justified to complain on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth\'s ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

55;' This is one of those yes, but things. It\'s true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube, but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily, though it\'s straight-on compressive strength is high, and it\'s torsional  resistance increase is practically nil. On the other grasping member,  there\'s no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature. Tree roots  are an example. Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases.   Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don\'t think so. If you take the view that the tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion. I don\'t know much about panda thumbs, so I\'ll ask is it opposable?   Well I won\'t say flat out that they can\'t be intelligent, but I\'ll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I don\'t think it\'s likely. First let me say that when I say intelligent I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter  it\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\'s certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice for a putative technological alien.  Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but it\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur wouldn\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\'s room for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages  that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures. So there\'s little selection pressure for such brains. Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\'t rule out intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.  Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it\'s internal heat is rapidly lost due to it\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature that must spend most of it\'s time and energy feeding won\'t have the time to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak. The dinosaur\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\'s heat production  because it\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat.  I\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature the size of a brontosaur, it\'s activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity.  Gary';2

503;' You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead. Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.   Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it.   Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true. Which is it Allen?   As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong. Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.   Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?   Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big. They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.    I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.   No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have  happened in the first place.  I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to  change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position.';2
1160;'Here\'s a suggestion for the logical argument FAQ.  I don\'t think it\'s covered, though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one I used:  How about it, mathew?  INCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE  This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes stand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is either a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same source.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying see, the source really does say B, it\'s right here!- this reply does not refute the allegation of inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.  Example of the first type: The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in these ways.  We can both agree these are immoral.  The Koran clearly says in this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way.  Example of the second type: There are two Biblical creation stories.

The Christians  got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems  invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling  into Moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners, not the  Moslems), or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it.  Either way, a tremendous amount of information was lost. The destruction of the library of Alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man against man.   Actually, the Hebrew almah, (young woman), was translated as the Hellenistic  Greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the modern and technical English term virgin. The Jews did not have the type of virginity cult that the Greco-Romans had in Artemis and Diana.   The standard text used by Christians and Jews is the Masoretic Text.

But am I the only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.  A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:  \t1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly low orbit.  \t2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?  \t3) Which is more important- adding a few extra days of \'seeing\' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.  \t4) If your answer to 3) above was the astronomers, then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

1111;'Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more bare-bones.  In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn\'t get to the mike, maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it in.  After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.  So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all the difference.  So, on to the substance. The question was   Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass?  Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last part first.  This is to the best of my recollection what he said.  As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers  about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point.  So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that  they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own.  Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually, this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts.  He won\'t tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are trying to do something with it.    Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?';2

1411;'Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas, rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject:   and    Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word apacgw, you will find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:  \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Louw and Nida \tRobinson\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament \tGreek English Lexicon of the New Testament, Grimm \tWord study Concordance, Tynsdale \tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  \t early Christian Writings, Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon, Perschbacher  A couple simply stated hanged oneself, and a couple were more explicit  and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging. A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw is strangle, throttle or choke (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, Robinson\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament, not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word apagchw has two root words: gchw is the to strangle root, and the root word apo means literally away. This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word apagello means to send a message).  Apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo, which means to kill. In literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle, strangle to put out of the way, and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word apacgw does mean to hang, it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means to hang oneself, to end one\'s life by hanging. He then notes the the use of apacgw in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide by hanging. Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of death, and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of apacgw (ie: Since the word apacgw was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of apacgw:   Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie the the Hebrew say and died), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added and died, the correct translation would still be apacgw, as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing apacgw and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose\'s statement about trees around the Potter\'s Field:   Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\' betrayal an iniquity, but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\' actions an iniquity either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took      Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling      him Buy what we need for the feast- or that he should give something      to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and      it was night.  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that apacgw means suicide.  You see, since Judas\' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the Field of Blood would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\'s field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:   I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\'s all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.   \t\t\t\tLater,  \t\t\t\tDave Butler  \tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence. \t\t\t\tDavid Hume, Philosopher \t\t\t\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding';3
557;'Dear Rob,   Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\'ll try to get better.  Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far, only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.  Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K.  vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest- the next is an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.   I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with his set of excuses.    I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.  From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I  see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away from the oncoming truck.  He doesn\'t see it.   Here\'s is how I see the dialog:   Me:  Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.   BK:  There is no truck.  Me:  Turn around at look.  BK:  No.  Me:  Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at      the oncoming truck.  BK:  No. Explain to me why trucks exist.  Me:  Turn around or you will run over.  BK:  No. I won\'t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.  Me:  You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.       I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.  BK:  It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.       Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.       And by the way, I really have an open mind.   So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?     I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have. I can now see the truck behind Brian.  My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment, Brian hasn\'t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. ';3

[*]  Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two\'s rising edge has a slope of 1/4. (I\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).  I\'ve run into two problems- I\'m sure that other readers have tried this before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:  1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the jaggies.  I\'m now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary). Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed, thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?  2) Wall 3 presents a problem- the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed. Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape?  Currently I take:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64  and produce:                           1  2  3  4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12             53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                         57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                     61 62 63 64  Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1. Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3. This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed?  Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering. Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.  [*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1) *are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points. This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\'t have to change size as they move about in the room).  I\'ve decided that this approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing.  Hopefully the context of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.  Thanks in advance for any help. ';1

1943;'Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40\% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3\% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3\% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3\% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15\% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.  Dani Eder ';2

728;' Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).  Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere  in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which  it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.  Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert, your proof is meaningless and it should not be repeated here.  What\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would prove nothing.  Scholars speak of the weight of evidence.  Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your belief is based on faith.  That\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact.  As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\'t a perfect canon be perfect?  Shouldn\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel  Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for  Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share  an evolutionary ancestry).  The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels prove your faith.  Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith.  Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted to prove your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than saying I am right because I say so.    Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian  General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where fundamentalist came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1) Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily resurrected, 4) Jesus\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe inerrant broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to  contain the first four.    Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!  Its faith, Bill.  You don\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else.  Whatever works for you.

24;'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published  solutions to it.  \tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the  edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw  the object we   1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively \tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the         curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume \tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not \texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable \tmeasure. 2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment \tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two \ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface. 3) Depth sort the triangles 4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw \tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is \talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge \tcolored with a special edge color  \tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface. The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated. They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area.';1

Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them.   There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The chassis simply couldn\'t be pushed any further.  I\'d say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups- we would have been out of our minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost from the day the 35 started shipping.

They don\'t get all that long a lead time either- although certainly they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the industry.

This can be from reading simple truths       in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.  ra> Who is that holds that Luke meant what you said he meant?       I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are      pertinent.       Luke 23:43 records Christ\'s promise to the repentant thief who hung on      an adjacent cross: Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in      paradise. But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead      and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until      Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The      answer lies in the location of paradise when Jesus died.       Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.       Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and       Lazarus as Abraham\'s Bosom, to which the godly beggar Lazarus was      carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus      Abraham\'s Bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed      waited till the day of Christ\'s Resurrection.       It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of       hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith      but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven      until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary- or      even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with      the Father.       Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the      repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But      on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene      (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then      took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise      (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in      Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: Ascending on high, He led captivity      captive- He gave gifts unto men. Verse 9 continues: But what does `He      ascended\' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the      earth? -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: He who descended is the same      as He who ascended above all the heavens. Presumably He led the whole      band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of      preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.  ra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is ra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to ra> look at the Bible in order to see the truth, but what of those who ra> see Biblical things differently from you?       I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my \'personal       interpretation\' is questioned, I usually give a reason.       As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where      there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it.        I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one       views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff       that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can       have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put       forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to       dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views      that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.  ra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really ra> understands it?       If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is       wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply       stating that there are other views is not a proof. Show it to me from       Scripture and then we can go on. ';3
1713;'  That\'s right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  It would be ideal if we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then determine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not possible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological burdens, too.   Well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism, they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually believing in racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you originated it.';0
1267;'   Sorry, but yes he does, by your own description.   Humorous, this notion of an all-knowing, all-powerful god who must attempt to reconcile with his lowly creations.  I realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic, but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything, and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of omniscience?  What you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god.    But all humans are sinners, thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been punished with death.  We aren\'t punished with sin now, of course, because God has changed.  He required a brutal, sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death.     Yet he does so now.  He has changed.  The sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins.  Besides, his midst is everywhere, so your statement is meaningless. He tolerates sin in Hell, which surely is in his midst as well.  Also, given that he is all-knowing, he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins, as well as when and where, so what does tolerance have to do with anything.  All of this is absolute nonsense, unless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful, or unless he doesn\'t take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim.   Not relevant.  The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in reference to your god.  The nature of his creations/victims is not at issue.   I see: an all-knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome would be, and an all-powerful god who had no choice in the matter. Mindmush.   Did I miss something?  Did you give some indication at to why a KIND and LOVING god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creations to achieve salvation?     I note that your answer physically follows my question, but I fail to discern a connection between the two.  By the way, for what am I being consoled?    Why not?  By the way, I note for the record that you didn\'t answer the questions.    Death and/or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional punishment?  I hope you aren\'t a parent.   This is quite an elaborate fantasy that you\'ve constructed, but sadly it lacks a basis in reality.  It also does not address the questions that I raised.   The god that you describe is not a good parent, but a tyrant.   Sorry, was that the god of the Bible whose rules I am to follow, or the god of the Koran?  The Vedas?  The Book of Koresh?  Oh, yes, it\'s all so clear. ';3

Your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires, since those did not represent *true* communism.  In judging the practical consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today, it is precisely the Khomeini\'s of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world Muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  Perhaps unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned with whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the Qur\'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how Islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like if Islam gains in influence.  When I consider such possibilities, it is with not inconsiderable fear.';0

Never lived out in the country I see. 4 years ago I had a place where I had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up  to copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water- heater called a flash-heater. A flash heater has a pilot lamp.  Here\'s the point. If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked  up to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces -- when the FBI started wrecking the place, they could easily have ruptured the lines. Which then would start spreading out through the overhead. And since it was a country home, it wasn\'t necessarily built with non-flamable insulation.   It\'s probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire started mainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part of the FBI, which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).  It\'s certain that if the tanks hadn\'t been used that day -- the fire wouldn\'t have started. ';3
888;' I hope I didn\'t award custody, Rich.  I purposely used handle in order to  avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are aberrations like scientific creationism).  I used best in part to indicate  that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are mostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the matter.  As an aside, for science I should have written how and when.  Nobody seems to argue over what.   Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\'m not trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works. On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which you know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological perspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I  think the masses can\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are  incapable- they just don\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to  be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore  it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for  dispensing answers to who and why.  I suggest that this holds regardless of  the truth in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.   In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as real as scientific facts and  explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).     No.  In fact, I don\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals.  Isn\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was  created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might  presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued  that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\'t have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\'s a tough one for people today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not  explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words,  I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific  as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but  I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will  be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty  convoluted here- I hope I\'ve made sense.     I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how,  when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment,  reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when,  and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the  naturalists\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely  leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.    Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn\'t it?  Well, I am sure there are plenty of scientific creationist rebuttals out there  somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, This second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away.   Japan\'s 8.3-meter Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!  And haven\'t you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research was done with Star Wars funding, and some is now being shared with astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their  theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.  To say that visible light astronomy is already a dying field is  pure hokum.  To use the logic that things are already bad, so it doesn\'t matter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logic are the dying fields.  George Krumins';2

207;' We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil  rights. Among these are drug abuse, sexual perversion, and political  incorrectness. Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants. He had been accused of a number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but  this is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse but this is somewhat stronger. It is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children- and ironicly considering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People\'s inherent goodness to believe he was protected. It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of  the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and  a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons had said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found that they have screwed up.  But they don\'t have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost.

433;' [ ... my stuff deleted ... ]   Bill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its sole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn\'t.  This board is used to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters\' experiences regarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to share resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others with similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come here to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism.     If you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic.     The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers into good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American Friends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread For The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring to mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names of some analagous Islamic groups?)    When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her Christianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the power to change the behavior of individuals-  if it is widespread enough, it can change societies.  The same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that religion has had no evil impacts on history.

424;'[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O\'Dwyer)]         From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:   Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For instance, \'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering\' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as \'5 + 7 = 12\' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content-  \'One ought always to do the right thing\' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of \'self-evident truths\', but can he deny the subjectivist\'s claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.';0

1329;'Stuff deleted  I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\'an. In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished.  Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.  However, when an apostate makes attacks upon God and His Messenger the situation changes. Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps  charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person  makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation changes. The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\'s case.  There is a distinction in the Qur\'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc.  against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm  to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation,  the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that  would apply in the case of Rushdie.  The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an  offensive book (banning the book is secondary) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many Muslims, and Rushdie\'s (and his publishers) Media games.     I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe that one of the Qur\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33. Every verse in the Qur\'an has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. It is not necessarily a simple this or that process. There may be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters impinge on the situation.  In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\'an. The Qur\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith. If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society, the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there  are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one  should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of  these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:  ...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one, and a decisive from an ambiguous- and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances  of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of the Qur\'an (whether simple or compound)- and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and delaying (in its verses)- and does not distinguish the clear from the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning from the termination- and is unaware of the question and the answer, the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive, and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one- and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful- and does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know the Qur\'an- nor is he among the people of the Qur\'an.....  Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\'anic verses (Why should not a company from every group remain behind  to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn  people when they return to them, so that they may beware. (9:122)), a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion) are many. I\'ve listed a few major  divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these headings.  - Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory). - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir. - Logic (mantiq) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters (rijal) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\'an, Sunnah, Consensus, Reasoning)  The study of Qur\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves: - discussion of imperatives (awamir) - discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi) - discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated  The principles of Application of the law involves: - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery  The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith.   Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as  long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures, and wealth of this world. The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: O Messenger of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves? He (S.A.) replied: By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for your religion and shun them. I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.  The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as The fortress of Islam. My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is  delineated in the Qur\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Qur\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion  are cautioned.  The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is, apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him.   I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup. Unfortunately, I do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like soc.religion.islam. How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?';0

Would you rather have someone love : you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to : love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward : Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.  Indeed, knock and it shall be opened to you. Dan, why didn\'t this work? I firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was only deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason what kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I  had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil\'s attempts to  destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy to achieve the same mental states at will.   My faith was just learned fear in a disguise.  : Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.  God is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years? If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief - what it was in my case - I\'d rather quit. If god does not help me to keep the faith, I can\'t go on.   Besides, I am concerned with god\'s morality and mental health. Does she really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations, guidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn\'t she make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who refuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture for those who can\'t believe?  I love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me, she\'ll know what to do.   : Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see : that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic. : Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is : the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never : know more than you do now.   Your argument is of the type you\'ll know once you try. Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed for many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that  they had lived in a virtual reality.  What else but reason I can use? I don\'t have the spiritual means  Christians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible. I don\'t even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my body - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so does my identity. God can entertain herself with copies of me if she wants.  : To learn you must accept that which you don\'t know.  What does this mean? To learn you must accept that you don\'t know  something, right-o. But to learn you must _accept_ something I don\'t know, why? This is not the way I prefer to learn. It is unwise to merely swallow everything you read. Suppose I write a book telling how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn (tm) has helped me in my daily problems, would you accept this, since you can\'t know whether it is true or not?  Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent, omnipresent, and loves just about everyone.

What evidence do you have that if such a creature(s) exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer hatred for what it/they have done in the past (whichever god(s) you care to pick).  That is assuming any records of their actions are correct.  Religon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate from the physical world.  Any belief system can leave you in such a state and so can drugs.  God(s) are not a requirement.  Only if you remove such useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon.

A client uses the      custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)      and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features      of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file      to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp      sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.    --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?  A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University      of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help      our campus find answers to their computer questions.         It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information      System used by a large number of sites in the world.       Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to      count.        The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached      via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:           Internet Gopher Developers       100 Union St. SE #190       Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA       Or via FAX at:         +1 (612) 625-6817  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?  A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.      As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:               - Search local WAIS indices.        - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using          built in gopher querying or using native http querying.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?  A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :       _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O\'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:                              ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)       _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet\'s Guide to Our World Online      By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to       Computerized Archives.       veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles      in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica       is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher      items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.      Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy      to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the      gopher protocol.       To try veronica, select it from the Other Gophers menu on       Minnesota\'s gopher server, or point your gopher at:       Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)       Type=1       Port=70       Path=1/veronica       Host=futique.scs.unr.edu  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Q8: What is Available for Biology?

I can\'t believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day, but nobody complains about that.  Besides, it\'s in LEO, so it would only be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time as it goes zipping across the sky.   No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so it would be no surprise.   Well, look on the, er, bright side.

28;'In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little programs. One is a C program that will perform a morph between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there  must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is  appreciated.';1

Another example of a moral system is presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see, to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is, we shall be moral unto what end?

INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing \'anonymous FTP\'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Don\'t even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large, and I won\'t attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here.

FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email, send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:  \tsend SPACE Index \tsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present- use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item VIEWING IMAGES below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers- this may be useful when pursuing     specific information.

Also included are suggested classroom     activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a     number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA     Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it     does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments     for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered     electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by     mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during     missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop     between the user and NASA.      SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs     useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images     from NASA\'s planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.      You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8     bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov     (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you\'re on the     Internet.

415;' No.  There are two problems here:  (1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but probably not much, because after all, I\'ve heard people claim with all sincerity that they\'ve spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his death, Peter\'s writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn\'t decide to change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little easier to understand.  (2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago, that doesn\'t mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God might just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he\'s a nice guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world today.  Nice try, but it just isn\'t enough to convince me, especially since your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way I\'ve observed the world to work.  Please find something more compelling. ';3

584;' I don\'t know.  Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is budgeted for the altitude change?  Henry,  any figures on the mass  (full)  for the EDO pallet  plus it\'s dry weight?  How about for the dry mass of Bus-1?  it was being de-classified as i checked last.  Also, I need.  1)  current orbital parameters of HST   2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.  3)  Discovery\'s  DRY weight  4) HST\'s Dry weight.    So how long do they need to train?  a year?  2 years?  somehow I think 2-3 moths should be adequate.   Also because they significantly lacked on-orbit EVA experience.   The HST is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.   There comes a time in every project, to kill the management.  They can if neccessary, re-schedule the  HST mission.  December is not a drop dead date, unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission.      I suspect, the BUS-1, may not have enough basic thrust for the HST re-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks,  or bigger thrusters.   My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not a contingency.  My understanding is the mission  needs both a new FOC  and work on the electrical system,  plus another re-boost.      Somehow, i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then $500 million.  and the extra stuff is real cheap.  NASA has lots of suits,  MMU\'s, and the EDO pallets are re-usable.  Oh, one double magnum of champagne, now there\'s a couple hundred bucks.      That door has cycled, X times already.  Once after massive G loading. I somehow think they can work ou-reliability  methods to ensure the door works.  Also,  please tell me how some sort of sublimated  material  like CO2, or H2O  would manage to contaminate the mirror,  anything that goes to vapor state, shouldn\'t adhere to the mirror.  somehow, the door,  problem can be worked.  maybe they can put a one time spring on it.  what do they do now, if the door hangs up.  that door is part of a intrument safing mechanism.  if it hangs up tomorrow,  it\'ll be 8 months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it.';2
228;'  Well, no, during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was not opened until after the Shuttle had landed.    I presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter with the orbiter bay doors shut- but still there would be lots of contamination worries.  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to  keep clean.  But I still don\'t know where the idea is coming from that HST _NEEDS_ a re-boost.  We have many problems but our orbit is the least of them.  There is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in December.';2
1105;'  Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers- they charge a fee.  Now, I\'m sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don\'t understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn\'t a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.   Integration, Dennis, isn\'t overhead.   Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.   When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isn\'t overhead. It is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort.   The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn\'t address the problems until the press published the story.  Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?   You should know Dennis that NASA doesn\'t include transport costs for resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.   I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.    Allen ';2

EDGAR PANGBORN  Davy Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states.  The church, for example, forbids that anyone produce, describe or use any substance containing... atoms.   PHILIP K. DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  Galactic Pot-Healer A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  A Maze of Death Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  VALIS The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  The Divine Invasion God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  The Handmaid\'s Tale A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it right again.  The book is the diary of a woman\'s life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women\'s right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed- sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood\'s writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  The Bible This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you\'ll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version.

A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism.  Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious area.  Argues both for negative atheism (i.e. the non-belief in the existence of god(s)) and also for positive atheism (the belief in the non-existence of god(s)).  Includes great refutations of the most challenging arguments for god- particular attention is paid to refuting contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne. 541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover- paperback also available)  The Case Against Christianity, Temple University Press A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately) demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent. 273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5  JAMES TURNER  Without God, Without Creed, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,  MD, USA Subtitled The Origins of Unbelief in America.  Examines the way in which unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England developments.  Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism, Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea, the belief that God exists.  316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4  GEORGE SELDES (Editor)  The great thoughts, Ballantine Books, New York, USA A dictionary of quotations of a different kind, concentrating on statements and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person\'s philosophy and world-view.  Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people.  For some popular observations, traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries.  Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff\'s What Great Men Think of Religion and Noyes\' Views of Religion. 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  The Existence of God (Revised Edition), Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of Theism (1977) and was concluded with Faith and Reason (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie\'s The Miracle of Theism.  In the revised edition of The Existence of God, Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  The Miracle of Theism, Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as replacements for God such as Lelie\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin\'s works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

I don\'t agree with it- now try proving, through #>#some objective moral test, that my disagreeing is incorrect. =) #>  #> Your claim, which you have deleted now was not universal => not objective. # #      I\'ve deleted it now, in the interest of brevity. Go back a step #and you\'ll see it was still in your post. Yes, that was my claim- if you #can refute it, then please do so.  Firstly, an apology.  You hadn\'t deleted your claim, and I was mistaken in saying you had. Sorry for any offence caused.  Secondly,  how can I refute your definition?  I can only point up its logical implications, and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other areas.  Indeed, by your definition, an objective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  I have no quibble with that belief, other than that it is useless, and that objective is a perfectly good word.  #> So, what *is* objective?  Not the age of the universe, anyway, as I show #> above. # #      How many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self- #consistent? I\'d be amazed if it was more than one. How many different #moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single #individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?  Begging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are saying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about it.  Why?  #      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be #emirically verified through means that\'ll give the same result no matter #who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the #largish side...).   This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality which doesn\'t depend on what we think.   Why should an extreme Biblical Creationist give a rat\'s ass about the means of which you speak?  #I\'ve heard of no way to verify morality in a #consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement- care to #enlighten me?  The same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  I wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value. If a moral system makes a prediction It will be better if..., that can be tested, and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction This drug will relieve pain...  #      People\'s *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective- #you can have any idea you like, and I can\'t stop you. Universae and #their ages is another ballgame- they are what they are, and if you #dislike some detail of them, that\'s a problem with your *opinion* of #them.   Sure.  Assume an objective reality, and you get statements like this.  #I claim that morality is an opinion of ours, and as such #subjective and individual. If I\'m wrong, then some more-or-less #objectively real thing exists, which you label objective morality- #can you back up this positive claim of existence?  Can you back up your positive claim above?  No.  That\'s because it\'s an assumption.  I make the same assumption about values, on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two, and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same.  #>#      Point: Morals are, in essence, personal opinions. Usually #>#(ideally) well-founded, motivated such, but nonetheless personal. The #>#fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question, #>#sometimes even for the same reason, does not make morals objective- it #>#makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question, #>#which can be good for the evolution of a social species. #>  #> And if a real large lot (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a  #> football on a desk, I\'m supposed to see a logical difference between the two?   #> Perhaps you can explain the difference to me, since you seem to see it #> so clearly. # #      Take a look on the desk - i.e., perform a test. If(football) THEN #(accept theory) ELSE DO (Tell people they\'re hallucinating). # #      Now take a look at morality. See anything? If so, please inform me #which way to look, and WHY to look that particular way, as opposed to #some other. Get my drift?  No. Just look.  Are you claiming never to know what good means?  #>#      *Science* is a whole other matter altogether. #>  #> Says you.  Prove that those who disagree are wrong? # #      That\'s a simple(?) matter of proving the track record of the #scientific method.  I think it\'s great, and should be applied to values.  I may be completely wrong, but that\'s what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought. ';0
1631;' Seems like a lot of trouble to go to. Its probably better to    invest in newer launch systems. I don\'t think a big cost advantage for using Russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years).  Lockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy  the Proton from them (they market the Proton world wide except Russia).  They should know a lot about the possibilities, I haven\'t heard them propose US launches, so I assume they looked into it and found it  unprofitable.    Yes...   Comparable to the Zenit I suppose, but since it looks like nothing will be built there, you might just as well pick any spot.  The message is: to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and Kazakstan are still cooperating. Later, the story may be different.';2

746;'In <lsjc8cINNmc1@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin)   I regard love as no more or less benign than any other Christian does. You are merely expressing approval of the consequences I find therein. Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my (or any) religion.  Love is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians can write both the gentle words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the conservatives will quote at you :-) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...  This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note, as will become more evident below.   blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though, given my principle that one CANNOT force one\'s own notion of sin on another, and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism, Russel Turpin and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love.   You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) God in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:  The possibility that always exists is that I (or, to revert to proper time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could persuade Christian B of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian] prohibitions.  What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:  \tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved \t    in the Inquisition.  \tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however \t    painful this *seems*, discipline her children for their \t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or \t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example \t    deterring others from the same loss-of-soul.)  \tA.  I point out that this justification of a failure in love \t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of \t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.  \tB.  Burns me at the stake.  My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is going on here has a *lot* to do with cultural baggage.  In this case, the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B.  Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\'s B, then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this- and in what- ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney.  So, one possibility fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others.  At the other extreme, the persuasion will succeed when it properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have accepted that they were in fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them.)  The point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition, against heresy, it is *bound* to break down in precisely the worst cases.  The conservative (I don\'t think that is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above, that he is justified in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a greater good.  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel, as if one\'s theories about sin entitled one to cast aside Jesus\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).  I am a radical Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.   Well, the whole *point* of making these the base commandments is that they *aren\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one\'s actions.  The Great Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  Conservatives may twist this act as if you were God to mean lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\'t keep YOUR rules. They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation against God by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the conservatives have confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.   And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged *different* ethical systems (or in some cases, none).  As a result, it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular (or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH. It does not have a QU\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very little, if anything, in the way of commandments -- so little that the Christians who desperately *want* commandments go mining for them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another.  \t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson \t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that \t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT- I\'ll \t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why \t there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved.]  You are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical system.  But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.   I think you are begging the question. Why don\'t I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity? [Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]';3

624;'  First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as  capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.    If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I  presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together.  As for the issues, let\'s start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact. However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless of what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That\'s my opinion, and I am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.  I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I  certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.    As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what you\'re talking about.  Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and  population control.  Could this be the atheist cause you were referring  to a few posts back? ';0

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups.  Many groups of a \'controversial\' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles:     1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers    2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism    3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)    4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument    5.

However, please send any changes or corrections to the author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism- it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network.                                   Finding Stuff  All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are some suggestions on what to do if you can\'t find them:  1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with    Alt.Atheism FAQ:.  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.     If you don\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\'t set up    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the    problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].    Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\'ll find the latest    versions of the FAQ files there.     FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you    need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with        send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq     in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article    Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these    sites- the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu    consisting of the following lines:        send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of    the following lines:        send atheism/faq/faq.txt       send atheism/faq/logic.txt       send atheism/faq/intro.txt       send atheism/faq/resource.txt     and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.    There\'s other stuff, too- interesting commands to try are help and    send atheism/index.  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the    newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this    if you\'ve tried the above methods and they\'ve failed- it\'s not nice to    clutter the newsgroup or people\'s mailboxes with requests for files.    it\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\'t have     FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files. ';0

Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle  ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure out how many, how often, where to, etc...)  Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to  eliminate designs that can\'t be built today.  And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.

It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS, ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be) ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.

Their latest model, the RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

1046;'(Book Review):                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North            Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed,            hardcover.                             THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to            most ALL astrophysical mysteries.                            This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged            edition of THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, 1959.             Volume I is NOTHING BUT MOTION (1979), and Volume II is            THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER (1988).                            Most books and journal articles on the subject of            astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial            differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by            contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except            for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.             Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical            agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual            validity.                            Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor            of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State            University.  He developed the Theory described in his books            while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the            properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements            they contain.                            THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION describes the astrophysical            portions of Larson\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE,            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of            grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and            astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two            postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of            space and time:                            (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME.                            (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                            From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a            COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the            concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with            translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-           vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including            EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959            book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES,            several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They            are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And            when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation            ready for those also.                            As a result of his theory, which he called THE            RECIPROCAL SYSTEM, Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists,            including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter,            quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure),            nuclear physics, general relativity, relativistic mass            increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in            stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be            nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very            critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles,            solutions in principle, no other way declarations, etc.,            used to maintain them.                            THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION is divided into 31 chapters.             It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from            the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters,            which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that            accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in            from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy            formation from the MYTHICAL big bang is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and            solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of            SINGLE stars.                            Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according            to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have            been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies            and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT            (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                            Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against            observations that contradict their theories would find            Larson\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an            OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY            BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the            plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray            telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from            ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any            visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional            coincidence).  Larson\'s explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER            HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the cosmic            sector.  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a            RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed            of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE            dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the            bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly            at random.                            Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from            books, journal articles, and leading physicists and            astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted            with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the            end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book            Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey, by William K. Hartmann,            says, Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if            we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars            form.... Unfortunately we cannot.  Larson\'s book contains            LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are            WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists,            astronomers, and astrophysicists.                   For more information, answers to your questions, etc.,            please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\'s BOOKS).                   UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this            IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED.  ';2
335;'Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight to the human being.  I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.  So, having seen Henry\'s encouraging statement about starting to talk about it- I shall.  I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent  as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and  probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world\'s space effort.  I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.  A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to  compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition, ideas for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration.  Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition, we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls of NASA and industry.  I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally eager to start this project.

Dan Schaertel\'s article [if I followed the quoting right]:     I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation `Rabbi\' seriously then Jesus had a full grasp of contemporary `scripture\'  Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...  Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.  Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:  Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, Mat26:54 that thus it must be?  Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples Mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.  If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture\' had not been accessible then it probably would be a different matter.';0

1019;'The following press release was distributed April 1 by NASA Headquarters.  Space Station Redesign Advisory Members Named  Along with Dr. Charles M. Vest, recently named by Vice President Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the Space Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives from government and industry and academic experts from across the country to participate in an independent review of the redesign options being developed by NASA.  I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this important review panel. America\'s future in science and technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost attention and care, said Vest. We have assembled a diverse panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical task.  The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA\'s redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space station international partners also are being asked to  participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory committee will submit its recommendations in June.

If nothing else, I know such liquids ARE possible because...  They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) in it.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down by tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.

730;'...  I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. They had advertised that they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room of the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to the lecture.  There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one woman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of them. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium Rosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read straight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he lacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy read, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars (English?) from the thirteenth century.  The other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a fairy-tale teller\'s voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to me. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something. What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, then that we couldn\'t become divine as the persons we are currently, but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I\'ve read too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your friends_ in _Prometheus rising_.   It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding the actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to be a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more distance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain power and admiration. He spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever he remembered. -)  The information brochure is at home. Should you want their address, please e-mail me. --Ceci ';3
442;' Perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is.  If we can\'t measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics aren\'t objective either.  That\'s what I mean when I say there\'s no objective physics.  Sure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that\'s maths.  It\'s only physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can\'t do that objectively, we\'re stuck.  (Of course, this displays my blatant bias towards applied science- but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real world situations, based on real world observations.)   It\'s an axiom that it\'s invariant.  But if the two of us measure it, we\'ll get different answers.  Yes, we call that experimental error, but it\'s not really error in the conventional sense- in fact, if you don\'t get any, that\'s an error :-)  You could argue that the value of c is objective, to within +/- <some value>.  But I\'d call that a rather odd usage of the word objective, and it opens the way for statements like Murder is objectively wrong for all people, to within 1\% of the total population. ';0

I\'m at a loss to imagine what you really do mean, though.         Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity\'s sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can have.        I\'m saying the Universe has a real age, because I see evidence for it- cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of people\'s opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results.         I can\'t see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations, see to it (s)he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be the same.         Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests (which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we conducted said tests in identical manner, no? They don\'t, which I take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.         Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean physical pain. You have a sharp point, I\'ll give you that- but you still haven\'t given me a way to quantify morality.         We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change- I hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable, producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.         Better and worse are (almost?) always defined in the context of a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within* *that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of good and bad- I wish you luck.         Isn\'t that what _you\'re_ doing, when assuming an objectively real morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my statement?         Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim- ponder different individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members of society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was objective, at least one should be way off base, but yet hir \'incorrect\' morality seems to function fine. How come?        As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick them from different societies- say, an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).  [ deletia - testing for footballs on desks ]         One thing is good under some circumstances, because we wish to achieve some goal, for some reason. Other times we wish to do something else, and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all.        Some things are hard to make good, because we\'d seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. Still, the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out.        I almost always know what good means- sometimes I even know why. I never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone, immutable.  [...]        Yes, me too, and I\'ve tried a thing or two down that line- it doesn\'t look good for objective values to me at all. ';0

I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.  As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:     1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO     2)  in LEO we don\'t get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get        that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts     3)  since we are going out there...why not piggy-back some general science     4)  the intercept problem is a lot easied over LONG distances and LONG times  I am sure there are some things I have forgotten, and some I haven\'t been told but, those are the reasons we all talk about.  --  ';2
152;'Has anyone written or seen a C library or C++ class for fixed-point math, or good articles about same?  I pretty much know how to do this, but I have a few other wheels to invent at the moment...  Thanks!';1
404;'  Uh, why do they have to ask a state commision? Unless the state\'s buying...  Such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company of selling different types of light, and will decreace the likleihood that they will do so. And any efficient lights they might have been planning in the future, go down the drain.....   You could order it special. If enough people did so, it would be  low cost. Last I checked, you could use UPS to buy stuff in Arizona before going there.  Finally, I\'m sure your state has things like small factories and machine shops. You could go into business making lights that are cheaper to use (thanks to their higher efficiency and the fact that they aren\'t wasting energy on broadcasting to space) and therefore _better_ than the old style...   Five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy will fall apart.     As if the clean air act really cleaned up the air...   _MY_ *experience* seems to suggest that you\'re trying too hard to *educate* them (with the same methods used in American schools to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as Proto-Ugric) instead of *selling* them on the idea.  ...  Well, wake up. Space is becoming a field of human endeavor instead of just something we can look at from a long long way away. There are practical space projects that could conceivably (although probably not) cause lots of light pollution, and  have been argued against on those grounds, even though they might open up such possibilities, that people could vacation on Mars if they wanted really dark skies...

1237;'   Bill says ...   I presume the one you refer to is Space Sailing by Jerome L. Wright.  He  worked on solar sails while at JPL and as CEO of General Astronautics.  I\'ll furnish ordering info upon request.  The Friedman book is called Starsailing: Solar Sails and Interstellar Travel. It was available from the Planetary Society a few years ago, I don\'t know if it still is.';2
