1332;thank for the etymology lesson but I actually know what orthodox mean you 're avoid my question however which be from what body of theology do your version of orthodoxy come you seem to simply be say that whatever   you   understand the Bible to say be orthodox you be obviously mistaken since many many people have read the Bible and many do not agree with you on this point once again Robert be your interpretation the only correct or orthodox one this whole string begin as a response to your attack on Mormonism- no one be attack your personal belief only your tendency to present they as orthodoxy I do n't much care   what   you believe about the Bible- just do n't present you personal understanding as the only orthodox one I have never attack your specific belief that 's   your   approach remember state that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other view be indeed proof that the Bible can be interpret many way which have be my whole point all along the specific of your belief be your business- just do n't pretend that they be anything more than your personal intepretation and be careful about cry heresy base on your private belief system;3

828;hi I 'm new to imaging and my advisor and I would like to do some 3d reconstruction we take slide biological and image they on a 486 then the software allow we to trace the outline of the object we want to save the outline be store as a TIFF file we would like to convert a group of these outline into a 3d image we be unsure as to where to begin someone mention that if we could convert the tiff into a vector format then we could view they in Autocad any help would be greatly appreciate;1
992;our group recently buy a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it we buy this thing because it 1 have a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal input and 2 claim to print 256 gray level image however the manual that come with it only describe how to format the parallel datum to print 1 and 4 bit   pixel image after some initial problem with the parallel interface I now have this thing run from a parallel port of an Hewlett Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit   pixel image just fine I call the Mitsubishi people and ask about the 256 level claim and they say that be only available when use with the video signal input this be not mention in the sale literature however they do say the P78U can do 6 bit   pixel 64 level image in parallel mode but they did n't have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call Japan etc frankly I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit   pixel image from the video source it ca n't store 8 bit   pixel in the memory It 's not like memory be that expensive any more if anybody have any information on get 6 bit   pixel or even 8 bit   pixel image out of this thing I would greatly appreciate your send it to I thank;1
67;and that of course be the point you ca n't simply divide the world into atheist and non atheist on the basis of god belief if all you care about be belief in a supernatural deity and have nothing to say about behaviour then belief in a supernatural being be your criterion but once you start talk about behaviour then someone 's suscept- ibility to be lead by bad people into do bad thing be what you be I assume worried about and in that area what you care about be whether someone be sceptical critical and autonomous on the one hand or gullible excitable and easily lead on the other I would say that a tendency to worship tyrant and ideology indicate that a person be easily lead whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seem to I to be beside the point;0

866;         note that a particular society in this case the mainland UK      have few religously motivate murder and few murder of   any       kind say very little about whether inter religion murder elsewhere      be religiously motivate        no but it allow one to conclude that there be nothing inherent     in all religion or for that matter in catholicism and protestantism     that motivate one to kill    Motivates or allow the Christian Bible say that one may kill   under certain circumstance in fact it instruct one to kill under   certain circumstance i 'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instruct they to kill under certain circumstance I do get your distinction between motivate and allow and I do agree that if a flavour of theism allows atoricitie then that be an indictment of that theism but it rather depend on what the certain circumstances be when you talk about Christianity or Islam then at least your claim can be understand It 's when people go to a general statement about theism that it fall apart one could believe in a God which instruct one to be utterly harmless      for my part I conclude that something     else be require I also happen to believe that that something     else will work no less well without religion any easy they   Us will     do    and what do religion supply if not an easy they   Us not necessarily Love thy neighbour do not supply a they   us it demolish it and my definition of religion be broad than my definition of theism as I have explain       by insist that even the murder of four labourer choose because      they be catholic and who have nothing to do with the IRA by      protestant extremist be   not   religously motivate I think what      you be say be that you simply will not accept   any   murder as      be religiously motivate        No what about that guy who cut off someone 's head because he believe     he be the devil incarnate that be religously motivated    what about the protestant extremist who kill four catholic   labourer that   was n't   religiously motivate not in my opinion if they be do it because of some obscure point of theology then yes but since all protestant do n't do this nor do they elect extremist to do it for they it 's just too broad too say religion do this I 'm say that the cause be far more complex than that take away the religious element and you 'd still have the powerful motive of revenge and misguided patriotism you know when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say stop the killing one might listen to that especially when you claim not to read mind       also the murder ensue from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie the inquisition     and the many religous war    What 's so special about these exception Is n't this all just a   grab bag of ad hoc excuse for not consider some other murder   to be religiously motivate What 's the general principle behind   all this the general principle be that it 's fairly clear to I at least that religion be the primary motivator enabler whatever of these It 's not nearly so obvious what be go on when one look at NI apart from violence of course       It 's not an abstract argument northern Irish Protestants say      we do n't want to be absorb into be officially catholic country          now what be we suppose to do be we suppose to reply no      that 's only what you think you do n't want Mr o'dwyer assure we      that no matter what you say you want you really want something      else        you think the Unionists would n't mind be absorb into a non catholic     country other than the UK of course It 's a terrible thing to lose     a mind maybe the word country be there for more than just kick     I certainly do n't believe that the Unionists be in it for God I think     they wish to maintain their position of privilege    i 'm still listen to what they say and you be still tell we   your version of what they think you read mind and I do n't You 've speculate on my motive often enough and you do n't take my statement of my own belief at face value therefore your claim not to read mind have no credibility with I sorry I also note that you fail to answer my question it just look to I very much like you have an axe to grind especially as you be indeed ignore what most protestant say which be stop the killing the people you refer to be properly describe as unionist not protestant    as for their position of privilege what be that if not religion-   base it be base on politic bigotry and heartless extremism none of these thing be synonymous with religion though there be certainly some overlap;0

Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe which he call the Reciprocal System be build on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe be compose ENTIRELY of one component MOTION exist in three dimension in DISCRETE unit and in two RECIPROCAL form SPACE and TIME 2 the physical universe conform to the relation of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematic its magnitude be ABSOLUTE and its geometry be EUCLIDEAN from these two postulate Larson develop a COMPLETE theoretical Universe use various combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational- rotational motion the concept of IN ward and OUT ward SCALAR MOTIONS and speed in relation to the Speed of Light which Larson call UNIT VELOCITY and the NATURAL DATUM at each step in the development Larson be able to MATCH object in his theoretical Universe with object in the REAL physical universe photon sub atomic particle   INCOMPLETE ATOMS   charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar ETC even object not yet discover then such as EXPLODING galaxy and GAMMA RAY BURSTS and apply his theory to his new model of the atom Larson be able to precisely and accurately calculate inter- atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of this be describe in good detail with OUT fancy complex mathematic in his book BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson the following be a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe some of the early book be out of print now but still available through inter library loan the Structure of the Physical Universe 1959 the case against the Nuclear Atom 1963 beyond Newton 1964 New Light on Space and Time 1965 Quasars and Pulsars 1971 nothing but MOTION 1979   a   9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the   8.3 billion Super Collider    the last four chapter explain chemical bonding   the Neglected Facts of Science 1982 the UNIVERSE of MOTION 1984   FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery   BASIC property of matter 1988 all but the last of these book be publish by North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland or 97213 and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library does n't have each of they several of they include the last one be available from the International Society of Unified Science ISUS 1680 E. Atkin Ave Salt Lake City Utah 84106 this be the organization that be start to promote Larson 's theory they have other related publication include the quarterly journal RECIPROCITY Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson be a retired engineer Chemical or Electrical he be about 91 year old when he die in May 1989 he have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University he develop his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical property base only on the element use Larson 's lack of a fancy ph.d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore he but it be not a VALID reason sometimes it take a relative outsider to CLEARLY see the forest through the TREES at the same time it be clear from his book that he also know ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction AD HOC assumption principle of IMPOTENCE IN CONSISTENCIES ETC Larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it be not necessary for he to do so he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational datum and in many case his explanation FIT BETTER a self consistent theory be much MORE than the ORTHODOX physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for a unified field theory that work but have be ignore one for over 30 year now modern physics do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of Larson 's book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that epicycle crystal sphere geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seem to explain it well but be later prove CONCEPTUALLY wrong Prof. Frank H. Meyer Professor Emeritus of UW Superior be   be a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson 's theory and be or still be President of Larson 's organization the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY of UNIFIED SCIENCE and Editor of their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY he move to Minneapolis after retire Super Collider BOONDOGGLE I be against contruction of the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas or anywhere else it would be a gross WASTE of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value Most physicist do n't realize it but accord to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson as describe in his book the strange GOOFY particle meson hyperon ALLEGED quark etc which they be find in existing collider Fermi Lab Cern etc be really just ATOMS of ANTI MATTER which be create by the high energy colliding beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment a large and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti matter that the physicist have not see there before and the physicist will be even more confuse than they be now be a few more type of anti matter atom worth the   8.3 billion cost do n't we have much more important use for this waste money another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in Texas have a serious and grow problem with some kind of fire ant eat the insulation off underground cable how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the Supercollider name the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as propose be TOTALLY ABSURD if it be build it should be name after a lead particle physicist LARSONIAN Anti Matter in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe anti matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it have more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which Larson call Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum in Larson 's theory a positron be actually a particle of MATTER not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in Larson 's theory the ANTI matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of TIME and only one dimension of space and exist in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half LARSONIAN Relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury have be observe and precisely measure to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 second of arc per century 531 second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet Venus Earth Jupiter etc the remain 43 second of arc be be use to help prove Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity but the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieve result close to the 43 second than General Relativity can by instead use SPECIAL relativity in one or more of his book he apply the LORENTZ transformation on the high orbital speed of Mercury Larson TOTALLY reject General Relativity as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY he also reject most of Special Relativity include the part about mass increase near the speed of light and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shift great than 1.000 REALLY be move fast than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from we in TIME in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure be the CLOCK time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be NEGLIGIBLE- but at high speed they become significant and the Lorentz Transformation must be use as a FUDGE FACTOR   Larson often use the term coordinate TIME when write about this   in regard to mass increase it have be prove in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration   FORCE   MASS a   F   m Orthodox physicist be ignore the THIRD factor FORCE in Larson 's theory mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drop toward zero FORCE be actually a motion or combination of motion or relation between motion include INward and OUTward SCALAR motion the expansion of the universe for example be an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so call Big Bang which be yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY the UNIVERSE of MOTION I wish to recommend to everyone the book the UNIVERSE of MOTION by Dewey B. Larson 1984 North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland Oregon 97213 456 page index hardcover it contain the astrophysical portion of a GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by that author an UNrecognized geniu more than thirty year ago it contain FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the FORMATION of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true ORIGIN of the 3 degree background radiation cosmic ray and gamma- ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf explode galaxy etc it contain what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the following be an example of his Theory 's success in his first book in 1959 the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE Larson predict the existence of EXPLODING galaxy several year before astronomer start find they they be a NECESSARY consequence of Larson 's comprehensive theory and when QUASARS be discover he have an immediate relate explanation for they also GAMMA RAY BURSTS Astro physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious GAMMA RAY BURSTS they be originally think to originate from neutron star in the disc of our galaxy but the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit have be detect they in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any known object except for a few case of directional coincidence Gamma ray burst be a NECESSARY consequence of the GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson accord to page 386 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION publish in 1984 the gamma ray burst be come from SUPERNOVA explosion in the ANTI matter HALF of the physical universe which Larson call the Cosmic Sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with known object and come from all direction uniformly I wonder how close to we in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the MASS extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby GAMMA RAY BURSTS LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of they but binary star system be actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson I will try to summarize Larsons explanation which be detail in chapter 7 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION and in some of his other book first of all accord to Larson star do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the COMPLETE annihilation of heavy element heavy than IRON each element have a destructive TEMPERATURE LIMIT the heavy the element be the low be this limit a star 's internal temperature increase as it grow in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of light and light element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of IRON there be a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION this be because there be so much iron present- and that be relate to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which Larson explain in some of his book   well than I can   when the star explode the light material on the outer portion of the star be blow outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavy material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expand OUTWARD in TIME which be equivalent to inward in SPACE and it often actually disappear for a while over long period of time both masse start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blow outward in space now start to form a red GIANT star the material that have be blow OUTWARD in TIME start to form a WHITE DWARF star both star then start move back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the H R Diagram the chance of the two masse fall back into the exact same location in space make a single lone star again be near zero they will instead form a BINARY system orbit each other accord to Larson a white dwarf star have an inverse DENSITY gradient be dense at its SURFACE because the material at its center be most widely disperse blow outward in time this eliminate the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL fantasy about degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc LARSONIAN Solar System Formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affect by its heat etc these will become PLANETS in chapter 7 of the UNIVERSE of MOTION Larson use all this information and other principle of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode 's Law Black Hole FANTASY I hear that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black hole merge together into a single black hole and conclude that the new black hole would have MORE mass than the sum of the two original black hole such a result should be recognize by everyone as a RED FLAG cause widespread doubt about the whole IDEA of black hole etc after read Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe especially his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION it be clear to I that black hole be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL fantasy the strange object at Cygnus X-1 be just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to prove their theory by the way I do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist Stephen Hawking the physicist and astronomer seem to be act as if Hawking 's severe physical problem somehow make he wise it do not I wish the same attention have be give to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he be still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to Larson 's theory book and organization the International Society of Unified Science ELECTRO MAGNETIC PROPULSION I hear of that concept many year ago in connection with UFO 's and unorthodox inventor but I never be able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct I find a possible clue about why they might work on page 112 113 of the book BASIC property of MATTER by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson which describe part of Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe I quote one paragraph as indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrive at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it be bring out in volume I   Larson 's book nothing but MOTION   that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorb by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited it follow that there be always a large excess of free electron in the material sector   material half   of the universe most of which be uncharged in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remain permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate be thus expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there be other process to be discuss later whereby electron be return to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilize at an equilibrium level note that in Larson 's theory UNcharged electron be also massLESS and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spin around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity be the speed of light and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light accord to Larson 's theory   I might have the above and below label mix up   Larson be say that outer space be fill with mass- LESS UN charge electron fly around at the speed of light if this be true then the ELECTRO MAGNETIC propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhaps give they a charge and mass and shoot they toward the rear to achieve propulsion in Larson 's theory an electrical charge be a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimpose on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confused meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud suppression of LARSONIAN Physics the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson have be available for more than 30 year publish in 1959 in his first book the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE it be TOTALLY UN SCIENTIFIC for Hawking Wheeler Sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call science or physic or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education system to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson 's theory have they have Larson 's theory have excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer such as gamma ray burst and the nature of quasar Larson 's theory deserve to be HONESTLY and openly discuss in the physics chemistry and astronomy journal in the U.S. and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of Larson 's theory should be include in all related course at UW EC UW Madison Cambridge Cornell University and elsewhere so that student be not keep in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they be be feed for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited source especially Larson 's BOOKS UN altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this important partial summary be ENCOURAGED;3

511;I ca n't see the need for a single big expensive heavy mothership except for Voyager style flyby mission a few year ago I do some calculation on a Grand Tour space probe launch by a Saturn v in 1975 76 at the time I feel that the idea of a big mother ship have some merit the Voyagers have to be rather small lightweight craft due to the limitation impose by use weak Titan III   Centaur launcher the concept I examine and Michael 's have a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society 's Daedalus project for send a probe to Barnard 's Star i.e. a large bus spacecraft carry several small probe to be dispatch when the ship arrive at its destination the Saturn v supposedly would have be able to launch a 10 ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond the bus could have include far more powerful camera   telescope   scientific equipment and a heavy   more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitation on weight anymore extremely important as the Voyagers have to perform most of their measurement within a couple of week before and after planetary encounter and usually at a relatively great distance the small probe carry aboard might have be base on the real Voyagers and an even small version like the one schedule for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century and would have be release at various point during the mission the advantage be obvious the bus would have carry out the same basic Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune mission than Voyager 2 do but in addition two sub probe could have be relase at Saturn examine that planet 's south polar region before move on to Pluto this would have enable NASA to map both hemisphere of Pluto   Charon by 1986 and several other probe could have examine part of the Jupiter   Saturn   Uranus   Neptune system that were n't examine in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory relate factor a small swarm of camera equip miniature space probe release a month before encounter would have be too costly for a small Voyager type mission but entirely feasible if launch from a heavy well equip spacecraft and would we have learn a lot more about the outer planet the reason why the Grand Tour be cancel be lack of money of course marcu;2

467;the number of civilian iraqi death be way over exaggerate and exploit for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news medium the fact be that less Iraqis die in the Gulf War than do civilian in any other war of comparable size this century this be due mostly to the short duration couple with precise surgical bombing technique which be technically possible only recently the idea that hundred of thousand of iraqi citizen die be ludicrous not even hundred of thousand of iraqi soldier die and they be the one be target or do you think that the US and its ally be specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilian either the smart bomb did n't hit their target and we know they do or they be target civilian target which be hardly condusive to destroy iraq 's military potential the military mission planner be not fool they know they have to hit   military   target to win a war hit civilian target do nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one want the people to rise up against their tyrant dictator how about all the innocent people who die in blanket bombing in WW2 I do n't hear you bemoan they War be never an exact science but with smart bomb it 's become more exact with a small percentage of civilian casualty sometimes mistake be made- target be misidentified- innocent die That 's war the way it really be but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictator to treat the earth like it 's one big rummage sale grab everything they can get be bad like Patrick Henry say some 217 year ago I know not what course other may take but as for I give I liberty or give I death War be always the price one must be willing to pay if one wish to stay free Mathew your sarcasm be note but you be completely off base here you come off sound like a complete peace nik idiot although I feel sure that be not your intent so the iraqi war be wrong eh I 'm sure that appeasement would have work well than war just like it do in WW2 eh I guess we should n't have fight WW2 either just think of all those innocent german civilian kill in Dresden and Hamburg how about all the poor French who die in the crossfire because we invade the continent we should have just let Hitler take over Europe and you 'd be speak German instead of English right now tyrant like Hussein   have   to be stop his kind do n't understand diplomacy- they only understand the point of a gun my only regret be that Bush wimpe out and did n't have the military roll into Baghdad so now Hussein be still in power and the iraqi people 's sacrifice not to mention the 357 Americans who die be for naught Liberating Kuwait be a good thing but wipe Hussein off the map would 've be well and as for poor poor Rodney King do you ever stop and think   why   the jury in the first trial bring back a verdict of not guilty those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no far than the video tape but the jury look at   all   the evidence evidence which you and I have not see when one make a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be present on both side one have simply lower himself to the level of vigilante justice a state of mind which your sarcasm above seemingly speak against but instead tend to support in the case against the policeman Law in this country be intend to protect the right of the accuse whether they be criminal or cop one be not find guilty if there be a reasonable doubt of one 's guilt and only the jury be in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict anyone else be simply succumb to verbal vigilantism regard;0

1883;archive name atheism   introduction alt atheism archive name introduction last modify 5 April 1993 version 1.2 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED message----- an introduction to atheism by mathew   mathewmantis.co.uk   this article attempt to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst I have try to be as neutral as possible regard contentious issue you should always remember that this document represent only one viewpoint I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions- some relevant book be list in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have present this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the question ask by the imaginary theist be question which have be crop up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup be create some other frequently ask question be answer in a companion article please note that this article be arguably slant towards answer question pose from a christian viewpoint this be because the FAQ file reflect question which have actually be ask and it be predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism so when I talk of religion I be talk primarily about religion such as Christianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine be much of the discussion will apply to other religion but some of it may not what be atheism atheism be characterize by an absence of belief in the existence of God some atheist go far and believe that God do not exist the former be often refer to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism it be important to note the difference between these two position weak atheism be simple scepticism- disbelief in the existence of God strong atheism be a positive belief that God do not exist please do not fall into the trap of assume that all atheist be strong atheist some atheist believe in the non existence of all Gods- other limit their atheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than make flat out denial but is n't disbelieve in God the same thing as believe he does n't exist definitely not Disbelief in a proposition mean that one do not believe it to be true not believe that something be true be not equivalent to believe that it be false- one may simply have no idea whether it be true or not which bring we to agnosticism what be agnosticism then the term agnosticism be coin by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 he define an agnostic as someone who disclaim strong atheism and believe that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic be someone who believe that we do not and can not know for sure whether God exist word be slippery thing and language be inexact beware of assume that you can work out someone 's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when refer to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist have so many shade of meaning it be very difficult to generalize about atheist about all you can say for sure be that atheist do n't believe in God for example it certainly is n't the case that all atheist believe that science be the good way to find out about the universe so what be the philosophical justification or basis for atheism there be many philosophical justification for atheism to find out why a particular person choose to be an atheist it 's good to ask she many atheist feel that the idea of God as present by the major religion be essentially self contradictory and that it be logically impossible that such a God could exist other be atheist through scepticism because they see no evidence that God exist but is n't it impossible to prove the non existence of something there be many counter example to such a statement for example it be quite simple to prove that there do not exist a prime number large than all other prime number of course this deal with well define object obey well define rule whether Gods or universe be similarly well define be a matter for debate however assume for the moment that the existence of a God be not provably impossible there be still subtle reason for assume the non existence of God if we assume that something do not exist it be always possible to show that this assumption be invalid by find a single counter example if on the other hand we assume that something do exist and if the thing in question be not provably impossible show that the assumption be invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a thing might be find to show that it is n't there such an exhaustive search be often impractical or impossible there be no such problem with large prime because we can prove that they do n't exist therefore it be generally accept that we must assume thing do not exist unless we have evidence that they do even theist follow this rule most of the time- they do n't believe in unicorn even though they ca n't conclusively prove that no unicorn exist anywhere to assume that God exist be to make an assumption which probably can not be test we can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he does n't exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assume by default that God do not exist since that be an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists- instead they generally restrict their claim so as to cover variety of God describe by follower of various religion so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exist it may be possible to prove that say a God as describe by a particular religious book do not exist it may even be possible to prove that no God describe by any present day religion exist in practice believe that no God describe by any religion exist be very close to believe that no God exist however it be sufficiently different that counter argument base on the impossibility of disprove every kind of God be not really applicable but what if God be essentially non detectable if God interact with our universe in any way the effect of his interaction must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable if God be essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he do not interact with our universe in any way many atheist would argue that if God do not interact with our universe at all it be of no importance whether he exist or not if the Bible be to be believe God be easily detectable by the Israelites surely he should still be detectable today note that I be not demand that God interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect cause by his presence though- otherwise how can I distinguish he from all the other thing that do n't exist ok you may think there 's a philosophical justification for atheism but is n't it still a religious belief one of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion be the redefinition game the cynical view of this game be as follow Person A begin by make a contentious statement when person b point out that it ca n't be true person a gradually re define the word he use in the statement until he arrive at something person b be prepared to accept he then record the statement along with the fact that person b have agree to it and continue eventually a use the statement as an agree fact but use his original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally need to get b to agree to it rather than be see to be apparently inconsistent B will tend to play along the point of this digression be that the answer to the question is n't atheism a religious belief depend crucially upon what be mean by religious Religion be generally characterize by belief in a superhuman control power especially in some sort of God and by faith and worship   It 's worth point out in pass that some variety of Buddhism be not religion accord to such a definition   atheism be certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor be it categorize by worship in any meaningful sense widen the definition of religious to encompass atheism tend to result in many other aspect of human behaviour suddenly become class as religious as well such as science politic and watch tv ok so it be not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science be still just an act of faith like religion be firstly it be not entirely clear that sceptical atheism be something one actually believe in secondly it be necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory datum we experience Most atheist try to adopt as few core belief as possible- and even those be subject to question if experience throw they into doubt Science have a number of core assumption for example it be generally assume that the law of physic be the same for all observer these be the sort of core assumption atheist make if such basic idea be call act of faith then almost everything we know must be say to be base on act of faith and the term lose its meaning Faith be more often use to refer to complete certain belief in something accord to such a definition atheism and science be certainly not act of faith of course individual atheist or scientist can be as dogmatic as religious follower when claim that something be certain this be not a general tendency however- there be many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exist Faith be also use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly does n't fit that definition as sceptical atheism have no belief strong atheism be close but still does n't really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental datum or the lack of it when assert that God do not exist if atheism be not religious surely it 's anti religious it be an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy the truth be not so clear cut atheism be the position that run logically counter to theism- in that sense it can be say to be anti religion however when religious believer speak of atheist be anti religious they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theist this categorization of atheist as hostile towards religion be quite unfair atheist attitude towards theist in fact cover a broad spectrum Most atheist take a live and let live attitude unless question they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friend of course this may be in part because atheism be not socially acceptable in many country a few atheist be quite anti religious and may even try to convert other when possible historically such anti religious atheist have make little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc country to digress slightly the Soviet Union be originally dedicate to separation of church and state just like the USA soviet citizen be legally free to worship as they wish the institution of state atheism come about when Stalin take control of the Soviet Union and try to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the population some atheist be quite vocal about their belief but only where they see religion encroach on matter which be not its business for example the government of the USA such individual be usually concerned that church and state should remain separate but if you do n't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely that be the same as state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state be that the state shall not legislate concern matter of religious belief in particular it mean not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it can not promote any belief which be religious in nature religion can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matter for example religious believer have historically be responsible for encourage many political reform even today many organization campaign for an increase in spending on foreign aid be found as religious campaign so long as they campaign concern secular matter and so long as they do not discriminate on religious ground most atheist be quite happy to see they have their say what about prayer in school if there 's no God why do you care if people pray because people who do pray be voter and lawmaker and tend to do thing that those who do n't pray ca n't just ignore also christian prayer in school be intimidate to non Christians even if they be tell that they need not join in the diversity of religious and non religious belief mean that it be impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non prayer tend to have friend and family who pray it be reasonable to care about friend and family waste their time even without other motive you mention Christians who campaign for increase foreign aid what about atheist why are n't there any atheist charity or hospital Do n't atheist object to the religious charity there be many charity without religious purpose that atheist can contribute to some atheist contribute to religious charity as well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheist even do voluntary work for charity found on a theistic basis Most atheist seem to feel that atheism is n't worth shout about in connection with charity to they atheism be just a simple obvious everyday matter and so be charity many feel that it 's somewhat cheap not to say self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious belief to weak atheist build a hospital to say I do not believe in God be a rather strange idea- it 's rather like hold a party to say today be not my birthday why the fuss atheism be rarely evangelical you say atheism is n't anti religious but be it perhaps a backlash against one 's upbringing a way of rebel perhaps it be for some but many people have parent who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist idea upon they and many of those people choose to call themselves atheist It 's also doubtless the case that some religious people choose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of be different on the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conform to the expectation of other on the whole we ca n't conclude much about whether atheism or religion be backlash or conformism- although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently how do atheist differ from religious people they do n't believe in God That be all there be to it atheist may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem even if they know the word they may wear hawaiian shirt they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robe many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God some atheist even carry a copy of the Bible around for argue against of course whoever you be the chance be you have meet several atheist without realise it atheist be usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance Unexceptional but are n't atheist less moral than religious people that depend if you define morality as obedience to God then of course atheist be less moral as they do n't obey any God but usually when one talk of morality one talk of what be acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society human be social animal and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other this be a good enough reason to discourage most atheist from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purpose of self preservation many atheist behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other human so why do they care what happen to other they do n't know they simply be that way naturally there be some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their action however there be equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious belief to justify their action for example here be a trustworthy saying that deserve full acceptance Jesus Christ come into the world to save sinner but for that very reason I be show mercy so that in I Jesus Christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in he and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only God be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote be from a statement make to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee Wisconsin it seem that for every atheist mass murderer there be a religious mass murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conduct by the Roper Organization find that behavior deteriorate after bear again experience while only 4 of respondent say they have drive intoxicate before be bear again 12 have do so after conversion similarly 5 have use illegal drug before conversion 9 after two percent admit to engage in illicit sex before salvation- 5 after   Freethought Today September 1991 p. 12   so it seem that at good religion do not have a monopoly on moral behaviour be there such a thing as atheist morality if you mean be there such a thing as morality for atheist then the answer be yes as explain above many atheist have idea about morality which be at least as strong as those hold by religious people if you mean do atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer be no atheism by itself do not imply anything much about how a person will behave Most atheist follow many of the same moral rule as theist but for different reason atheist view morality as something create by human accord to the way human feel the world ought to work rather than see it as a set of rule decree by a supernatural being then are n't atheist just theist who be deny God a study by the Freedom from Religion Foundation find that over 90 of the atheist who respond become atheist because religion do not work for they they have find that religious belief be fundamentally incompatible with what they observe around they atheist be not unbeliever through ignorance or denial- they be unbeliever through choice the vast majority of they have spend time study one or more religion sometimes in very great depth they have make a careful and consider decision to reject religious belief this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual 's personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism be often the only one that make sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make but do n't atheist want to believe in God atheist live their life as though there be nobody watch over they many of they have no desire to be watch over no matter how good natured the Big Brother figure might be some atheist would like to be able to believe in God but so what should one believe thing merely because one want they to be true the risk of such an approach should be obvious atheist often decide that want to believe something be not enough- there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of God they be unwilling in their soul to see many if not most atheist be previously religious as have be explain above the vast majority have seriously consider the possibility that God exist many atheist have spend time in prayer try to reach God of course it be true that some atheist lack an open mind- but assume that all atheist be biased and insincere be offensive and closed minded comment such as of course God be there you just are n't look properly be likely to be view as patronize certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it be vital that you give they the benefit of the doubt and assume that they be be sincere if they say that they have search for God if you be not willing to believe that they be basically tell the truth debate be futile Is n't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist many atheist live a purposeful life they decide what they think give meaning to life and they pursue those goal they try to make their life count not by wish for eternal life but by have an influence on other people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leave his mark on history it be a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random event however it be by no mean obvious that life be the sort of thing that have a meaning to put it another way not everything which look like a question be actually a sensible thing to ask some atheist believe that ask what be the meaning of life be as silly as ask what be the meaning of a cup of coffee they believe that life have no purpose or meaning it just be so how do atheist find comfort in time of danger there be many way of obtain comfort- from family friend or even pet or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individual believe in thing because they be comfort or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it 's a decision for the individual concern Most atheist be unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make they feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if search for truth sometimes make they feel unhappy that be just hard luck do n't atheist worry that they might suddenly be show to be wrong the short answer be no do you many atheist have be atheist for year they have encounter many argument and much suppose evidence for the existence of God but they have find all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousand of year of religious belief have n't result in any good proof of the existence of God atheist therefore tend to feel that they be unlikely to be prove wrong in the immediate future and they stop worry about it so why should theist question their belief do n't the same argument apply no because the belief be question be not similar weak atheism be the sceptical default position to take- it assert nothing strong atheism be a negative belief Theism be a very strong positive belief Atheists sometimes also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believer but to everyone else what sort of harm Religion represent a huge financial and work burden on mankind It be not just a matter of religious believer waste their money on church buildings- think of all the time and effort spend building church pray and so on imagine how that effort could be well spend many theist believe in miracle healing there have be plenty of instance of ill people be heal by a priest cease to take the medicine prescribe to they by doctor and die as a result some theist have die because they have refuse blood transfusion on religious ground it be arguable that the Catholic Church 's opposition to birth control and condom in particular be increase the problem of overpopulation in many third world country and contribute to the spread of AIDS world wide religious believer have be know to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of a different religion those were n't real believer they just claim to be believer as some sort of excuse what make a real believer there be so many one True Religions it 's hard to tell look at christianity there be many compete group all convince that they be the only true Christians sometimes they even fight and kill each other how be an atheist suppose to decide who 's a real Christian and who is n't when even the major christian church like the Catholic Church and the Church of England ca n't decide amongst themselves in the end most atheist take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who call himself a Christian and use christian belief or dogma to justify his action should be consider a Christian maybe some of those Christians be just pervert Christian teaching for their own end but surely if the Bible can be so readily use to support un christian act it ca n't be much of a moral code if the Bible be the word of God why could n't he have make it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your belief are n't a perversion of what your God intend if there be no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so sorry but if someone claim that he believe in Jesus and that he murder other because Jesus and the Bible tell he to do so we must call he a Christian obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question but since nobody have ever prove that God do not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious belief share by all faith be nonsense that do not hold because as be point out at the start of this dialogue positive assertion concern the existence of entity be inherently much hard to disprove than negative one nobody have ever prove that unicorn do n't exist but that does n't make it unlikely that they be myth it be therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it be to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheist would argue that assert nothing be well still well if atheism be so great why be there so many theist unfortunately the popularity of a belief have little to do with how correct it be or whether it works- consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo sciences many atheist feel that it be simply a human weakness to want to believe in god certainly in many primitive human society religion allow the people to deal with phenomenon that they do not adequately understand of course there 's more to religion than that in the industrialized world we find people believe in religious explanation of phenomenon even when there be perfectly adequate natural explanation Religion may have start as a means of attempt to explain the world but nowadays it serve other purpose as well but so many culture have develop religion surely that must say something not really Most religion be only superficially similar- for example it 's worth remember that religion such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the christian sense of course most religion be quick to denounce compete religion so it 's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famous scientist and philosopher who have conclude that God exist for every scientist or philosopher who believe in a god there be one who do not besides as have already be point out the truth of a belief be not determine by how many people believe it also it be important to realize that atheist do not view famous scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religious leader a famous scientist be only human- she may be an expert in some field but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight many respected scientist have make themselves look foolish by speak on subject which lie outside their field of expertise so be you really say that widespread belief in religion indicate nothing not entirely it certainly indicate that the religion in question have property which have help it so spread so far the theory of memetic talk of meme set of idea which can propagate themselves between human mind by analogy with gene some atheist view religion as set of particularly successful parasitic meme which spread by encourage their host to convert other some meme avoid destruction by discourage believer from question doctrine or by use peer pressure to keep one time believer from admit that they be mistaken some religious meme even encourage their host to destroy host control by other meme of course in the memetic view there be no particular virtue associate with successful propagation of a meme Religion be not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease be a good thing because of the number of people who have catch it even if religion be not entirely true at least it put across important message what be the fundamental message of atheism there be many important idea atheist promote the follow be just a few of them- do n't be surprised to see idea which be also present in some religion there be more to moral behaviour than mindlessly follow rule be especially sceptical of positive claim if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it be up to you to find it search for what be true even if it make you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it 's probably the only one you 'll have It 's no good rely on some external power to change you- you must change yourself just because something 's popular does n't mean it 's good if you must assume something assume something it 's easy to test do n't believe thing just because you want they to be true and finally and most importantly all belief should be open to question thank for take the time to read this article mathew -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version 2.2

answer but it 's couch in NASA jargon I 'll try to interpret 1)twe wait until the Shuttle clear the tower before roll 2)tThen we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack tbetween the wind

correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember tvelocity be a vector quantity make of both speed and direction tthe Shuttle have to have a large horizontal component to its tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all beg the question why is n't the launch pad orient to give this nice attitude to begin with why do the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer be that the pad be leftover from the Apollo day the Shuttle straddle two flame trench one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust you can see the effect of this on any daytime launch the SRM exhaust be dirty gray garbage and the SSME exhaust be fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top   orbiter side   and the bottom

guidance instruction from the ground stop reach the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the onboard computer take control however there turn out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly go off course so the Range Safety Officer destroy it although the bug be sometimes claim to have be an incorrect FORTRAN do statement it be actually a transcription error in which the bar indicate smoothing be omit from the expression r dot bar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative of radius this error lead the software to treat normal minor variation of velocity as if they be serious lead to incorrect compensation MARINER 2 become the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December of 1962 and it return information which confirm that Venus be a very hot 800 degree Fahrenheit now revise to 900 degree F. world with a cloud cover atmosphere compose primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid be later confirm in 1978 MARINER 3 launch on November 5 1964 be lose when its protective shroud fail to eject as the craft be place into interplanetary space unable to collect the Sun 's energy for power from its solar panel the probe soon die when its battery run out and be now in solar orbit it be intend for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4 MARINER 4 the sister probe to MARINER 3 do reach Mars in 1965 and take the first close up image of the martian surface 22 in all as it fly by the planet the probe find a cratered world with an atmosphere much thin than previously think many scientist conclude from this preliminary scan that Mars be a dead world in both the geological and biological sense MARINER 5 be send to Venus in 1967 it reconfirm the datum on that planet collect five year early by MARINER 2 plus the information that Venus atmospheric pressure at its surface be at least 90 time that of Earth 's or the equivalent of be 3,300 foot under the surface of an ocean MARINER 6 and 7 be send to Mars in 1969 and expand upon the work do by MARINER 4 four year early however they fail to take away the concept of Mars as a dead planet first make from the basic measurement of MARINER 4 MARINER 8 end up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot fail MARINER 9 the sister probe to MARINER 8 become the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971 it return information on the Red Planet that no other probe have do before reveal huge volcano on the martian surface as well as giant canyon system and evidence that water once flow across the planet the probe also take the first detailed closeup image of Mars two small moon Phobos and Deimos MARINER 10 use Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974 the probe do return the first close up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet reveal previously unseen detail in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in four Earth day MARINER 10 eventually make three flyby of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before run out of attitude control gas the probe reveal Mercury as a heavily cratere world with a mass much great than think this would seem to indicate that Mercury have an iron core which make up 75 percent of the entire planet PIONEER MOON SUN VENUS JUPITER and SATURN FLYBYS and orbiter PIONEER 1 through 3 fail to meet their main objective to photograph the Moon close up but they do reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth and the Moon include new datum on the Van Allen radiation belt circle Earth all three craft have failure with their rocket launcher PIONEER 1 be launch on October 11 1958 PIONEER 2 on November 8 and PIONEER 3 on December 6 PIONEER 4 be a Moon probe which miss the Moon and become the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959 PIONEER 5 be originally design to flyby

battery fail RANGER LUNAR LANDER and IMPACT MISSIONS RANGER 1 and 2 be test probe for the ranger lunar impact series they be mean for high Earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problem leave they in useless low orbit which quickly decay RANGER 3 launch on January 26 1962 be intend to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon but problem during the launch cause the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit ranger 3 do try to take some image of the Moon as it fly by but the camera be unfortunately aim at deep space during the attempt RANGER 4 launch April 23 1962 have the same purpose as RANGER 3 but suffer technical problem enroute and crash on the lunar farside the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon albeit without return datum RANGER 5 launch October 18 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4 lose all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually miss the Moon and drift off into solar orbit ranger 6 through 9 have more modify lunar mission they be to send back live image of the lunar surface as they head towards an impact with the Moon ranger 6 fail this objective in 1964 when its camera do not operate ranger 7 through 9 perform well become the first U.S. lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through 1965 LUNAR ORBITER LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 be design to orbit the Moon and image various site be study as land area for the manned APOLLO mission of 1969 1972 the probe also contribute greatly to our understanding of lunar surface feature particularly the lunar farside all five probe of the series launch from 1966 to 1967 be essentially successful in their mission they be the first U.S. probe to orbit the Moon all lo be eventually crash into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO mission SURVEYOR lunar soft LANDERS the SURVEYOR series be design primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sink into the soil before this time it be fear by some that the Moon be cover in great layer of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle SURVEYOR be successful in prove that the lunar surface be strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968 only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 be unsuccessful mission the rest become the first U.S. probe to soft land on the Moon take thousand of image and scoop the soil for analysis APOLLO 12 land 600 foot from SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and return part of the craft to Earth SURVEYOR 7 the last of the series be a purely scientific mission which explore the Tycho crater region in 1968 VIKING MARS orbiter and LANDERS vike 1 be launch from Cape Canaveral Florida on August 20 1975 on a titan 3e CENTAUR d1 rocket the probe go into martian orbit on June 19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slope of Chryse Planitia on July 20 1976 it soon begin its program search for Martian micro organism there be still debate as to whether the probe find life there or not and send back incredible color panorama of its surrounding one thing scientist learn be that Mars sky be pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally think the sky be pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust particle in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulder stretch out as far as its camera could image the VIKING 1 orbiter keep function until August 7 1980 when it run out of attitude control propellant the lander be switch into a weather report mode where it have be hope it would keep function through 1994- but after November 13 1982 an errant command have be send to the lander accidentally tell it to shut down until further order communication be never regain again despite the engineers effort through May of 1983 an interesting side note vike 1 's lander have be designate the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. be entrust with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until it can be attach to the lander by a manned expedition vike 2 be launch on September 9 1975 and arrive in martian orbit on August 7 1976 the lander touch down on September 3 1976 in Utopia Planitia it accomplish essentially the same task as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer work record one marsquake the orbiter have a series of attitude control gas leak in 1978 which prompt it be shut down that July the lander be shut down on April 12 1980 the orbit of both viking orbiter should decay around 2025 VOYAGER outer PLANET FLYBYS VOYAGER 1 be launch September 5 1977 and fly

towards Pluto but JPL opt for the sure thing of a Titan close up between the two probe our knowledge of the 4 giant planet their satellite and their ring have become immense VOYAGER 12 discover that Jupiter have complicate atmospheric dynamic lightning and aurorae three new satellite be discover two of the major surprise be that Jupiter have ring and that Io have active sulfurous volcano with major effect on the Jovian magnetosphere when the two probe reach Saturn they discover over 1000 ringlet and 7 satellite include the predict shepherd satellite that keep the ring stable the weather be tame compare with Jupiter massive jet stream with minimal variance a 33 year great white spot   band cycle be know Titan 's atmosphere be smoggy Mimas appearance be startling one massive impact crater give it the Death Star appearance the big surprise here be the stranger aspect of the ring braid kink and spoke be both unexpected and difficult to explain VOYAGER 2 thank to heroic engineering and programming effort continue the mission to Uranus and Neptune Uranus itself be highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity be that its magnetic axis be find to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis give Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channel be find on Ariel and Miranda be a bizarre patchwork of different terrain 10 satellite and one more ring be discover in contrast to Uranus Neptune be find to have rather active weather include numerous cloud feature the ring arc turn out to be bright patch on one ring two other ring and 6 other satellite be discover Neptune 's magnetic axis be also skew Triton have a canteloupe appearance and geyser What 's liquid at 38 K the two voyager be expect to last for about two more decade their on target journeying give

particular space mission and periodical source on space probe this list be by no means complete- it be primarily design to give you place to start your research through generally available work on the subject if anyone can add pertinent work to the list it would be greatly appreciate though naturally I recommend all the book list below I think it would be good if you start out with the general overview book in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area I also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general work on astronomy and the Sol system to give you some extra background Most of these book and periodical can be find in any good public and university library some of the more recently publish work can also be purchase in andor order

Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn Love be the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame this be in any case rather to the side of what I be attempt to raise in my note as will become more evident below blechhh I think you be misread I rather seriously though give my principle that one CANNOT force one 's own notion of sin on another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism Russel Turpin and other believer and unbeliever alike be under no threat of my legislate my own understanding of christian love you misread I can do and have repeatedly do a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibit in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it have do to human being in the first place and to respect for let alone love of God in near succession please go back to my quote word above the possibility that always exist be that I or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessor over the last several century could persuade Christian B of my case that the inquisition   do   indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love I must also note that the majority of Christians have be so persuade by christian argumentation as well as by secular   both christian and non christian   prohibition what Mr. Turpin allude to be a tricky point ta I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involve t in the Inquisition tB. the Inquisitor respond that Mother Church must however t painful this   seem   discipline her child for their t own good in this case the salvation of their soul or t if the torture heretic will not recant than by bad example t deter other from the same loss of soul ta I point out that this justification of a failure in love t depend on a highly speculative construal of text and of t philosophical assertion that be quite undemonstrable tb burn I at the stake my rhetoric have fail but the point I be make be sustain what be go on here have a   lot   to do with cultural baggage in this case the baggage include a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accuse person must prove innocence and that testimony be most believable if take under torture the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those place where it   have   be eliminate or at least greatly reduce have very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B. Mr. Turpin be point out that if I be a versus the Grand Inquisitor 's b then my persuasion be not very likely to work I know this- and in what- ever personal agony I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney so one possibility fail in this case as it will fail in may other at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it properly should not if it entail mistaken assumption I share with the Inquisitor and that be potentially an even more troubling case in that many of the victim of inquisition will have accept that they be in fact sinful in such random case as they may actually have be guilty of charge bring against they the point be that the persuasion break down when the party do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and give the main thrust of the inquisition against heresy it be   bind   to break down in precisely the bad case the conservative I do n't think that be the right word BTW will take refuge in what I attribute to B above that he be justify in cause harm because he   think   that work to a great good but this be a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel as if one 's theory about sin entitle one to cast aside Jesus word on deal with sinner cf Matthew 5:39ff I be a radical Christian   only   in that I take the gospel seriously well the whole   point   of make these the base commandment be that they   are n't   reducible to rule a set of rule be a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act such thing can be very helpful to individual or society but not if they be use   instead   of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's action the Great Commandment be more than anything else a call to act   as if you be God and accept ultimate responsibility   in your every action a demand that I like most would rather   not   hear but it keep pop up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it be more important that I be open to try this than succeed at it conservative may twist this act as if you be God to mean lay down rule for other people and be as nasty to they as possible if they do n't keep your rule they be so insistent and obvious about this that they have convince a lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy be how God act that after all be the standard accusation against God by the atheist here and elsewhere that the conservative have confuse their manipulative hoop jump notion of coerce other people with the Nature of God be almost the entire content of standard american atheism and I quite agree with it on this point and different body of Christians have from the beginning urge   different   ethical system or in some case none as a result it be bizarre to identify any one of these system however popular or infamous with Christianity Christianity do not have a TORAH it do not have a qu'ran specifically christian scripture have very little if anything in the way of commandment so little that the Christians who desperately   want   commandment go mine for they with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their effort the one single thing in the gospel which Jesus specifically give as a commandment to we be love one another ti will be expand on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson t that I hope to get to in a day or so it be quite true that t some Christians infer lots of commandment from the NT- i 'll t point out what have to be go on in these inference and why t there be a huge amount of cultural baggage involve   you be quite right that this be goo if one be look for an ethical system but why should anyone be look for an ethical system since our society be eager to hand we one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical system in which case I will profer the   agapate allelou   once again I think you be beg the question why do n't I and the myriad of other Christians like I tell you something about Christianity   nor be this very new in Christianity you might want to look up the origin and fundamental doctrine of the Quakers from the 17th century onwards and they be not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that be congenial to my case  ;3

848;well it 's be a while since this be discuss so I take the liberty of reprint without permission so sue I Eric Haines reprint of the very interesting discussion of this topic jonas o   o X snip snip X o   o give a man a fish and he 'll eat one day give a man a fishing rod and he 'll laze around fishing and never do anything with that in mind I reprint without permission so sue I relevant information post some year ago on this very problem note the early use of PostScript technology predate many of this year 's paper list in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement post here a few day ago Eric Intersection between a line and a Polygon UNDECIDABLE tby Dave Baraff Tom Duff tFrom debcharisma.graphics.cornell.edu tnewsgroup comp.graphic tkeyword p NP Jordan curve separation Ursyhon Metrization Theorem torganization Program of Computer Graphics I think that this be a very difficult problem to start with line and polygon be semi algebraic set which both contain uncountable number of point here be a few off the cuff idea first we need to check if the line and the polygon be separate now the Jordan curve separation theorem say that the polygon divide the plane into exactly two open and thus non compact region thus the line lie completely inside the polygon the line lie completely outside the polygon or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersect the polyon now the phrasing of this question say if a line intersect a polygon so this be a decision problem one possibility the decision model approach be to reduce the question to some other well know problem Q and then try to solve Q. an answer to Q give an answer to the original decision problem in recent year many geometric problem have be successfully model in a new language call PostScript see PostScript Language by Adobe Systems Incorporated isbn   0 201 10179 3 co. 1985 so give a line L and a polygon P we can write a PostScript program that draw the line L and the polygon P and then output the answer by output we mean the program execute a command call showpage which actually print a page of paper contain the line and the polygon a quick examination of the paper provide an answer to the reduce problem Q and thus the original problem there be two small problem with this approach t(1 there be an infinite number of way to encode L and p into the treduce problem Q. so we will be force to invoke the Axiom of tchoice or equivalently Zorn 's Lemma but the use of the Axiom of tchoice be not regard in a very serious light these day t(2 more importantly the question arise as to whether or not the tPostScript program q will actually output a piece of paper- or in tother word will it halt tNow PostScript be expressive enough to encode everything that a tturing machine might do- thus the halting problem for PostScript be tundecidable it be quite possible that the original problem will turn tout to be undecidable I wo n't even begin to go into other difficulty such as aliasing finite precision and run out of ink paper or both a couple of reference might be 1 Principia Mathematica Newton I.

412;I do n't think I 've change my stance at all my original stance be that a painless execution be not a cruel one I did n't say what would be consider cruel only that a painless death was n't now cruelty must involve some sort of suffering I believe I do n't think someone that get shoot in the head or electrocute really suffer very much even a hanging probably produce one sharp instance of pain but it be over so quickly Pardon no well again I state that a painless death is n't cruel but I do n't think I state that all painful execution   be   cruel I think that some be cruel depend on the nature and duration of the pain anything more than an instant I guess any death by suffocation asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think this include the gas chamber and draw and quarter i 'd say that any pain that last say over twenty second or so would be too long but this may be an arbitrary cutoff I suppose;0

1943;read from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet their erl-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement have a compressive strength of 280,000 psi it have a density of 0.058 lb   cu in therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself be 4.8 million inch or 400,000 ft or 75 Statute mile now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss type or guy wire or both and will be use below the crush strength let we assume that we will operate at 40 of the theoretical strength this give a work height of 30 mile for a constant section column a constant section column be not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up for example let we say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in calculation this require 2.5 square inch of column cross sectional area to support the weight the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb so at 1 mile below the payload the total load be now 289,200 lb a 3.3 increase the next mile of structure must be 3.3 thick in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom we can see from this that there be no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limit base on how much composite we can afford to by at   40   lb and how much load you need to support on the ground for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support let we arbitrarily choose   1 billion as the limit in costruction cost with this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composite assume our finished structure cost   100   lb the   40   lb figure be just for material cost then we have a tower   payload mass ratio of 35.7:1 at a 3.3 mass ratio per mile the tower height become 111 mile this be clearly above the significant atmosphere a rocket launch from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and g loss will be almost eliminate g loss be the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity thus they represent waste thrust together with drag rocket start from the ground have a 15 velocity penalty to contend with this analysis be simplify in that it do not consider wind load these will require more structural support over the first 15 mile of height above that the air pressure drop to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor Dani Eder;2

2002;what evidence indicate that Gamma Ray burster be very far away their distribution be very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speak indicate we 're see an edge to the distribution give the enormous power I be just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range now in the good old day before GRO datum it be think the gamma burster be neutron star in the galaxy it be expect that GRO would confirm this by either show they be a local population within a few hundred light year or that they be in the galactic halo mechanism be not know but several plausible one exist also to be fair it be note that the   bright   burster be probably in the LMC suggest theorist might be wrong back then tas the Sun be not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population be rule out completely at this stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then get large the mechanism of get NS out that far become questionable and we should start to see for example the Andromeda 's burster tthe datum be consistent with either a oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum or it can be a cosmological distance hence isotropy and the edge be the edge of the Universe if at cosmological distance you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star collide with another neutron star or black hole even then get the spectrum be very hard but conceivable tif we know anything about physics at that level the burster be not due to quantum black hole or cosmic string wrong spectrum for one thing the situation be far complicate by recent claim that there be two class of source   in the collide NS they 'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS NS and NS BH collision scenario respectively   my own pet theory be that it 's Flying saucer enter hyperspace but the reason I be ask be that most everyone assume that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole I just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place they close in if you can think of one remember to invite I to Stockholm;2

1411;Mr DeCenso in spite of require scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas reject that the scholarly opinion of the those scholar and then rephrase those scholar opinion on the subject and actually if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will find that it do denote success those scholar do indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide be successful as I point out I recently check several Lexicons tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament Louw and Nida tRobinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament Grimm tWord study Concordance Tynsdale tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other t early Christian Writings Bauer Arndt Gingrich tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon Perschbacher a couple simply state hang oneself and a couple be more explicit and state that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hang a couple also note that the meaning of one the root word for apacgw be strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidate the guy who suggest to David Joslin that Judas be hang upside down one of the good reference though Robinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament not only state the translation it give both the root word the literal translation relate greek word which use the same root and also other present specific example of the word in greek literature to give further context the word apagchw have two root word gchw be the to strangle root and the root word apo mean literally away this root word be include in word which denote a transition it can mean a transition in place eg the greek word apagello mean to send a message Apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death Robinson specifically make comparison to the word apokteiuo which mean to kill in literal meaning the word apacgw mean to throttle strangle to put out of the way and implicitly denote a change in life state ie away from life to death so while the word apacgw do mean to hang it specifically denote a death as well thus Robinson be quite specific when he state that it mean to hang oneself to end one 's life by hang he then note the the use of apacgw in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context he present that example of apacgw as be use to explicitly mean suicide by hang now since there be a perfectly good word for strangle without the add denotation of death and as you insist that the Bible be write by God and every word be precicely correct you be stick with the complete meaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw be use then death be denote as the result by the way I note that Mr DeCenso also present an example of apacgw note Mr DeCenso as you say the septuagint be a translation from Hebrew to Greek and you have not show the original meaning of the Hebrew ie the the Hebrew say and die and thus whether it be simply echo in the Greek it should also be point out that regardless of the add and die the correct translation would still be apacgw as the man do indeed die from strangulation redundant but correct far we have evidence that the septuagint be repeatedly rewrite and reedite which include version which contradict each other and such editing be not even necessarily execute by Greeks thus I be not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stand as a paragon of ancient greek so what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso be an example in ancient greek of someone commit apacgw and survive otherwise I would see you as simply make worthless assertion without correspond evidence now I would note Mr DeCenso that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrive exegisis I pretty much find it false thus I think that if you be go to add to the text something over and above what the source clearly say then you have well have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it by the way as to Mr Rose 's statement about tree around the potter 's field unless Mr Rose can show that these tree be two thousand year old or that there be 2000 year old stump there or have a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mention such tree then it be inappropriate for he to assert that the present placement of tree prove the location of the tree two thousand year ago after all thing change now as to your other argument ie that the money Judas use be not the same as the 30 silver true Peter or the author of act do not specifically call Judas betrayal an iniquity but for that matter neither do John specifically call Judas action an iniquity either Further John 13:29 do not say that Judas take some think that because Judas have the money box Jesus be tell he buy what we need for the feast- or that he should give something to the poor so after receive the morsel he immediately go out and it be night note that it be say that Judas leave it do not say that he take the money box thus when I see your explanation it still seem to I you would choose the a an unproven iniquity mention by another author in a different book write at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mention by the author of act I find this force and contrive of course this particular argument become moot since we have have see evidence that apacgw mean suicide you see since Judas hanging be successful he could not have spend the money mention in John 13:29 because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal be on the high holy day ie Passover and thus he could not have spend the money before kill himself the next day thus the money which buy the Field of blood would have to have be the 30 piece of silver of course he get the 30 piece of silver that night as well and thus could n't have spend that either oh dear I believe that the house of card be comme down maybe we should at this point discuss now whether Jesus be crucify on Friday or Saturday as that be now part of the argument about Judas by the way as to where the prophesy of the potter 's field come from ie the mention of it in Matthew you say I be remind you now to discuss it now It 's all part of the same verse we be discuss and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestep these issue ttttLater ttttDave Butler tA wise man proportion his belief to the evidence ttttDavid Hume Philosopher ttttAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding;3

728;bill I have take the time to explain that biblical scholar consider the Josephus reference to be an early christian insert by biblical scholar I mean an expert who in the course of his or her research be willing to let the chip fall where they may this exclude literalist who may otherwise be define as biblical apologist they find what they want to find they be not trustworthy by scholarly standard and other why an insert read it I have a number of time the passage be glaringly out of context and Josephus a superb writer have no such problem elsewhere in his work the passage have   nothing   to do with the subject matter in which it lie it suddenly appear and then just as quickly disappear until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community be wrong about the Josephus insert your proof be meaningless and it should not be repeat here What 's more even if Josephus happen to be legitimate it would prove nothing scholar speak of the weight of evidence far more independent evidence would be require to validate your claim until forthcoming your belief be base on faith That 's OK but you exceed your right when you pass faith off as fact as for the gospel there be parallel but there be also glare inconsistency and contradiction Should n't a perfect canon be perfect Should n't there be absolutely no room for debate I suggest you read   Gospel Fictions   by Randel Helms and   the Unauthorized Version   by Robin Fox for Herb Huston no know kinship or familial relationship but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry the fact that there be inconsistency gap and contradiction do not deny your position on the other hand neither do the gospel prove your faith independent evidence be necessary and I know of none which we have already discuss and so far you have not provide any until then its faith moreover you have commit a fundamental error in logic you have attempt to prove your claim with that which you want to prove its no different than say I be right because I say so your logic be full of circle it remind I a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly the assembly define five fundamental this be where fundamentalist come from of orthodox Protestant Christianity to wit 1 Jesus perform miracle 2 Jesus be bear of a virgin 3 Jesus be bodily resurrect 4 Jesus crucifixion atone for human sin and here be the clincher 5 the bible be the inerrant word of God presbyterian construe inerrant broadly as spritually inerrant fundamentalist take the first four as literally true and then validate they with a literally inerrant bible which contain the first four and which be the only thing know to contain the first four smoke and mirror and wand and hand wave if ever there be its faith Bill you do n't have any more or well truth than anyone else whatever work for you just do n't foist it on other regard;3

60;John E. King kingctron.com post a whopping one liner   the modern theory of evolution be so inadequate that it deserve to be    treat as a matter of faith Francis Hitching   I have a few point to make about the above posting 1 science be not base on and do not consist of quote from either real or alleged expert critical reasoning evidence and if possible experimentation be necessary creationist frequently display a massive confusion about this by merely quote both non expert and expert alike some of the latter quote be in fact false and steadfastly refuse to follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure this strongly suggest that a. their claim completely lack any scientific merit and b. they be aware of this fatal deficiency of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent 2 you have fail to identify Hitching and the surround context of his statement why be that if Hitching be a scientific illiterate then the quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology creationist be frequently know to quote real scientist out of context and to fabricate statement that they subsequently attribute to legitimate scientist of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent 3 evidence support the allege inadequacy of the modern theory of evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one line quote from an unidentified nobody it be also important to note that disprove biological evolution do not automatically prove some alternate claim any more that disprove that the earth be shape like a hockey puck prove that it be a hyperbolic paraboloid creationist seem rather fond of diving head first into this logical fallacy of course you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent 4 since evolution be central to virtually all of modern science an attack on evolution either the fact or the theory really represent an attack on science while the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve B the fact of evolution will not ever go away creationist lose the battle long ago more than 100 year in fact but be simply too willfully ignorant and irrational to acknowledge the fact of course you may not actually be a creationist and you may not really be that ignorant Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub kv07IASTATE.EDU ask   neither I nor Webster 's have ever hear of Francis Hitchings who be he   I like hitching be not to be find in Webster 's B Francis Hitchings be a scientifically illiterate creationist or perhaps he be just play the part of one who write a quite ignorant book attack evolution the Neck of the Giraffe in that publication he quote a creationist Jean Sloat Morton use the standard invalid creationist probability argument that protein could not have form by chance thus not only confuse abiogenesis with evolution the two be quite independent but also conclude with a non sequitur i.e. the conclusion do not follow   pp 70 71   hitching also misquote Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism   pp 84   hitching book be review by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times and repeat in the Oregonian the article be title   Giraffe stick scientific neck out too far excerpt include Francis Hitchings be not a biologist he go after Darwin like Mark Antony after Brutus he flip from scientific reasoning to mysticism and pseudo science with the sinuosity of a snake oil salesman he suggest a mystical   organizing principle of life use the similarity of organ in different creature as evidence   sic   note that the last statement above be actually evidence for evolution not against it if John E.

Engineering Research Lab CERL it be a popular geographic and remote sense image processing package many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image processing package although it be report to have significant image processing capability Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it 's public domain and can be obtain through the internet for free GRASS run in Unix and be write in C. the source code can be obtain through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass Integration you then compile the source code for your machine use script provide with GRASS I would recommend GRASS for someone who already have a workstation and be on a limited budget GRASS be not very user friendly compare to Macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicate

application Host Configuration Requirements it run on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun though there be rumor there be always rumor that the software would be port to pc and possibly a Sun environment PCI a company call PCI Inc. out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada make an array of software utility for processing manipulation and use of remote sense datum in eight or ten different industry standard format LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of other whose title I forget the software be available in version for MS DOS Unix workstation among they HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly other platform by now I use the VMS version the PCI software consist of several class   group   package of utility group by function but all operate on a common pci database disk file the Tape I   o package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote sense industry tape format INTO or write those format out from the PCI database file- this be the only package I use or know much about other package can display datum from the PCI database to one or another of several pci support third party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image datum to an attached printer e.g. an Epson type dot matrix graphic printer you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operation package histo- gram and Fourier analysis equalization user specify operation e.g. multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and God only know what all else there 's a LOT I do n't have and do n't use these so ca n't say much about them- you only buy the package your particular application   interest call for each utility be control by from one to eight parameter read from a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default directory some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing set up a series of operation the standard PCI environment contain a scripting language very similar to IBM pc BASIC but which allow you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in VMS I can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure There 's also an optional programming library which allow you to write compile language program which can interface with read from   write to the PCI datum structure database file parameter file the PCI software be design specifically for remote sense image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing as well for instance the Tape I   o package offer a utility for read headerless multi band what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh call raw datum from tape in a number of different interleave order this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic art industry 's CT2 T format would probably I have n't try handle Targa and so on above all however you have to know what YOU'RE do or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over It 's worth note that the PCI database file be design to contain not only raster image datum but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land use and all manner of other information I observe that a remote sense image tape often contain all manner of information about the spectral band latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass- all of this can go into the PCI database I   believe   that on workstation the build in display be use on VAX system other than workstation pci support only a couple of specific third party display system the name Gould   Deanza seem to come to mind one of MY personal workaround be a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a Peritek VCT Q Q bus 24 bit DirectColor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case- it seems design for the very high end application   user i.e. those for whom a Mac   PC largely does n't suffice although as you know the gap be get small all the time It 's probably no coincidence that PCI be locate in Canada a country which do a LOT of its land   resource management via remote sensing- I believe the canadian government use PCI software for some of its work in these area SPAM Spectral Analysis

943;Rick I think we can safely say 1 Robert be not the only person who understand the Bible and 2 the leadership of the LDS church historicly never have Let 's consider some personal interpretation and see how much trust we should put in Orthodox Mormonism which could never be confuse with Orthodox Christianity in one of his attack on Christians the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie say they thrash around in darkness in try to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise Messiah he also say Christians be wrong to believe that Jehovah be the Supreme Deity   God the Father   and that Christ come into mortality as his only Begotten Son McConkie then state what mormon believe today to be the truth about the matter he say that Elohim be the Father and Jehovah be the Son be thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualist have go in define their three in one God it come as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in try to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise Messiah some sectarian even believe that Jehovah be the Supreme Deity whose Son come into mortality as the only Begotten as with their concept that God be a Spirit this misinformation about the Gods of Heaven be untrue the fact be and it too be attest by Holy Writ that Elohim be the Father and that Jehovah be the Son who be bear into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ the promise Messiah Promised Messiah p. 100 Notice that McConkie say the Christians be as wrong about their three in one God and their belief that God be a Spirit as they be in their understanding of who Elohim and Jehovah be before examine McConkie 's attack and its validity we shall read a few more statement by McConkie and other Mormon source concern the word Elohim and Jehovah McConkie state the chief designation of Christ that have be preserve for we in the Old Testament as that ancient work be now publish be the exalt name title Jehovah Promised Messiah p. 367   Elohim   plural word though it be be also use as the exalt name title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connote his supremacy and omnipotence he be God above all god Mormon Doctrine p. 224 agree with McConkie on the question of who Elohim and Jehovah be the Apostle James E. Talmage state   Elohim   as understand and use in the restore Church of Jesus Christ be the name title of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit be   Jehovah   the only Begotten in the flesh Jesus Christ Jesus the Christ p. 38 a Doctrinal Exposition by the First Presidency and the twelve apostle of the Mormon Church state that God the Eternal Father is   designated   by the exalt name title elohim Articles of Faith p. 466 Christ in his preexistent antemortal or unembodied state be know as Jehovah Articles of Faith p. 471 today Mormon leader teach that Elohim in the OT refer to God the Father and Jehovah refer to Christ McConkie attack Christians for say Jehovah can refer to the Father he stress that these two name title should not be change around so that Christ be call Elohim and the Father be call Jehovah the Father be Elohim not Jehovah Jehovah be Christ and Christ be Jehovah- they be one and the same person Promised Messiah p. 111 in the OT of the kjv of the Bible the hebrew word Elohim be use to refer to the true God false god and goddess and the judge of Israel when refer to the true God Elohim be translate with a capital G. when refer to false god and goddess and the judge of Israel it be translate with a small g. it be translate four time as judge Exod 21:6- 22:8 9 once as judge 1 Sam 2:25 twice as mighty Gen. 23:6- Exod 9:28 once as angel Ps 8:5 once as godly Mal 2:15 once as great Gen. 30:8 and once as very great 1 Sam 14:15 the word Jehovah be the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or yhvh with the vowel point take from the word Adonai many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation be Yahweh or Yahveh however since Jehovah rather than Yahweh be the word use by Mormonism this section will also use Jehovah instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claim of Mormon leader regard that name Jehovah unlike Elohim be never use of false god it be the personal name of the triune God of the Bible in the kjv Jehovah be render primarily LORD sometimes GOD and rarely Lord now that we understand something about the word Elohim and Jehovah and their use by Mormon leader we shall consider the Apostle mcconkie 's attack on Christians for believe the Father be Jehovah in try to prove that Jehovah refer exclusively to Christ McConkie cite several verse from the Bible some of these verse and McConkie 's interpretation of they will be examine to see whether he be right remember McConkie say the Father be not Jehovah- he be only Elohim the first example we shall consider involve McConkie 's interpretation of Ps 110:1 of this verse he state of whom spake David when his tongue be touch by the Holy Spirit and he testify the Lord say unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemy thy footstool Ps 110:1 two Lords be here involve one be speak to the other- one be great than the other- one be make provision for the triumph and glory of the other who be they and what message be contain in this messianic prophecy what think ye of Christ our Lord ask certain of his detractor toward the end of his mortal ministry whose son be he be Christ the Son of God or of someone else be he to be bear of a divine Parent or will he be as other man a mortal son of a mortal father that he be to be a descendant of David be a matter of great pride to all the Jews and so they answer the Son of David David 's son truly he be but he be more much more and so our Lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture ask how then doth David in spirit call he Lord say the Lord say unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemy thy footstool if David then call he Lord how be he his son that be if he be only the Son of David how be it that the great king act under inspiration call he Lord and worship he as such and we might add   who be the other Lord the one who spake unto David 's Lord   can there be any question as to how Jesus be interpret the word of the Psalm he be say that it mean the Father say unto the Son Elohim say unto Jehovah   sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry- then I will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with I where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever Promised Messiah pp 101 102 emphasis add agree with the above statement by McConkie the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet   what the mormon think of Christ p. 6 read the Lord   Elohim the Father   say unto my Lord   Jehovah the Son   bracket in original McConkie clearly state that it be Elohim the Father who be speak to Jehovah the Son in this Psalm however when one look at the hebrew word translate LORD it become apparent that either the first LORD be not the Father or else the Father be Jehovah either way McConkie be wrong the Psalm read the LORD   Jehovah   say unto my Lord   Adon   sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemy thy footstool Ps 110:1 the first LORD in this verse be Jehovah who Mormonism say be Christ not the Father the second Lord be the hebrew word Adon singular for Adonai mean master or lord if the first LORD be the Father and the second Lord be the Son then the Father be Jehovah and the Son be Adon however if the Father be not Jehovah as McConkie claim then the first LORD be Jehovah the Son but who then be Adon obviously the Father be Jehovah in this Psalm and his Son be Adon another example involve Isa 42:6 about which McConkie state the following I the Lord have call thee in righteousness   Isaiah quote the Father as say of Christ   and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles Isa 42:6 Promised Messiah p. 81 emphasis add McConkie say the Father be speak of Christ in this passage which read I the LORD   Jehovah   have call thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles Isa 42:6 accord to McConkie I the LORD refer to the Father and thine and thee refer to Christ however the LORD who be speak be Jehovah which mean either McConkie be wrong about who be speak or else the Father be Jehovah another example involve Ps 22:7 8 of these verse McConkie state shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the Lord that he would deliver he let he deliver he see he delight in he Ps 22:7 8   the fulfillment as Jesus hang on the cross   be find in these word the chief priest mock he with the scribe and elder say he saved others- himself he can not save if he be the King of Israel let he now come down from the cross and we will believe he he trust in God- let he deliver he now if he will have he for he say I be the Son of God the thief also which be crucify with he cast the same in his tooth Matt 27:41 44 Promised Messiah pp 530 531 emphasis add Ps 22:7 8 read as follow all they that see I laugh I to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the LORD   Jehovah   that he would deliver he let he deliver he see he delight in he McConkie say these verse have their fulfillment as Jesus hang on the cross that mean the person who be scorn in these verse be Christ who then be the LORD in whom he trust it be Jehovah the Father another example involve Ps 31:13 and Ps 41:9 regard they McConkie state the following with reference to the conniving and conspire plot incident to our lord 's arrest and judicial trial the prophecy be they take counsel together against I they devise to take away my life Ps 31:13 mine own familiar friend in whom I trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up his heel against I Ps 41:9 promise Messiah p. 532 Apostle McConkie say these Psalms refer to Christ 's arrest and judicial trial we shall first consider Ps 31 and then Ps 41 while McConkie only quote verse 13 of Ps 31 verse 14 will also be include to give a complete understanding of the matter for I have hear the slander of many fear be on every side while they take counsel together against I they devise to take away my life but I trust in thee o LORD   Jehovah   I say Thou art my God   elohim   Ps 31:13 14 McConkie say verse 13 refer to Jesus Christ verse 14 go on to tell that he Christ trust in the LORD who be call his God or Elohim mormonism teach that the God above Jesus be Elohim the Father verse 14 however reveal that the Elohim of the man Jesus be Jehovah the Father in Ps 41 McConkie only quote one verse- however two verse will be consider in this examination Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up his heel against I but thou o LORD   Jehovah   be merciful unto I and raise I up that I may requite they Ps 41:9 10 McConkie state above that verse 9 refer to Judas role in Christ 's death since it be Judas who be the familiar friend who lift up his heel the pronoun mine I my and I in verse 9 must refer to Christ notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there be a change of pronoun to thou which refer to the LORD Jehovah then the pronoun I and I which refer to Christ be use again that mean Christ be speak to Jehovah the Father in these verse another example involve McConkie 's follow remark about Ps 110:4 one of the great messianic prophecy speak by the mouth of David ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps 110:4 Promised Messiah p. 450 McConkie admit this be a messianic prophecy involve Christ the question be what in this verse refer to Christ the LORD   Jehovah   hath swear and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps 110:4 do the LORD which be Jehovah refer to Christ if McConkie be right and Jesus be Jehovah but the Father be not then the LORD would have to refer to Christ but who then be the one address as the priest forever after the order of Melchizedek the Bible reveal that the one refer to be Jesus Christ Heb 5:8 10- 6:20- 7)- therefore the LORD Jehovah in Ps 110:4 be the Father another example involve Isa 53:4 12 of these verse McConkie state of the atone sacrifice of the future Messiah Isaiah say the   Lord   have lay on he the iniquity of we all it please the   Lord   to bruise he Promised Messiah p. 234 emphasis add McConkie rightly say these verse refer to the atone sacrifice of the future Messiah however what he fail to mention be that they also prove that the Father be Jehovah verse 6 read all we like sheep have go astray- we have turn every one to his own way- and the LORD   Jehovah   hath lay on he   Christ   the iniquity of we all and verse 10 read yet it please the LORD   Jehovah   to bruise he   Christ   obviously the LORD who lay on Christ the iniquity of we all and who bruise he be God the Father who be call Jehovah in these verse remember McConkie state that some sectarian even believe that Jehovah be the Supreme Deity and that Christ come into mortality as his only Begotten Son he call this concept misinformation that be untrue to prove that it be McConkie who be misinformed and believe untruth two scriptural reference 2 Sam 7:14- Ps 2:7 will be examine McConkie state the following regard these scripture in the midst of a passage that be clearly messianic the Lord say of the Seed of David I will be his father and he shall be my son 2 Sam 7:14 in the second Psalm the whole of which be also clearly messianic occur this statement thou art my Son- this day have I beget thee Ps 2:7 Paul quote both of these statement in Hebrews 1:5 and say they be prophecy that Christ would come as the Son of God Promised Messiah p. 143 McConkie cite Heb 1:5 to show that 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 2:7 refer to Christ who would come as the Son of God since McConkie first reference 2 Sam 7:14 this examination will too however along with verse 14 verses 11 13 will also be include and as since the time that I command judge to be over my people Israel and have cause thee to rest from all thine enemy also the LORD   Jehovah   telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy day be fulfil and thou shalt sleep with thy father I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowel and I will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever I will be his father and he shall be my son 2 Sam 7:11 14 these verse teach that the LORD Jehovah would have a Son the Messiah in the second example McConkie cite Ps 2:7 this examination will include verse 8 notice that it be the LORD Jehovah who say Thou art my Son- this day have I beget thee I will declare the decree the LORD   Jehovah   hath say unto I Thou art my Son- this day have I beget thee ask of I and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost part of the earth for thy possession McConkie say these verse of scripture be clearly messianic and he acknowledge they teach that Christ would come as the Son of God what he be not willing to acknowledge however be that these scripture also teach that the Father be Jehovah and that the sectarian who believe Jehovah be the Supreme Deity whose Son be Jesus Christ the only Begotten be right in their belief another example involve Mic 5:4 of this verse McConkie state the following and so truly do our Lord act   during his mortal ministry truly this be he of whom it be write   he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth Mic 5:4 Promised Messiah p. 182 emphasis add accord to McConkie the pronoun he at the beginning of Mic 5:4 refer to Christ during his mortal ministry who then be the LORD his God Mic 5:4 read and he   Christ   shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD   Jehovah   in the majesty of the name of the LORD   Jehovah   his God   elohim   for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth obviously the LORD of Jesus Christ be Jehovah the Father who be refer to as Jehovah his Elohim another example involve Ps 2:2 and Isa 61:1 of these verse McConkie state the follow a number of messianic passage speak of the Lord and his anoint Ps 2:2 signify that the Chosen One be consecrate and set apart for the ministry and mission that be his   Jesus apply these passage to himself   by quote Isaiah 's prophecy the Lord hath anoint I to preach good tiding unto the meek Isa 61:1 and then say this day be this scripture fulfil in your ear Luke 4:21 Promised Messiah pp 182 183 emphasis add the first source McConkie quote Ps 2:2 read as follow the king of the earth set themselves and the ruler take counsel together against the LORD   Jehovah   and against his anointed McConkie say the anointed one be Christ if that be true who be Jehovah if Jehovah be always Christ who be the anointed one obviously Jehovah be refer to God the Father and the anointed be indeed refer to Christ the second source McConkie cite be Isa 61:1 which state the Spirit of the Lord   Adonai   GOD   Jehovah   be upon me- because the LORD   Jehovah   hath anoint I to preach good tiding unto the meek- he hath send I to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to they that be bound- the one who be anoint to preach bind up proclaim and open be Jesus Christ who then be the one who anoint he this verse say the LORD Jehovah do the anointing again we face the same problem if Jehovah do not refer to the Father but only to Christ then Jesus anoint someone but who as McConkie point out Jesus apply these passage to himself therefore the Jehovah who anoint Christ be God the Father other example could be cite to show that McConkie and other Mormon leader be wrong when they say God the Father be not Jehovah however these should be enough to expose their error now what about Mormonism 's claim that Jesus be Jehovah but he be not Elohim it be true that Jesus be Jehovah the following scripture prove this fact thus saith the LORD   Jehovah   the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD   Jehovah   of hosts- I be the first and I be the last- and beside I there be no God Isa 44:6   Jesus say   I be the first and the last I be he that liveth and be dead Rev. 1:17 18 saith the LORD   Jehovah they shall look upon I whom they have pierce and they shall mourn for he as one mourneth for his only son Zech 12:1,10 Behold he   Christ   cometh with clouds- and every eye shall see he and they also which pierce he Rev. 1:7 I be the LORD   Jehovah   thy God the Holy One of Israel Isa 43:3 Ye deny the Holy One   Christ   and the just act 3:14 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD   Jehovah   shall be deliver Joel 2:32 the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth there be none other name under heaven give among man whereby we must be save act 4:10,12 Behold the Lord GOD   Jehovah   will come with strong hand his reward be with he Isa 40:10 Behold I   Christ   come quickly- and my reward be with I Rev. 22:12 the LORD   Jehovah   my God shall come and all the saint with thee Zech 14:5 at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saint 1 Thess 3:13 the LORD   Jehovah   be my shepherd Ps 23:1   Jesus say   I be the good shepherd John 10:14 saith the Lord GOD   Jehovah   I will seek that which be lose Ezek 34:15 16 the Son of man be come to seek and to save that which be lose Luke 19:10 for I be the LORD   Jehovah   thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Saviour Isa 43:3 look for that bless hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ Tit 2:13 see also Jer 42:5 and Rev. 1:5- Mal 3:6 and Heb 13:8- 1 Kin 8:28,39 and John 2:24 25- Isa 25:8 and 2 Tim 1:10- Ps 107:24,29 and Matt 8:26- prov.3:12 and Rev. 3:19 while mormon be right when they say Jesus be Jehovah they be wrong when they say he be not Elohim the Bible reveal that Jehovah be the only true Elohim there is- all other be false remember Jehovah be the personal name of the triune God who have reveal himself in the Bible before we consider biblical quote which show that Jehovah and Elohim be not two separate god as Mormons claim let we first note that not only be both God the Father and Christ address as Jehovah and Elohim but so be the Holy Spirit Whereof the   Holy Ghost said this   be   the covenant that I will make with they after those day saith the Lord I will put my law into their heart and in their mind will I write them- and their sin and iniquity will I remember no more Heb 10:15 17 emphasis on Holy Ghost and say add Behold the day come   saith the LORD    Jehovah   that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah I will put my law in their inward part and write it in their hearts- and will be their God   Elohim   and they shall be my people I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more Jer 31:31,33 34 emphasis add for the prophecy come not in old time by the will of man but holy man of God spake as they be move by the   Holy Ghost   2 Pet 1:21 emphasis on Holy Ghost add the Spirit of the LORD   Jehovah   spake by I and his word be in my tongue 2 Sam 23:2 see also Heb 3:7 11 with Ps 95:6 11 let we now continue with the biblical quote which show that Jehovah and Elohim be not two separate god as mormon claim and when the LORD   Jehovah   see that he   Moses   turn aside to see God   elohim   call unto he out of the midst of the bush and say Moses Moses and he say here be I   Bruce R. McConkie acknowledge that it be Christ 's voice that speak to Moses in the burn bush promise Messiah p. 394   and the LORD   Jehovah   say and Moses say unto God   Elohim   Behold when I come unto the child of Israel and shall say unto they the God   elohim   of your father hath send I unto you- and they shall say to I what be his name what shall I say unto they and God   elohim   say unto Moses I be that I be and he say thus shalt thou say unto the child of Israel I be hath send I unto you and God   Elohim   say moreover unto Moses thus shalt thou say unto the child of Israel the LORD   Jehovah   God   elohim   of your father the God   elohim   of Abraham the God   elohim   of Isaac and the God   elohim   of Jacob hath send I unto you this be my name for ever and this be my memorial unto all generation Exod 3:4,7,13 15 and God   elohim   spake unto Moses and say unto he I be the LORD   Jehovah   Exod 6:2 I be the LORD   Jehovah   and there be none else there be no God   elohim   beside I I gird thee though thou hast not know I Isa 45:5 but the LORD   Jehovah   be the true God   Elohim   he be the live God   elohim   and an everlasting king Jer 10:10 thus saith the LORD   Jehovah   the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD   Jehovah   of hosts- I be the first and I be the last- and beside I there be no God   elohim   Isa 44:6 therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus saith the LORD   Jehovah   whose name be the God   elohim   of host Amos 5:27 Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens be the lord 's   Jehovah 's   thy God   Elohim   the earth also with all that therein be Deut 10:14 wherefore thou art great o LORD   Jehovah   God   elohim   for there be none like thee neither be there any God   elohim   beside thee accord to all that we have hear with our ear 2 Sam 7:22 and he say unto they I be an hebrew- and I fear the LORD   Jehovah   the God   elohim   of heaven which hath make the sea and the dry land Jon 1:9 for who be God   elohim   save the LORD   Jehovah   or who be a rock save our God   elohim   Ps 18:31 Blessed be the nation whose God   elohim   be the LORD   Jehovah   Ps 33:12 see also Ps 144:15 Hast thou not know hast thou not hear that the everlaste God   elohim   the LORD   Jehovah   the Creator of the end of the earth fainteth not neither be weary there be no searching of his understanding Isa 40:28 the mighty God   Elohim   even the LORD   Jehovah   hath speak and call the earth from the rise of the sun unto the go down thereof Ps 50:1 sing unto God   Elohim   sing praise to his name estol he that rideth upon the heaven by his name JAH and rejoice before he Ps 68:4   regard the word Jah Bruce R.

McConkie involve Jehovah and his creation be the belief that Jehovah have many pre mortal spirit help he create include in this allege group be Joseph Smith Jr. that he   Christ   be aid in the creation of this earth by many of the noble and great spirit child of the Father be evident from go down for there be space there and we will take of these material and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell Abra 3:22 24 Michael or Adam be one of these Enoch Noah Abraham Moses Peter James and John Joseph Smith and many other noble and great one play a part in the great creative enterprise Doctrines of Salvation vol 1 pp 74 75 Mormon Doctrine p. 169 the Bible reveal the truth about this matter thus saith the LORD   Jehovah   thy redeemer and he that form thee from the womb I be the LORD   Jehovah   that maketh all things- that stretcheth forth the heavens alone- that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself Isa 44:24 which alone spreadeth out the heaven and treadeth upon the wave of the sea Job 9:8 Jehovah by himself create all thing he have no alleged preexistent spirit helper assist he regard the Mormon Elohim the Apostle McConkie state Elohim plural word though it be be also use as the exalt name title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connote his supremacy and omnipotence he be God above all god Mormon Doctrine p. 224 he also state that Jesus be above all save the Father only Promised Messiah p. 363 the Bible state that the one who be God above all so call god be the triune God Jehovah for the LORD   Jehovah   be a great God   El   and a great king above all god   elohim   Ps 95:3 for thou LORD   Jehovah   art high above all the earth thou art exalt far above all god   elohim   Ps 97:9 now I know that the LORD   Jehovah   be great than all god   elohim   Exod 18:11 see also Ps 135:5- Deut 10:17 if Mormon leader be right when they say Jehovah be god the son and Elohim be god the father these verse from the Bible would be teach that the Mormon son be above his father however as McConkie clearly state mormon believe Elohim the father not Jehovah the son be the God above all Gods that Jesus be above all except the father- yet the Bible teach that Jehovah be above all Elohim at a BYU Dev on March 2 1982 Bruce R. McConkie make the following remark about pray to Jesus another peril be that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel have be develop this be plain sectarian nonsense our prayer be address to the Father and to he only perfect prayer be address to the Father in the name of the Son- it be utter by the power of the Holy Ghost our relationship with the Lord pp 19 20 McConkie state on p. 335 of his book promise Messiah that the mormon pray to the Father not the Son on p. 306 of the same book McConkie state that Christ   the Son   be Jehovah this be important to remember because although McConkie say prayer be not to be offer to the Mormon Christ who be Jehovah the Bible state repeatedly in the OT that people pray to Jehovah and he not only hear those prayer but he accept they as valid request the follow be but a small sample of the vast number of time people pray to Jehovah in my distress I call upon the LORD   Jehovah   and cry unto my God   elohim   he hear my voice out of his temple and my cry come before he even into his ear Ps 18:6 and the LORD   Jehovah   say unto he I have hear thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast make before I I have hallow this house which thou hast build to put my name there for ever- and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetually 1 Kin 9:3 and say unto Jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accept before thee and pray for we unto the LORD   Jehovah   thy God   Elohim   even for all this remnant Jer 42:2 o LORD   Jehovah   I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servant who desire to fear thy name Neh 1:11 and it be so that when Solomon have make an end of pray all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD   Jehovah   he arise from before the altar of the LORD   Jehovah   from kneel on his knee with his hand spread up to heaven 1 Kin 8:54 he go in therefore and shut the door upon they twain and pray unto the LORD   Jehovah   2 Kin 4:33 go and say to Hezekiah thus saith the LORD   Jehovah   the God   elohim   of David thy father I have hear thy prayer I have see thy tear behold I will add unto thy day fifteen year Isa 38:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hide I say I will confess my transgression unto the LORD   jehovah- and thou forgav the iniquity of my sin for this shall every one that be godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be find Ps 32:5 6 notice above in Ps 32:6 that the godly pray to Jehovah accord to McConkie and other Mormon leader that be Christ the very one to whom McConkie say people should not pray the Bible reveal there be only one true Elohim and his name be Jehovah all other Elohim be false they be idol that cause their follower to commit adultery against the true Elohim and idolatry for the LORD   Jehovah   be great and greatly to be praise he be to be fear above all god   elohim   for all the god   elohim   of the nation be idol but the LORD   Jehovah   make the heaven Ps 96:4 5 Thou shalt have no other god   elohim   before I Exod 20:3 now I know that the LORD   Jehovah   be great than all god   elohim   Exod 18:11 and it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD   Jehovah   thy God   elohim   and walk after other god   elohim   and serve they and worship they I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish Deut 8:19 Thou shalt make no covenant with they nor with their god   elohim   they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against I for if thou serve their god   Elohim   it will surely be a snare unto thee Exod 23:32- 33 take heed to yourself that your heart be not deceive and ye turn aside and serve other god   Elohim   and worship they Deut 11:16 that ye come not among these nation these that remain among you- neither make mention of the name of their god   elohim   nor cause to swear by they neither serve they nor bow yourself unto they Josh 23:7 neither walk after other god   elohim   to your hurt Jer 7:6 but the LORD   Jehovah   be the true God   Elohim   he be the live God   elohim   Jer 10:10 and they forsook the LORD   Jehovah   God   elohim   of their father which bring they out of the land of Egypt and follow other god   elohim   of the god   elohim   of the people that be round about they and bow themselves unto they and provoke the LORD   Jehovah   to anger Jud 2:12 shall a man make god   elohim   unto himself and they be no god   elohim   therefore behold I will this once cause they to know I will cause they to know mine hand and my might- and they shall know that my name be the LORD   Jehovah   Jer 16:20 21 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD   Jehovah   choose you this day whom ye will serve- whether the god   elohim   which your father serve that be on the other side of the flood or the god   elohim   of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for I and my house we will serve the LORD   Jehovah   and the people answer and say God   elohim   forbid that we should forsake the LORD   Jehovah   to serve other god   elohim   Josh 24:15 16 these verse teach that the only true live Elohim in heaven and on earth be Jehovah the triune God who make heaven and earth and all therein Jehovah be great than any Elohim because all other Elohim be idol the reality behind they be demonic Deut 32:17 Jehovah Elohim have give explicit warning and guideline regard these false Elohim he tell his people not to have any Elohim but he he tell the people that if they leave he for the false Elohim those Elohim would be a snare to they and they would be hurt and would perish he warn the people to take heed that their heart be not deceive into worshiping serve swear by and make covenant with false Elohim Jehovah Elohim tell his people he would eventually judge all false Elohim and their follower despite these warning and guideline Elohim 's covenant people forsook he and believe in and worship the false Elohim 's of the people they come in contact with Ju 10:6 state that the child of Israel do evil again in the sight of the LORD   Jehovah   and serve Baalim and Ashtaroth and the god   elohim   of Syria and the god   elohim   of Zidon and the god   elohim   of Moab and the god   elohim   of the child of Ammon and the god   elohim   of the Philistines and forsook the LORD   Jehovah   and serve not he this examination have show that the Elohim of Mormonism like the Elohim in Ju 10:6 be not the true Jehovah Elohim therefore the people who leave the true Elohim for the Mormon Elohim will do evil in the sight of the LORD   Jehovah   although McConkie attack Christians for their belief in a triune God who be Spirit and for their belief that God the Father   Jehovah   send his Son into the world these belief be true God be triune- he be Spirit- he be Jehovah- and he do send his Son into the world to redeem mankind it be obvious from this examination that it be not the Christians who thrash around in darkness about who Elohim and Jehovah be one wonder what Holy Writ McConkie have in mind when he state that it attest to the fact that Elohim be the Father and that Jehovah be the Son he certainly do not mean the Bible which teach that the Father Son and Holy Spirit be all the one Jehovah Elohim he apparently do not mean the DC either because chapter 109 verses 1,4,9 10 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as Jehovah Summary obviously Joseph Fielding Smith 's statement that the Mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God Doctrines of Salvation 1:279 be not accurate the Mormon god be not the true God as Mormonism claim but be idol which cause their follower to commit adultery against God and idolatry in answer to Jesus question but whom say ye that I be mormon say Jesus be someone different from the Jesus who be reveal in the Bible and whom the apostle preach therefore anyone trust in the Mormon Jesus be believe in another Jesus whom Paul warn about Bernard P. Brockbank of the First Quorum of the Seventy admit in the May 1977 issue of the Ensign a Mormon publication that the Mormon Jesus be different from the Christian Jesus he state that it be true that many of the christian church worship a different Jesus Christ than be worship by the Mormons or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saint p. 26 the people who believe in the Mormon Jesus be commit adultery against God and idolatry they do not have the Son- therefore they do not have the Father and they do not have eternal life as the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly state salvation come only by worship the true God Promised Messiah p. 163 McConkie also rightly state that the mere worship of a god who have the proper scriptural name do not assure one that he be worship the true and live God because the true name of deity can be apply to false concept of God Mormon Doctrine p. 270 remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admit that Joseph Smith Jr. give a new conception of God and the Godhead contribution of Joseph Smith p. 1 it be important for the people who have leave the true triune God reveal in the Bible to repent and return to he they must forsake the sin of idolatry and adultery which they be commit in Mormonism all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from I shall be write in the earth because they have forsake the LORD   Jehovah   the fountain of living water Jer 17:13 and it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD   Jehovah   thy God   elohim   and walk after other god   elohim   and serve they and worship they I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish Deut 8:19 Thou shalt make no covenant with their god   elohim   Exod 23:32 put away the strange god   elohim   that be among you and be clean and change your garment Gen. 35:2 flee from idolatry 1 Cor 10:14 it be necessary that Christians hee the warning of the Bible if they do they will not fall into the sin of adultery against God and idolatry remember to know the only true God be eternal life John 17:3;3

229;I assume you be post to encourage comment how much history have Tony Campello read not much it seem it be good to hear that there be a few reasonable Christians about if only those christian scientist would take note in Australia there be a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientist who believe that every single event in the bible be exactly true and that there be a rational explanation for it all that can be justify by use the law of physics for example there be a few chap who be try to prove that the age of the universe be 6000 year old and that the error in conventional calculation be the result of the fact that the speed light have be rapidly decay over the year and this have not be account for or of course that he never exist and the bible be a story and be never intend to become a manifesto for a billion people do Tony follow that one up million of people have die for a lie this point be difficult to substantiate since it be not well define a great many religious argument work in that way but consider the many aztec warrior who sacrifice themselves to their god in the belief that this act would bring they victory of the spanish invader the list be endless the Aztecs lose BTW that be perfectly reasonable but it be not ground for I or anyone to become a christian more to the point it do not add weight to the claim that Jesus be the real thing have you ever see a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany more to the point do Tony mention this one could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleague fool or illogical man their support of Hitler be base I presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principle obviously my argument be invalid if Tony think that Hitler be sane Hmmm I do n't think his argument warrant the use of a Therefore this be unfortunately what alot of religious discussion I have have with people result in quote the bible the only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible be to treat the story as some sort of metaphorical representation of the message that the author be try to present if someone try to interpret part of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sort of shit Tony 's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the event describe in the bible take place but to convince someone who think the bible be total fiction that Jesus be real by quote the book be totally pointless for example in mathematic you can not say a be equal to b because a be equal to b. that would possibly explain why there have so many people be kill in religious war and why there be hundred of different version all claim to be correct it I think if you post this part to alt.religion you would get more flame than here I have never really understand why the emotional sentiment of a stranger should be of interest to other people someone famous say that there two evil in life polititian and church one rule by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead if I be press I could probably find the exact quotation;0
249;  recently I 've ask myself a rather interesting question what right do   god have on our life always assume there be a god of course    in his infinite wisdom he make it perfectly clear that if we do n't live   accord to his rule we will burn in hell well with what right can god   make that desicion Let 's say for the sake of argument that god create   every one of we directly or indirectly it does n't matter what then   happen be that he first create we and then turn we lose well I did n't   ask to be create    Let 's make an analogue if a scientist create a unique living creature   which have happen it be even patent do he then have the   right to expect it to behave in a certain matter or die Dear Joakim let I begin by say that these be excellent question but that by ask you will find as many different explanation as there be respondent as a latter day Saint I believe that all of we you I etc live once as spirit child of God the Father Hebrews 12:9 in the pre mortal existance in order to continue our eternal progression an earthly probationary time be require to live by faith not by sight to choose good over evil and to prepare ourselves in all thing to become worthy of a high order of existance we believe that all of God 's spirit offspring be once assemble to discuss the specific of this earthly sojourn one third chose for Lucifer 's plan most follow the Firstborn the pre mortal Jesus Christ Lucifer 's aspiration I will exalt my throne above the star of God Isaiah 14:12 17 etc result into the rebellion of his follower against the Firstborn and those who follow he result in the casting out of Lucifer who become Satan the father of lie and one third of the host of heaven and his tail draw the third part of the star of heaven and do cast they to the earth Revelation 12:4 as demon evil spirit to get back on our choice to be bear on this earth and to be subject to God and his plan for good or bad base upon our obedience and choice we make that choice individually God speak to Job where wast thou when I lay the foundation of the earth when the morning star sing together and all the son of God shout for joy Job 38:4 7 we lose the knowledge of our pre mortal existance the Veil of Forgetful- ness somewhere in Psalms in order to live by faith not by sight you may not accept this scenario neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone which offer only fragmentary insight into this particular aspect of our existence as individual as son and daughter of God   who be god to impose its rule on we who can tell if god be REALLY so   righteous as god like we to believe be all christian a flock of sheep   unable to do otherwise that follow the rest    Hmmmmmmmmmmmm all Christians by definition be a flock of sheep follow the Shepherd as they understand he --but in any event not all Christians believe in the same theology such as the one latter day saint believe in they will cry heresy and other accusation of pervert the doctrine of the Bible while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretation as find in their catechism and various do it yourself Bible study manual as for I I have a personal conviction that the pre existance scenario as explain above be most in harmony with biblical doctrine some Dead Sea Scroll book the pseudographion other jewish source and last but not least modern day revelation on the subject   I just want to point out that this be not sarcasm I mean it    how should one deal with a man who be convince that   he be act accord to God 's will and who there-   Jokke fore believe that he be do you a favour by   stab you in the back    -voltaire;3

1798;let I begin by say I think this be the world 's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium therefore even if this religion do not take off its found member will be very important historically as this method of solicit membership will eventually become common the basis of this religion be to apply various aspect of current conventional morality to the character in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the bible 's account of the fact and historical event be correct for example Story of Adam and Eve Adam and Eve be in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant have unlimited supply of food provide but no clothing job or knowledge God say not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge they do anyway then try to hide in bush God find they and force they out of Garden there be several different story on what they be do while naked in the bush that might have anger God Traditional Philosophy 1 the only reason you need knowledge or a job be to eat if someone else will provide you with food then you can be stupid and unemployed and it 's ok this be why married woman usually did n't work until recent decade 2 authority figure such as God whoever be behind the Vietnam War Hitler and slaveowner be always right and should be blindly follow without question by ordinary people who ca n't make decision for themselves interpretation of event base on Traditional Philosophy they be not suppose to eat the fruit they should have do whatever God tell they to like small child they have their need provide for and be obligate to do whatever their Father say to be force to leave the Garden and work in order to obtain food be a punishment lesson from Traditional Interpretation 1 ignorance be good Knowledge be bad but tempting 2 have food provide for you for nothing read welfare be ideal get- te a job and feed yourself with what you earn be punishment 3 public nudity be good cover up be bad 4 Authority figure be intrinsically right normal people be dumb and should do whatever they be tell without question they should not think for themselves 5 People in subordinate position be especially obligate to refrain from learn for example it should be illegal for slave to learn to read 1990 's philosophy 1 People should seek education and employment outside the home unless name Hillary Clinton or Murphy Brown 2 People should use common sense they should not kill other people bind of Issac war Holocaust etc just because they be tell to Interpretation of event base on current philosophy they be suppose to eat the fruit God gave want they to seek knowledge rather than be hand it on a silver platter once they have gain knowledge and by seek it show their ability to make mature decision for them- self they no long need to be treat like little child and be rewarded by be allow into the real world lesson from new interpretation 1 ignorance be bad Knowledge be good but must be seek 2 have food provide for you for nothing read welfare be at good a temporary measure get a job and feed yourself with what you earn be ideal 3 public nudity be bad cover up be good 4 Authority figure be often wrong normal people be intelligent and should consider whether the instruction be really a good idea and alter or abolish bad government they should think for themselves 5 People in subordinate decision be often discourage from knowledge but should seek it anyway and all the hard for example poor child without good school should work especially hard in order to make a well life for their child and themselves I have tentatively name this new philosophy the Church of Eveism because Eve 's decision to eat the apple be mansickind 's first good decision instead of its first bad one as traditionally believe she be therefore clearly a protagonist God at first appear evil for tell people not to seek knowledge but on deep analysis be also a protagonist as God reward the decision to defy he and provide the tree in the first place the intention and desire be clearly to have the knowledge be obtain but to delay it until it be actively seek ---end serious discussion begin humor.-- save this post to disk or file server someday it will be consider the most important writing since the 10 Commandments you want an original copy stay tune for the RFD on soc.religion.eveism can I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization --return to serious discussion when post follow ups.--;3

140;let we explore this interesting paragraph point by point sentence by sentence 1 we be talk about origin not merely science origin of what be we speak of the origin of life the human specie the universe physical law biological diversity or what 2 science can not explain origin this be a false statement unless it be carefully qualified it depend on what origin we be talk about 3 for a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origin be to say that there be no high truth than science again this be a false statement to begin with the notion of high truth be distinctly dubious many people believe that there be way to ascertain truth that be not in the repetoire of science- they even believe that there be way that be more reliable and certain many believe that there be truth that can not be express use the language of science let it be so these truth be neither high or lower- they be simply true more to the point restrict one 's discussion of origin to science do not reject other source of knowledge- it simply restrict the scope of discussion 4 this be a false premise if this be intend as assert that the previous sentence be false then 4 be actually true however the context identify it as another false   or at least theologically unsound   statement 5 by the way I enjoy science on the evidence Mr. Rawlins lack sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense one might just as well say that one enjoy literature write in a language that one can not read however one can not mark this sentence as false to follow the analogy perhaps he like the pretty shape of the letter 6 it be truly a wonder observe god 's creation let we not quibble- count this one as true 7 macroevolution be a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion   guarantee within three percent error   still another false statement however one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification Macroevolution as misunderstood by Rawline be a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously think of as science and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously think of as religion it be distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fail miserably to touch on truth except when he report personally on what he feel   I do he the justice of assume that he be not misinform we as to his personal reaction   one can account for this by the hypothesis that he have an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth;3

159;    I think you 're let atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of WEBSTER myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth be accept uncritically how do that qualify indeed it 's almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance I 've find that most atheist hold almost no atheist view as accept uncritically especially the few that be legend many be try to explain basic truth as myth do but they do n't meet the other criterion Andrew the myth to which I refer be the convoluted counterfeit athiest have create to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion include Christainity in a rational manner and debate its claim -as the be stated- atheist concoct outrageous parody and then hold the religious accountable for belief they do n't have what be more accurately oxymoric be the a term like reasonable atheist Bill   divine justice accord to the most fundamental doctrine of   Christianity when the first man sin he be at that time the you accuse he of reference mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meet all the requirement of myth Here be a good example of of what I say above read the post again I say acoorde to which mean I be refer to christian doctrine as I understand it if I be speak for myself you 'll know it my purpose in posting be to present a basic overview of Christain doctrine since it seem germane Bill   with those who pretend not to know what be be say and what it   mean when atheist claim that they do -not- know if God exist and   do n't know what he want they contradict the Bible which clearly say   that -everyone- know the authority of the Bible be its claim to be should I repeat what I write above for the sake of get it across you may trust the Bible but your trust it does n't make it any more credible to I if the Bible say that everyone know that 's clearly reason to doubt the Bible because not everyone know your alleged god 's allege existance again I be paraphrase christian doctrine which be very clear on this point your dispute be not with I Bill   refute while the species wide condemnation be justify those that   claim that there be no evidence for the existence of God or that his will be   unknown must deliberately ignore the Bible- the ignorance itself be   no excuse 1 no they do n't have to ignore the Bible the Bible be far from universally accept the Bible be not a proof of god- it be only a proof that some people have think that there be a god or do it prove even that they might have be write it as series of fiction short story as in the case of Dionetics assume the writer believe it the only thing it could possibly prove be that they believe it and that be ignore the problem of whether or not all the interpretation and Biblical philosopher be correct 2 there be people who have truly never hear of the Bible 3 again read the FAQ 1 here again you miss the point the Bible itself be not the point it 's what it contain it make no difference who accpet the Bible or even who 's unaware of its existence Christians hold that it apply universally because mankind share the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of God 2 see above 3 if you read my post with same care as read the FAQ we would n't be have this conversation Bill   freedom you be free to ignore God in the same way you be free to   ignore gravity and the consequence be inevitable and well know   in both case that an atheist ca n't accept the evidence mean only Bzzt wrong answer gravity be directly there it does n't stop exert a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it God on the other hand does n't generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloid God does n't exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity be obvious- god are n't as I say the evidence be there you just do n't accept it here at least we agree Bill   secondly human reason be very comforatble with the concept of God so   much so that it be in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason   always come back to the question of God in every generation and in no human reason has n't always come back to the existance of god- it have usually come back to the existance of god in other word it does n't generally come back to the xtian god it come back to whether there be any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally does n't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural force be and which one be out there from a world wide view human nature just make we wonder how the universe come to be andor what force(s be currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in God only exist in religious wishful think yes human reason do always come back to the existence of God we 're have this discussion be we not Bill   I say all this to make the point that Christianity be eminently   reasonable that Divine justice be just and human nature be much   different than what atheist think it be whether you agree or not you certainly be not correct on human nature you be at the least base your view on a completely eurocentric approach try look at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity well this be interesting Truth be to be determine by it politically correct content grant it 's extremely unhip to be a WASP male and anything european be contemptable but I think this kind of dialogue the purpose of a.a be to get at the truth of thing but then I remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and I understand;0

CERL it be a popular geographic and remote sense image processing package many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image processing package although it be report to have significant image processing capability Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it 's public domain and can be obtain through the internet for free GRASS run in Unix and be write in C. the source code can be obtain through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass Integration you then compile the source code for your machine use script provide with GRASS I would recommend GRASS for someone who already have a workstation and be on a limited budget GRASS be not very user friendly compare to Macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicate that it look useful and have some pixel resample function not in other package plus good general purpose image enhancement routine fft Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in Boulder CO be a primary user of GRASS this gentleman have use the GRASS software and developed multi spectral 238 band volumetric rendering full color on Suns and Stardents it be a really effective interface Vexcel Corp. currently have a contract to map

run A   UX you could install GRASS on a Macintosh which have significant image analysis and import capability for satellite datum GRASS be public domain and can run on a high end pc under UNIX it be raster base have some image processing capability and can display vector datum but analysis must be do in the raster environment I have use GRASS v.3 on a SUN workstation and find it easy to use it be

range of gis software   hardware microstation be a base graphic package that Imager sit on top of Imager be basically an image processing package with a heavy GIS   remote sense flavor Feature Description basic geometry manipulation flip mirror rotate generalize affine rectification Affine 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th order model as well as a projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image RGB to IHS and ihs to RGB conversion Principal component analysis classification k mean and isodata Fourier Xforms forward filtering and reverse filter high pass low pass edge enhancing median generic Complex Histogram   Contrast control Layer Controller manage up to 64 image at a time user can extract single band from a 3 band image or create color image by combine various individual band etc the package be design for a remote sense application it can handle very large image and there be all kind of other software available for gis application Host Configuration Requirements it run on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun though there be rumor there be always rumor that the software would be port to pc and possibly a Sun environment PCI a company call PCI Inc. out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada make an array of software utility for processing manipulation and use of remote sense datum in eight or ten different industry standard format LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of other whose title I forget the software be available in version for MS DOS Unix workstation among they HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly other platform by now I use the VMS version the PCI software consist of several class   group   package of utility group by function but all operate on a common pci database disk file the Tape I   o package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote sense industry tape format INTO or write those format out from the PCI database file- this be the only package I use or know much about other package can display datum from the PCI database to one or another of several pci support third party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image datum to an attached printer e.g. an Epson type dot matrix graphic printer you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operation package histo- gram and Fourier analysis equalization user specify operation e.g. multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and God only know what all else there 's a LOT I do n't have and do n't use these so ca n't say much about them- you only buy the package your particular application   interest call for each utility be control by from one to eight parameter read from a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default directory some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing set up a series of operation the standard PCI environment contain a scripting language very similar to IBM pc BASIC but which allow you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in VMS I can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure There 's also an optional programming library which allow you to write compile language program which can interface with read from   write to the PCI datum structure database file parameter file the PCI software be design specifically for remote sense image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing as well for instance the Tape I   o package offer a utility for read headerless multi band what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh call raw datum from tape in a number of different interleave order this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic art industry 's CT2 T format would probably I have n't try handle Targa and so on above all however you have to know what YOU'RE do or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over It 's worth note that the PCI database file be design to contain not only raster image datum but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land use and all manner of other information I observe that a remote sense image tape often contain all manner of information about the spectral band latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass- all of this can go into the PCI database I   believe   that on workstation the build in display be use on VAX system other than workstation pci support only a couple of specific third party display system the name Gould   Deanza seem to come to mind one of MY personal workaround be a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a Peritek VCT Q Q bus 24 bit DirectColor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case- it seems design for the very high end application   user i.e. those for whom a Mac   PC largely does n't suffice although as you know the gap be get small all the time It 's probably no coincidence that PCI be locate in Canada a country which do a LOT of its land   resource management via remote sensing- I believe the canadian government use PCI software for some of its work in these area SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager back in 1985 JPL develop something call SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager which get a fair amount of use at the time that be design for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery byte datum    256 pixel across by    512 line by    256 bands)- a modify version have since be develop for AVIRIS Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer which use much large image Spam do none of these thing rectification classification pc and IHS transformation filtering contrast enhancement overlay actually it do limit filtering and contrast enhancement stretching Spam be aim at spectral identification and clustering the original Spam

1025;  Rick Anderson reply to my letter with    ra   in article   C5ELp2.L0Cacsu.buffalo.edu     ra     just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to   differ interpretation of create and say that many Christians may   not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base our faith   on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line be   truth regardless of popularity of opinion it may be irrelevant to you and   your   personal belief or should I say bias but it be relevant to I and many other You 're right the bottom line be truth independant from you or anyone else since you proclaim truth as a self proclaim appointee may I ask you by what authority you do this because it say so in the Bible --doe the Bible say so or be it you or someone else who interpret whether a scripture or doctrine conform to your particular liking or disapproval Excuse moi but your line of truth have n't move I one bit to persuade I that my belief be erroneous of all the preacher of truth on this net you have strike I as a self righteous member of the wreck crew with no positive message to I or other latter day saint whatsoever BTW this entire discussion remind I a lot of the thing say by Jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrite(s ye preach about I with your lip but your heart be far removed from I   also I find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create   and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the Mormon   belief you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to   have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to address   and answer the point that be raise and not just jump to the   conclusion that you grant Sophistry look who 's talking jump to conclusion you would n't do that yourself right all you address be your own conviction regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of view because you reject such interpretation without any consideration whatsoever    the Bible state that Lucifer be create the Bible state that Jesus   be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the LDS   belief be that Jesus and Lucifer be the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine the former KGB would have love to employ you Jesus and lucifer be not the same silly and you know it   the Mormon belief be that all be child of God literally there be   nothing symbolic about it this however contradict what the Bible   say the Bible teach that not everyone be a child of God Correction it may contradict would you think the Bible say the Bible indeed do teach that not all be child of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in his footstep Satan and his follower have rebel against God and be not child follower   redeem of God but it does n't mean that they be not once create by God but choose to separate themselves from those who choose to follow God and his plan of salvation    the field be the world- the good seed be the child of the   kingdom- but the tare be the child of the wicked one-   Matthew 13:38 kingdom be those who have remain valiant in their testimony of Jesus and have show work of repentance etc and the child of the wicked one be those who rebel against God and the lamb the issue of satan 's spirit offspring and those who follow he have not be address in this and

doctrine of the lds that I have mention portray a vastly   ra    different Jesus a Jesus that can not be reconcile with the Jesus of   ra    the Bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim Correction my Jesus be indeed different than your Jesus and can be reconcile with the Jesus in the Bible --not your interpretation of Him I concur but I honestly could n't care less   ra    one as be true deny the other from be true accord to the   ra    Bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true God and   ra    not the construct of imagination in this single posting of your i 've see more construct of imagination than in all of the pro lds mail combine I have read so far in this news group first get your lds fact straight before you dare preach to we about the only true God whom you interpret accord to your own like and dislike but whose image I can not reconcile with what I know about he myself I guess your grandiose self image do not allow for other faith believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ but in a different way or fashion than your own not that it really matter the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progress until it have visit every continent sweep every clime and sound in every ear   this be really a red herring it does n't address any issue raise but   rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read   something into the Bible does n't change what the Bible teach Sigh what the Bible teach or what the bible teach accord to Robert Weiss and co.

92;well here go the first item of business be to establish the importance space life science in the whole of scheme of humankind I mean compare to football and baseball the average joe schmoe does n't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education all of we in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be release to the general public around the world the document would scientifically analyze the technical aspect of long term human habitation in space I believe that if any long term space exploration program be to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld i.e. the spacecraft only through the careful analysis of engineering chemical biological and medical factor will a good ecosystem be create to facilitate human life on a long duration flight so I would like to see post of opinion regard the most objective method to analyze the accept scientific literature for technology which can be apply to long duration spaceflight such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocate and clearly important to exist space program in essence we would be divide the space life science issue into various technical problem which could be solve with various technology this database of acceptable solution to various problem could form the basis of detailed discussion involve people from the bionet isunet and any other source;2
292;where do it say in the bible that Christians be suppose to persecute Jews Is n't it love your enemy instead they may say they be christian but do their action speak differently do you believe what everyone tell you I do n't I come to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusion and ultimately by my own choice Salvation however be grant only through the grace of God to be a Christian be to model oneself after Jesus Christ as imply by the very name Christian if you say you believe in your head but do not feel in your heart what do that say of your belief white supremist and Neo Nazis be not any brand of Christian if you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you can not see what do this belief entail believe in Christ and have your sin forgive in his name do not give a Christian a free licence to sin to repent of a sin be to ask forgiveness of that sin and try not to do it again I be a Christian but if you lump I in with racist and accuse I of be such then be you not pre judge I BTW I be of chinese racial background and I know what it be to be part of a visible minority in this country I do n't think that I would be favourably look upon by these White supremist Christians as you call they anyone can say what they believe but if they do n't practice what they preach then their belief be false do you concur Nazis and racist in general be the one that come to my immediate attention what I believe be that such people may be use the bible to mask their racial intolerance and bigotry they can do as they do and hide behind Christianity but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with they no arguement there the only point I 'm try to make be that those who call themselves Christian may not be Christian I ask that you draw your own conclusion by what they do and what they say if they be not model after the example of Jesus Christ then they be not Christian if they have not repent of their sin and accept Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they be not Christian these be the only criterion to be a Christian may God be with you;3

1924;Yep that be pretty much it I 'm not a Jew but I understand that this be the jewish way of thinking however the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs Abraham and Moses in this case establish a Moral Code to follow for mankind even the Jews could not decide where the boundary fall though as I understand it the Sadducees believe that the Torah be all that be require whereas the Pharisees the ancestor of modern Judaism believe that the Torah be available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the require Morality in all its nuance -Talmud the essence of all of this be that Biblical Morality be an interface between Man and yhwh for a Jew or Christian and do not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship although one can speculate the trouble with all of this be that we do n't really know what the create in his image mean I 've hear a number of different opinion on this and have still not come to any conclusion this rather upset the Apple Cart if one want to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphor unashamedly as to live by Christ 's example we know very little about Jesus as a person we only have his record utterance in a set of narrative by his follower and some very small reference from comtemporary historian Revelation aside one can only know Christ second hand or bad this be not an attempt to debunk Christianity although it may seem that way initially the point i m try to make be that we only really have the Bible to interpret and that interpretation be by humanity I guess this be where Faith or relevation come in with all its inherent subjectiveness no there may be an absolute moral code there be undoubtably multiple moral code the multiple moral code may be found in the absolute moral code as an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swear simply because the parent have tell the child that it be wrong now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there be no child the wrongness here be if the child disobey the parent the parent may feel that it be inappropriate to swear in front of child but may be quite happy to swear in front of animal the analogy do not quite hold water because the child know that he be of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it incidentally the young child consider the directive as absolute until he get old see Piaget and learn a morality of his own David on religion;3

929;in article   C5Mw03.9qrdarkside.osrhe.uoknor.edu   bilokcforum.osrhe.edu   i 'd say that what one choose to observe and how the observation be   interpret and what significance it 's give depend a great deal on   the value of the observer science be a human activity and as such   be subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human   activity the myth that scientist be above moral influence or   ethical concern that their knowledge can be abstacte whole and pure   from nature untainted by the bias of the scientist be nonsense bill this be wonderfully phrased I assume you understand that your statement be also undermine such human construct as religion as well Kent I 'll accept this as a compliment although I 'm always a little paranoid when visit a.a thank yes I do know the extent of the statement relevence it 's what I think of as human nature I 'm not sure it undermine either religion or atheism since both claim special knowledge about the truth and since such claim be always suspect all we can learn from it be that human be a very arrogant specie my point be that we can not ignore human nature when examine human claim the trick here then be to find some way to abstract our infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality be out there so we can see what there be to see I can think of no way this can be do;0

888;I hope I did n't award custody Rich I purposely use handle in order to avoid do so i.e. that happen to be what religion do of course there be aberration like scientific creationism I use well in part to indicate that science currently have a time of it with why and who so these domain be mostly ignore I also attempt to be brief which no doubt confuse the matter as an aside for science I should have write how and when nobody seem to argue over what seem to I that the answer would vary from individual to individual I 'm not try to be evasive on this but from a societal perspective religion work on the other hand sometimes it be abuse and misuse and many suffer which you know but the net result seem positive this from the anthropological perspective on human affair you might call I a neo fruedian insofar as I think the masse ca n't get along without religion not that generally they be incapable- they just do n't and for myriad reason but the main one seem to be the promise of immortality very seductive that immortality therefore it seem that theologian be well equipped than the other you mention for dispense answer to who and why I suggest that this hold regardless of the truth in their answer to who and why simply because people believe in the end spiritual belief be just as real as scientific fact and explanation caution to some do not take this out of context no in fact I do n't think it be close now at least for some individual Is n't there a group of theoretical physicist who argue that matter be create from nothing in a Big Bang singularity this approach might presuppose an absence of who and why except that it seem it could be argue that something have to be responsible for nothing maybe that something does n't have to be supernatural maybe just mechanistic but that be a tough one for people today to grasp in any case theory without empirical datum be not explanation but then your question do not require datum in other word I agree that theorize within scientific parameter be just as scientific as explain so the answer be who and why be not close to scientist but I sense that science in these realm be currently very inadequate datum will be necessary for improvement and that seem a long way off if ever Pretty convoluted here- I hope I 've make sense I agree generally but I prefer to put it this way the   question   of how when who and why be not open to inquiry during the Enlightenment reason be reponsible for question the theological answer to how and when and not for the most part who and why Science be thus bear out of the naturalists curiosity eventually cart away the how and when while largely leave behind the who and why the ignorant the selfish the intolerant and the arrogant of course still claim authority in all four domain much oblige Funny how fact tend to muddle thing is n't it well I be sure there be plenty of scientific creationist rebuttal out there somewhere even if they have to be create from nothing   just for the record again AMH   anatomically modern human   Best regard;3
1910;for an essay I be write about the space shuttle and a need for a well propulsion system through research I have find that it be rather clumsy i.e. all the check   test before launch the safety hazard sit on a hydrogen bomb etc if you have any beef about the current space shuttle program re propulsion please send I your idea thank a lot;2
532;-jeremy be you talk about a single BATSE component or the whole thing you   could   propose a BATSE probe- launch two or three with ion drive on various planetary trajectory your resolution increace the more they 're space apart you could probably cheaply eject they from the solar system with enough flyby and patience thing would start out slow then slowly get well and well resolution;2
1509;the same way that any theory be prove false you examine the predicition that the theory make and try to observe they if you do n't or if you observe thing that the theory predict would n't happen then you have some evidence against the theory if the theory ca n't be modify to incorporate the new observation then you say that it be false for example people use to believe that the earth have be create 10,000 year ago but as evidence show that prediction from this theory be not true it be abandon;3
1008;sorry Fred but for the purpose under discussion here I must disagree your point be true only in the sense that one can not argue against communism by reference to the chinese or soviet empire since those do not represent   true   communism in judge the practical consequence of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today it be precisely the Khomeini 's of the world the Rushdie fatwa supporter and perhaps more importantly the reaction of the world muslim community to those extremist that we must look to perhaps unfortunately from your perspective most people be not concerned with whether Islam be the right religion for they or whether the Qur'an could be use as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia but how Islam affect the world around they or what their life might be like if Islam gain in influence when I consider such possibility it be with not inconsiderable fear;0
990;certainly reference follow Bear in mind that there be at least two condition which may be call red   green colour blind one protanopia be cause by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cone those that respond well to long wavelength this give much reduce red   green and red   violet discrimination and also mean that red look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision the other deuteranopia be due to miss or dysfunctional M cone although it can also be cause by a lack of the L M cone difference signal in the retina it also give reduce red   green discrimination but red   violet be unaffected unlike protanopia red be not dimmer than normal on a uniform chromaticity diagram the horseshoe shape one you see in computer graphic book there be a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency colour which be confused lie on straight line radiate from this point for protanopia the point be at u'0.61,v'0.51 very close to the far red corner for deuteranopia the point be at u'-4.75 v'1.31 note that different experimental investigation in the literature give slightly different value for these depend on the precise detail of the experimental setup random error and so on the value quote be typical so if all colour on a line be see as the same which colour be actually see this problem have now be solve test on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have show that there be an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colour collapse for protanope this join up 473 nm and 574 nm on the spectral locus the edge of the horseshoe)- for deuteranope the line be very similar join 477 nm and 579 nm   so   to convert colour from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia 1 plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2 construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3 find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4 this be the new chromaticity the good reference for this be Meyer G.W.   Greenberg D.P. 1988 colour defective vision and computer graphic displays IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8(5 28 40 you will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you be not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram yes this be certainly possible you will need the chromaticity of the red green and blue phosphor of the monitor you intend to display the image on and the chromaticity of the white point this information can be measure or obtain from the manufacturer I post a list of some monitor chromaticity a couple of week ago the procedure for each pixel be as follow some lookup table might be a help here A convert RGB to CIE XYZ this be a simple 3   3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor datum b retain the Y component for later convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinate u'v use u   4x(x15y3z v   9y(x15y3z c find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D find the intersection as in step 3 e convert back from u'v to XYZ use the Y value from step A f ensure that this new colour can be display on your monitor- if not move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey ie half way between black and white until it be displayable Done- also post for the rest of we Chris Lilley Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road Manchester UK M13 9pl internet c.c.lilleymcc.ac.uk voice 44 0)61 275 6045 fax 44 0)61 275 6040 Janet C.C.Lilleyuk.ac.mcc;1

1653;  Moral Driver distinction delete   compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy where there be an urge and an object the jealousy do not technically exist until the object be apparent however the capacity to be jealous be presumably still there even though it be not detectable your description of the Unbilical take I three pass to understand but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree I think our two definition can sit side by side without too much trouble though I have n't attempt to define the reason behind the Moral Driver only hint through the essence of each Moral your definition hint that animal be also capable of a similar morality Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it be easy to anthropomorphize with these animal be this possible or have I misunderstood my p.s thought fall roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writing on Utilitarianism I have no particular plan except to do my bit personal ethic and social work my opinion for what it be worth be that the Authority for each Moral must be increase somehow and that this will probably take several generation to be effective I do n't think that the list of Morals have change for Society significantly though the Authority element may come from our authority figure and role model see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work    Mavis Klein   for reference and this be what give rise to a deterioration of moral standard in the long term I 've have some more thought on my definition I 've be think that I should add Moral Character to the list of definition in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature ie the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities a suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system the Moral Nature be the set of frequency and the choose amplitudes and the Moral Character be the spectrum over time Conscience be a little more difficult because I ca n't define it as the reasoning of a person between action in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seem to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted I think Conscience be manifest when a decision be make at a give time which compromise one 's Moral Nature my Conscience fit in more with Freud 's SuperEgo plus the Moral Driver with the stimulous be the urge or Freud 's Id. the reasoning that I mention before be Freud 's ego I suppose if the Moral Driver be part of the I d then the reason why Conscience cut in unbidden be partially explain the question be what provide the stimulous to activate the Moral driver I think I need some more time with this one That 's about it for now David on religion;3
391;deletion rest delete That be a fallacy and it be not the first time it be point out for one you have never give a set of moral people agree upon unlike a football far you conveniently ignore here that there be many who would not agree on tghe morality of something the analogy do not hold one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its be a football while you have to give the evidence that only vanish number disagree with a set of moral you have to give far the above be evidence not proof Proof would evolve out of test your theory of absolute moral against compete theory;0

1631;seem like a lot of trouble to go to its probably well to invest in new launch system I do n't think a big cost advantage for use russian system will last for very long maybe a few year Lockheed would be the place to ask since you would probably have to buy the Proton from they they market the Proton world wide except Russia they should know a lot about the possibility I have n't hear they propose US launch so I assume they look into it and find it unprofitable yes comparable to the Zenit I suppose but since it look like nothing will be build there you might just as well pick any spot the message be to launch now while its cheap and while Russia and Kazakstan be still cooperate later the story may be different;2

433;  my stuff delete   Bill you seem to have erroneously assume that this board have as its sole purpose the validation of atheism it does n't this board be use to discuss atheism as a philosophy to share posters experience regard atheism to debunk various theism and theism as a whole to share resource relate to atheism and even to socialize with other with similar view and of course with the number of theist who come here to preach it be also use to argue the case for atheism if you want to accuse people of lie please do so directly the phrase deliberately mistaken be rather oxymoronic the two form of theism most often discuss here these day be Christianity and Islam both of these claim to make their follower into good people and claim that much of benefit to humanity have be accomplish through their faith IMHO they be right the American Friends Service Committee Quaker Catholic Relief Services Bread for the World Salvation Army soup kitchen and Mother Theresa spring to mind can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the name of some analagous islamic group when Mother Theresa claim that her work be an outgrowth of her christianity I believe she her form of theism ascribe to her deity such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care for those in need the point be that such a philosophy do have the power to change the behavior of individuals- if it be widespread enough it can change society the same work for the horror of history to claim that Christianity have little to do with the Crusades or the inquisition be to deny the awesome power that come from faith in an absolute what it seem you be do twist the reasonable statement that religion be never the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that religion have have no evil impact on history that be absurd;0

424;  reply to frankD012S658.uucp Frank o'dwyer   from a Dictionary of Philosophy by Anthony Flew objectivism the belief that there be certain moral truth that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone think or desire for instance No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be think of as a plausible example even in a world of sadist who all reject it the contention remain true just as 5   7   12 remain correct even if there be no one leave to count the problem for the objectivist be to determine the status of moral truth and the method by which they can be establish if we accept that such judgement be not report of what be but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they can not be prove by any fact about the nature of the world nor can they be analytic since this would involve lack of action guide content- One ought always to do the right thing be plainly true in virtue of the vord involve but it be unhelpful as a practical guide to action see analytic and synthetic at this point the objectivist may talk of self evident truths but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self evidence be in the mind of the beholder if not what be leave of the claim that some moral judgement be true the subjectivist may well feel that all that remain be that there be some moral judgement with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion be he suggest not to know something to be true but to have preference regard human activity;0

100;this be a good point but I think average people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their social life or to get more involved with american culture if they be kid of immigrant for example since it be the overwhelming major religion in the Western World in some form or other it be simply the choice people take if they be bored and want to do something new with their life but not somethong too new or TOO out of the ordinary seem a little weak but as long as it does n't hurt anybody these be good quote and I agree with both of they but let 's make sure to alter the scond one so that include something like let he be as long as he be not prevent other from find their peace or something like that of course I suppose if someone be REALLY at peace there would be no need for inflict evangelism well it be a sure thing we will have to live with they all our life their popularity seem to come and go I remember when I first enter High School I be an atheist always have be and so be about 7 of my friend at this time 5 of those 7 have convert always to Christianity they be all also immigrant from Taiwan or son of immigrant hence my early gross generalization Christianity seem a lot more popular to people now than it ever have before since I 've be notice maybe it be just my perception that be chagne who know I for one be perfectly willing to live and let live with they so long as we have some set of abstract right   agreement on how we should treat each other I have no desire to be hurt by they or their notion for all the well put argument on this usenet it never do any good argumentation do not really seem to apply to Christians or even some atheists)- it must simply be a step the person take naturally almost instinctively good regard                                                                                   Adam John cooperttverily often have I laugh at the weakling    tttt who think themselves good simply because    acoopermacalstr.eduttttthey have no claws.t                                                                                  ;0

1713;That 's right and this be pretty impossible right it would be ideal if we could believe for a while just to try out religion and only then determine which course of thought suit we well but again this be not possible not that religion warrant belief but the belief carry with it some psychological benefit there be also some psychological burden too well if there be some psychological or other benefit gain from racism they could only be fully understand or judge by person actually believe in racism of course the parallel happen to be a poor one but you originate it;0

1329;stuff delete I reiterate that I would agree with you that there be little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an in islamic history as well apostasy have rarely be punish Belief be consider a matter of conscience and since there be to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostate have be generally leave to believe or not believe as they will however when an apostate make attack upon God and his Messenger the situation change now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charge perhaps charge of sedition treason spying etc if the person make a public issue of their apostasy or mount public attack as oppose to arguement against Islam the situation be likewise complicated if the person spread slander or broadcast falsehood again the situation change the punishment vary accord to the situation the apostate be in anyhow the charge of aggravate apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie 's case there be a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and be in the situation where someone unilaterally wage war by their action create disorder make mischief etc against the Muslims and create a situation that result in harm to Muslims here a small group or even a single individual could be say to be engage in such a practise in other word there be a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly define party wage war conclude treaty exchange prisoner etc and deal with attack that come from isolated individual or group against Islam it be the second situation the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that would apply in the case of Rushdie the matter of Rushdie be not a simple matter of ban an offensive book ban the book be secondary a full set of circumstance follow the publication of the book come into play as well include the death of many Muslims and Rushdie 's and his publisher medium game I be not sure which hadith you be refer to above I believe that one of the qur'anic verse on which the fatwa be base be 5:33 every verse in the Qur'an have a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way be the understanding the tafsir of the verse restrict solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it be reveal if this be the case then we could say that all the law and regulation that be reveal when the Muslims be not involve in conflict should be suspend when they be at war the logic do not follow in complex real life situation there may be many verse and many hadith which can all be relate to a single complicated situation the internal relationship between these verse may be quite complex such that arrive at an understanding of how the verse interlock and how each apply to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task it be not necessarily a simple this or that process there may be many parameter involve there may be a large context in which a particular situation should be view all these matter impinge on the situation in other word there be a great deal involve in decipher the Qur'an the qur'an ask we to reflect on its verse but this reflection must entail more than simply read a verse and its corresponding hadith if the reflection be for the sake of increase personal piety then each person have his own level of understanding and there be no harm in that however if the reflection be in order to decide matter that pertain to the State to the gestation of law and ruling to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there be certain minimum requirement of understand that one should achieve Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as Sadiq(a.s relate some of these requirement as teach by the Prophet(S.A. in a hadith he who do not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous- and do not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and do not recognize a verse of meccan period from a Medinite one and do not know the circumstance of revelation and do not understand the technical word of the Qur'an whether simple or compound)- and do not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and be ignorant of advance and delay in its verses)- and do not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination- and be unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exception and the all inclusive and be ignorant of an adjective of a precede noun that explain the subsequent one- and be unaware of the emphasize subject and the detailed one the obligatory law and the permission the place of the duty and rule and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful- and do not know the joined word and the word that be relate to those come before they or after they then such a man do not know the Qur'an- nor be he among the people of the Qur'an base on these and other hadith and in accordance with many qur'anic verse why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn people when they return to they so that they may beware 9:122 a science of jurisprudence arise the requirement for a person to be consider a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matter of law and religion be many I 've list a few major division below there be of course many subdivision within these heading Knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation root semantic oratory Knowledge of tafsir and principle of tafsir Logic mantiq a knowledge of Hadiths A knowledge of transmitter rijal Knowledge of the principle of juriprudence Qur'an Sunnah Consensus Reasoning the study of Qur'an and sunnah for purpose of law involve discussion of imperative

abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogate the principle of application of the law involve principle of exemption principle of precaution principle of option principle of mastery the jurisprudent be bind to go through a very rigorous process in pronounce judgement on a give situation it be not a matter of look at one verse and one hadith now no one should blindly follow anyone but there be a difference between blind follow and accede to the opinion of someone who be clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself there be the the fuqaha religious scholar be the trustee of the Prophet as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desire pleasure and wealth of this world the Prophet S.A. be ask o Messenger of God how may we know if they so concern themselves he S.A. reply by see whether they follow the rule power if they do that fear for your religion and shun they I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhab to comment on how this hadith apply to they or to the contemporary scholar who base themselves upon they the Prophet also refer to the fuqaha as the fortress of Islam my only point be to make it clear that arrive at a legal judgement call into play a certain amount of expertise the specific of this expertise be delineate in the Qur'an and hadith those who acquire this expertise be praise in both the Qur'an and hadith those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matter that affect society state and religion be caution the only reason I say anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group be because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that be apostasy be wrong when one discuss something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly Khomeini be condemn as a heretic because he supposedly claim to be infallible another instance of create a straw man and then beat he I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup

1990;  Rick Anderson reply to my letter with    ra   in article   C5ELp2.L0Cacsu.buffalo.edu     ra     just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to   differ interpretation of create and say that many Christians may   not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base our faith   on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line be   truth regardless of popularity of opinion it may be irrelevant to you and   your   personal belief or should I say bias but it be relevant to I and many other You 're right the bottom line be truth independant from you or anyone else since you proclaim truth as a self proclaim appointee may I ask you by what authority you do this because it say so in the Bible --doe the Bible say so or be it you or someone else who interpret whether a scripture or doctrine conform to your particular liking or disapproval Excuse moi but your line of truth have n't move I one bit to persuade I that my belief be erroneous of all the preacher of truth on this net you have strike I as a self righteous member of the wreck crew with no positive message to I or any other latter day Saint BTW this entire discussion remind I a lot of the thing say by Jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrite(s ye preach about I with your lip but your heart be far removed from I   also I find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create   and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the Mormon   belief you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to   have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to address   and answer the point that be raise and not just jump to the   conclusion that you grant Sophistry look who 's talking jump to conclusion you would n't do that yourself right all you address be your own conviction regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of view because you reject such interpretation without any consideration whatsoever    the Bible state that Lucifer be create the Bible state that Jesus   be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the LDS   belief be that Jesus and Lucifer be the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine the former KGB would have love to employ you Jesus and lucifer be not the same silly and you know it   the Mormon belief be that all be child of God literally there be   nothing symbolic about it this however contradict what the Bible   say the Bible teach that not everyone be a child of God Correction it may contradict would you think the Bible say the Bible indeed do teach that not all be child of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in his footstep Satan and his follower have rebel against God and be not child follower   redeem of God but it does n't mean that they be not once create by God but choose to separate themselves from those who choose to follow God and his plan of salvation    the field be the world- the good seed be the child of the   kingdom- but the tare be the child of the wicked one-   Matthew 13:38 kingdom be those who have remain valiant in their testimony of Jesus and have show work of repentance etc and the child of the wicked one be those who rebel against God and the lamb the issue of satan 's spirit origin and of those who follow he have not be address in this and other verse you copy from your Bible you purposefully obscure the subject by swamp your right with non- relate scripture lot of nice scripture delete not Robert W. copyright though   ra    we be tell that and this be life eternal that they might know   ra    thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast send   ra    John 17:3 life eternal be to know the only true God yet the   ra    doctrine of the lds that I have mention portray a vastly   ra    different Jesus a Jesus that can not be reconcile with the Jesus of   ra    the Bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim Correction my Jesus be indeed different than your Jesus and can be reconcile with the Jesus in the Bible --not your interpretation of Him I concur but I honestly could n't care less   ra    one as be true deny the other from be true accord to the   ra    Bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true God and   ra    not the construct of imagination in this single posting of your i 've see more construct of imagination than in all of the pro lds mail combine I have read so far in this news group first get your lds fact straight before you dare preach to we about the only true God whom you interpret accord to your own like and dislike but whose image I can not reconcile with what I know about he myself I guess your grandiose self image do not allow for other faith believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ but in a different way or fashion than your own not that it really matter the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progress until it have visit every continent sweep every clime and sound in every ear   this be really a red herring it does n't address any issue raise but   rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read   something into the Bible does n't change what the Bible teach Sigh what the Bible teach or what the bible teach accord to Robert Weiss and co. I respect the former I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have reject Jesus on the contrary and by the way I do respect your interpretation of the Bible I even grant you be a Christian follow your own image of Him as much as I be a Christian follow my own image of he in my heart   Most of the other reply have instead hop scotch to the issue of   Bruce McConkie and whether his view be official doctrine I do n't   think that it matter if McConkie 's view be canon that be not the   issue be McConkie 's writing indicative of Mormon belief on this   subject be the real issue the indication from Rick be that they may   certainly be the issue be of course that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church the issue of official doctrine be obviously very important McConkie 's view have be controversial e.g. the Seven Deadly Heresies have make I a heretic at good or erroneous at bad black not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation I respect he as someone who have make his valuable contribution to the church but I personally do not rely on his personal interpretation his book Mormon Doctrine be oftentime refer to as McConkie 's Bible in mormon circle on mormon doctrine I rather look to official doctrinal source and to Hugh Nibley 's book the last comment be an lds insider reference Summarizing McConkie be a wise man who contribute undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have but whose view be by no means dogma or accept doctrine some of it clearly belong to personal interpretation and speculation but having say this I find McConkie even in his most biased and speculative moment far more thought provoking than the trash come from your proverbial pen I 'm somewhat appalled that I have allow myself to sink as low as you in this posting                               Robert Weiss psyrobtwubvms.cc.buffalo.edu;3

677;hi everyone I think that some people may be interested in my VR software on these group         announce the release of Multiverse-1.0.2         multiverse be a multi user non immersive X Windows base virtual Reality system primarily focus on entertainment   research feature Client Server base model use Berkeley Sockets no limit to the number of user apart from performance generic client customizable server Hierachical Objects allow attachment of camera and light source multiple light source ambient point and spot object can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attach Functionality Client the client be build around a fast render loop basically it change thing when tell to by the server and then render an image from the user 's viewpoint it also provide the server with information about the user 's action which can then be communicate to other client and therefore to other user the client be design to be generic in other word you do n't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this mean that resource can be spend on enhance the client software rather than adapt it the adaptation as will be explain in a moment occur in the server this release of the client software support the following functionality o Hierarchical Objects with associated addressing o Multiple Light Sources and Types Ambient Point and Spot o User Interface Panels o Colour Polygonal render with Phong Shading optional wireframe for tfaster frame rate o Mouse and Keyboard Input some people may be disappoint that this software does n't support the PowerGlove as an input device this be not because it ca n't but because I do n't have one this will however be one of the first enhancement server(s this be where customization can take place the follow basic support be provide in this release for potential world server developer o Transparent Client Management o Client Message Handling this may not sound like much but it take away the headache of accept and terminate client and receive message from they the application writer can work with the assumption that thing be happen locally thing get more interesting in the object extension functionality this be what be provide to allow you to animate your object o Server Selectable Extension Installation what this mean be that you can decide which object have extend functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialiser you want o Event Handler Registration when you develop extension for an object you basically write callback function for the event that you want the object to respond to current event support INIT MOVE CHANGE COLLIDE   TERMINATE o Collision Detection Registration if you want your object to respond to collision event just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activate when a collision occur this software be keep separate from the worldserver application because the application developer want to build a library of extended object from which to choose the follow be all you need to make a World Server application o provide an initworld function this be where you choose what object extension will be support plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this be where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobject function this be where you load the world .wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this be where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this be where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the object move by call a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrun the client That be all there be to it and to prove it here be the line count for the three world server i 've provide generic 81 line dactyl 270 line more complicated collision detection due to the stair will probably be improve with future version dogfight 72 line Location this software be locate at the follow site ftp.u.washington.edu Directory pub   virtual world File multiverse-1.0.2.tar Z Futures Client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i.e. Z Buffering or similar Gouraud shade o HMD support o etc etc Server o Physical Modelling gravity friction etc o Enhanced Object Management   Interaction o etc etc both o Improved Comms I hope this provide people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software unfortunately it come with practically zero documentation and I 'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectify I hope people enjoy this software and that it be useful in our exploration of the virtual Universe I 've certainly find fascinating develop it and I would   LOVE   to add support for the PowerGlove and an HMD finally one major disclaimer this be totally amateur code by that I mean there be no support for this code other than what I out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide I can not be hold responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it AT your OWN risk Disclaimer over of course if you love it I would like to here from you and anyone with POSITIVE contribution   criticism be also encourage to contact I anyone who hate it   dev   null                                                                                   and if anyone want to let I do this for a living you know where to write                                                                                   thank Robert;1

Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe which he call the Reciprocal System be build on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe be compose ENTIRELY of one component MOTION exist in three dimension in DISCRETE unit and in two RECIPROCAL form SPACE and TIME 2 the physical universe conform to the relation of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematic its magnitude be ABSOLUTE and its geometry be EUCLIDEAN from these two postulate Larson develop a COMPLETE theoretical Universe use various combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational- rotational motion the concept of IN ward and OUT ward SCALAR MOTIONS and speed in relation to the Speed of Light which Larson call UNIT VELOCITY and the NATURAL DATUM at each step in the development Larson be able to MATCH object in his theoretical Universe with object in the REAL physical universe photon sub atomic particle   INCOMPLETE ATOMS   charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar ETC even object not yet discover then such as EXPLODING galaxy and GAMMA RAY BURSTS and apply his theory to his new model of the atom Larson be able to precisely and accurately calculate inter- atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of this be describe in good detail with OUT fancy complex mathematic in his book BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson the following be a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe some of the early book be out of print now but still available through inter library loan the Structure of the Physical Universe 1959 the case against the Nuclear Atom 1963 beyond Newton 1964 New Light on Space and Time 1965 Quasars and Pulsars 1971 nothing but MOTION 1979   a   9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the   8.3 billion Super Collider    the last four chapter explain chemical bonding   the Neglected Facts of Science 1982 the UNIVERSE of MOTION 1984   FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery   BASIC property of matter 1988 all but the last of these book be publish by North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland or 97213 and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library does n't have each of they several of they include the last one be available from the International Society of Unified Science ISUS 1680 E. Atkin Ave Salt Lake City Utah 84106 this be the organization that be start to promote Larson 's theory they have other related publication include the quarterly journal RECIPROCITY Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson be a retired engineer Chemical or Electrical he be about 91 year old when he die in May 1989 he have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University he develop his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical property base only on the element use Larson 's lack of a fancy ph.d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore he but it be not a VALID reason sometimes it take a relative outsider to CLEARLY see the forest through the TREES at the same time it be clear from his book that he also know ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction AD HOC assumption principle of IMPOTENCE IN CONSISTENCIES ETC Larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it be not necessary for he to do so he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational datum and in many case his explanation FIT BETTER a self consistent theory be much MORE than the ORTHODOX physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for a unified field theory that work but have be ignore one for over 30 year now modern physics do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of Larson 's book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that epicycle crystal sphere geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seem to explain it well but be later prove CONCEPTUALLY wrong Prof. Frank H. Meyer Professor Emeritus of UW Superior be   be a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson 's theory and be or still be President of Larson 's organization the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY of UNIFIED SCIENCE and Editor of their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY he move to Minneapolis after retire Super Collider BOONDOGGLE I be against contruction of the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas or anywhere else it would be a gross WASTE of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value Most physicist do n't realize it but accord to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson as describe in his book the strange GOOFY particle meson hyperon ALLEGED quark etc which they be find in existing collider Fermi Lab Cern etc be really just ATOMS of ANTI MATTER which be create by the high energy colliding beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment a large and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti matter that the physicist have not see there before and the physicist will be even more confuse than they be now be a few more type of anti matter atom worth the   8.3 billion cost do n't we have much more important use for this waste money another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in Texas have a serious and grow problem with some kind of fire ant eat the insulation off underground cable how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the Supercollider name the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as propose be TOTALLY ABSURD if it be build it should be name after a lead particle physicist LARSONIAN Anti Matter in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe anti matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it have more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which Larson call Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum in Larson 's theory a positron be actually a particle of MATTER not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in Larson 's theory the ANTI matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of TIME and only one dimension of space and exist in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half LARSONIAN Relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury have be observe and precisely measure to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 second of arc per century 531 second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet Venus Earth Jupiter etc the remain 43 second of arc be be use to help prove Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity but the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieve result close to the 43 second than General Relativity can by instead use SPECIAL relativity in one or more of his book he apply the LORENTZ transformation on the high orbital speed of Mercury Larson TOTALLY reject General Relativity as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY he also reject most of Special Relativity include the part about mass increase near the speed of light and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shift great than 1.000 REALLY be move fast than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from we in TIME in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure be the CLOCK time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be NEGLIGIBLE- but at high speed they become significant and the Lorentz Transformation must be use as a FUDGE FACTOR   Larson often use the term coordinate TIME when write about this   in regard to mass increase it have be prove in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration   FORCE   MASS a   F   m Orthodox physicist be ignore the THIRD factor FORCE in Larson 's theory mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drop toward zero FORCE be actually a motion or combination of motion or relation between motion include INward and OUTward SCALAR motion the expansion of the universe for example be an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so call Big Bang which be yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY the UNIVERSE of MOTION I wish to recommend to everyone the book the UNIVERSE of MOTION by Dewey B. Larson 1984 North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland Oregon 97213 456 page index hardcover it contain the astrophysical portion of a GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by that author an UNrecognized geniu more than thirty year ago it contain FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the FORMATION of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true ORIGIN of the 3 degree background radiation cosmic ray and gamma- ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf explode galaxy etc it contain what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the following be an example of his Theory 's success in his first book in 1959 the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE Larson predict the existence of EXPLODING galaxy several year before astronomer start find they they be a NECESSARY consequence of Larson 's comprehensive theory and when QUASARS be discover he have an immediate relate explanation for they also GAMMA RAY BURSTS Astro physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious GAMMA RAY BURSTS they be originally think to originate from neutron star in the disc of our galaxy but the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit have be detect they in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any known object except for a few case of directional coincidence Gamma ray burst be a NECESSARY consequence of the GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson accord to page 386 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION publish in 1984 the gamma ray burst be come from SUPERNOVA explosion in the ANTI matter HALF of the physical universe which Larson call the Cosmic Sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with known object and come from all direction uniformly I wonder how close to we in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the MASS extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby GAMMA RAY BURSTS LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of they but binary star system be actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson I will try to summarize Larsons explanation which be detail in chapter 7 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION and in some of his other book first of all accord to Larson star do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the COMPLETE annihilation of heavy element heavy than IRON each element have a destructive TEMPERATURE LIMIT the heavy the element be the low be this limit a star 's internal temperature increase as it grow in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of light and light element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of IRON there be a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION this be because there be so much iron present- and that be relate to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which Larson explain in some of his book   well than I can   when the star explode the light material on the outer portion of the star be blow outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavy material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expand OUTWARD in TIME which be equivalent to inward in SPACE and it often actually disappear for a while over long period of time both masse start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blow outward in space now start to form a red GIANT star the material that have be blow OUTWARD in TIME start to form a WHITE DWARF star both star then start move back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the H R Diagram the chance of the two masse fall back into the exact same location in space make a single lone star again be near zero they will instead form a BINARY system orbit each other accord to Larson a white dwarf star have an inverse DENSITY gradient be dense at its SURFACE because the material at its center be most widely disperse blow outward in time this eliminate the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL fantasy about degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc LARSONIAN Solar System Formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affect by its heat etc these will become PLANETS in chapter 7 of the UNIVERSE of MOTION Larson use all this information and other principle of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode 's Law Black Hole FANTASY I hear that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black hole merge together into a single black hole and conclude that the new black hole would have MORE mass than the sum of the two original black hole such a result should be recognize by everyone as a RED FLAG cause widespread doubt about the whole IDEA of black hole etc after read Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe especially his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION it be clear to I that black hole be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL fantasy the strange object at Cygnus X-1 be just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to prove their theory by the way I do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist Stephen Hawking the physicist and astronomer seem to be act as if Hawking 's severe physical problem somehow make he wise it do not I wish the same attention have be give to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he be still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to Larson 's theory book and organization the International Society of Unified Science ELECTRO MAGNETIC PROPULSION I hear of that concept many year ago in connection with UFO 's and unorthodox inventor but I never be able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct I find a possible clue about why they might work on page 112 113 of the book BASIC property of MATTER by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson which describe part of Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe I quote one paragraph as indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrive at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it be bring out in volume I   Larson 's book nothing but MOTION   that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorb by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited it follow that there be always a large excess of free electron in the material sector   material half   of the universe most of which be uncharged in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remain permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate be thus expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there be other process to be discuss later whereby electron be return to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilize at an equilibrium level note that in Larson 's theory UNcharged electron be also massLESS and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spin around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity be the speed of light and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light accord to Larson 's theory   I might have the above and below label mix up   Larson be say that outer space be fill with mass- LESS UN charge electron fly around at the speed of light if this be true then the ELECTRO MAGNETIC propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhaps give they a charge and mass and shoot they toward the rear to achieve propulsion in Larson 's theory an electrical charge be a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimpose on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confused meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud suppression of LARSONIAN Physics the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson have be available for more than 30 year publish in 1959 in his first book the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE it be TOTALLY UN SCIENTIFIC for Hawking Wheeler Sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call science or physic or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education system to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson 's theory have they have Larson 's theory have excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer such as gamma ray burst and the nature of quasar Larson 's theory deserve to be HONESTLY and openly discuss in the physics chemistry and astronomy journal in the U.S. and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of Larson 's theory should be include in all related course at UW EC UW Madison Cambridge Cornell University and elsewhere so that student be not keep in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they be be feed for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited source especially Larson 's BOOKS UN altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this important partial summary be ENCOURAGED;2

981;Tony- I read your post it be nothing new I have see much the same in other typicalchristian anti gay sentimental literature gay people be and will con- tinue to be persecute as long as such propaganda petpetuate you may be unaware of all the statistica finding concern African Americans that have be publish and use by various group to re enforce their own bias against African Americans we usually think of the KKK in these instance but there be many other group of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such finding and document today but that be not always the case fortunately African Americans have white who support their 'cause and public sentiment be eventually if not entirely turn around there be even a Civil War and anti negro sentiment increase in fact until law be put in place to protect the inalienable right of Blacks it be pretty much legal to discriminate against they I know many gay and I will not turn my back on they or their right to be free form discrimination you may think that I have be deceive or something that be your perogative my church Christian Church Disciples of Christ openly affirm the right of oppressed people of all segment of society include gay we believe the Gospel message of preach to all creation and make disciple we believe in the lord 's great commandment to Love and we beleive in stand up for the oppressed even if it be not popular to do so I really like my church for last reason the most I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stand for the Gospel and believe in the commandment of Love though I 'm hard pressed to find many who actually sho love but not many be willing to champion the oppressed especially within their own community I may have lose face with the great christian community for the unpopularity of my belief but so do the abolitionist against the oppression of African Americans many be even kill and treat as runaway slave for be nigger lover and such I guess I 've decide the challenge be worth it in my talk with gay man and woman I have hear tragic story after tragic story center around fail marriage wife and husband who be straight who have be hurt in the process etc funny thing be I do n't know of one case where the parent ex wife or even child have continue to reject their gay family member son daughter ex husband father etc after they begin to take part in some form of support group like PFLAG I 'm apalle by the legislation which pass in Colorado and be equally out0 rage that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon from the Tradition Values Coalition have be actively work in the Christian underground to garner support within several 8 I believe state this come November for more oppressive legisation against gay perhaps you do n't get it and maybe you never will many did n't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God 's will be do as they massacre thousand in witch hunt and inquisition the message that come through loud and clear by proponent against gay right and against gay in general be that there be a strong dislike even hatred for gay whether you want to call it such or not it does n't change the result the major flaw in all this posturing be that in the end the final effect of post like that of yours and Mr. Hudson be that you have a conditional love for gay condition Change and we 'll love you this be sure strange come from a group who claim that God have an unconditional love one that call people just as they be sure there be thing that will naturally change and habit like alcoholism wife beating etc that need to be change through some sort of therapy but then there be thing like left handedness etc that no amount of beat it out of people be go to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people 's expectation in the process this coerce conformity cause many people a great deal of harm especially when it be cause by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puff up about their own sense of pseuper spirituality this be sad but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis have to do with something very personal like sexuality a taboo subject even today but I firmly believe in the right of individual to be free from impose regulation on thier bedroom It 's funny that most straight people have successfully remove restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression as though it help we maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay people be not criminal another interesting thing happen recently a very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley here have two of it 's pastor arrest for self- admit charge of pederasty man have sex with boy this have apparently be go on for some time a couple year but since the charge be voluntary and the church work closely with the police so I imagine that be how they manage to downplay it in the medium how could such a thing happen when the church itself have an ex gay ministry one of my friend recently tell I he be approach by someone who be go through the reparitive therapy there and he be thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner be not an invitation to attend the ministry these be difficult time we live in but provide hostile environment and create and perpetuate an atmosphere that breed hate and violence be not the call of the christian community the result of the pass amendment in Colorado have create an organization who 's poster be appear all over Colorado call S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T. I forget the whole definition off hand but the last part be against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash and their motto be work for a fag free America with an implicit advocation for violence this be sick and it seem to be what you and Mr. Hudson and other be embrace we Christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel do n't measure up and constant beratement from organization like the Christian Research Institute while they do have a good purpose also their major work seem to be find new and well way of exclude people the Gospel I believe be not so negative rather it seek way to include people I have several of Dr. Martin 's book and find they quite helpful especially concern cults but it seem that CRI have become a cult unto itself why do n't we just stick to the positive and find way to bring people to Jesus istead of take bullwhip and drive they away whatever;3

Wells take this position but that be because he take the very small minority view that Jesus never exist and he be a professor of German not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus;3

I have no quibble with that belief other than that it be useless and that objective be a perfectly good word    so what   be   objective not the age of the universe anyway as I show    above    how many age can the universe have and still be internally self-   consistent i 'd be amazed if it be more than one how many different   moral system can different member of society have indeed single   individual in some case and humanity still stick together beg the question People can have many opinion about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together you be say that the universe have a   real   age independent of my belief about it why   the age of the universe like most scientific fact can be   emirically verify through mean that 'll give the same result no matter   who perform the testing albeit there be error bar that may be on the   largish side this assume that the universe have a real age or any kind of reality which does n't depend on what we think why should an extreme Biblical Creationist give a rat 's ass about the mean of which you speak   i 've hear of no way to verify morality in a   consistent way much less compute the error of the measurement- care to   enlighten I the same be true of pain but painkiller exist and can be predict to work with some accuracy well than a random guess I write elsewhere that morality should be hypothesis about observe value if a moral system make a prediction it will be well if that can be test and be falsifiable in the same way as a prediction this drug will relieve pain   People 's   idea   about the age of object x be   not   objective-   you can have any idea you like and I ca n't stop you Universae and   their age be another ballgame- they be what they be and if you   dislike some detail of they that be a problem with your   opinion   of   they sure assume an objective reality and you get statement like this   I claim that morality be an opinion of ours and as such   subjective and individual if I 'm wrong then some more or less   objectively real thing exist which you label objective morality-   can you back up this positive claim of existence can you back up your positive claim above no That 's because it 's an assumption I make the same assumption about value on the basis that there be no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two be precisely the same     point moral be in essence personal opinion usually     ideally well found motivate such but nonetheless personal the     fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question     sometimes even for the same reason do not make moral objective- it     make human somewhat alike in their opinion on that moral question     which can be good for the evolution of a social specie      and if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there be a    football on a desk I 'm suppose to see a logical difference between the two    perhaps you can explain the difference to I since you seem to see it    so clearly    take a look on the desk i.e. perform a test If(football then   accept theory ELSE DO tell people they 're hallucinating    now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform I   which way to look and why to look that particular way as oppose to   some other get my drift no just look be you claim never to know what good mean      science   be a whole other matter altogether      say you prove that those who disagree be wrong    That be a simple matter of prove the track record of the   scientific method I think it 's great and should be apply to value I may be completely wrong but that be what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought;0

1687;in fact you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project the pricetag be invariably too high either in money or in hassle the important thing to realize here be that the big cost of get to the Moon be get into low Earth orbit everything else be practically down in the noise the only part of get to the Moon that pose any new problem beyond what you face in low orbit be the last 10 km the actual landing and that be not immensely difficult of course you   can   spend sagadollar saga- be the metric prefix for beelyun and beelyun on thing other than the launch but you do n't have to the major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply for more than a brief visit at least be low cost transport to Earth orbit for what it cost to launch one Shuttle or two Titan iv you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheap Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there be less ambitious way of bring cost down quite a bit any plan for do sustained lunar exploration use exist launch system be waste money in a big way give this question like whose launch facility you use be   not   a minor detail- they be very important to the cost of the launch which dominate the cost of the project;2

stand for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the committee that write the standard JPEG be design for compress either full color or gray scale digital image of natural real world scene it do not work so well on non realistic image such as cartoon or line drawing JPEG do not handle black and white 1 bit per pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name JBIG and mpeg respectively JPEG be lossy mean that the image you get out of decompression is n't quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieve much of its compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail are n't perceive as well as small detail of light and dark thus JPEG be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine analyze your image the small error introduce by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of JPEG be that the degree of lossiness can be vary by adjust compression parameter this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make   extremely   small file if you do n't mind poor quality- this be useful for indexing image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept less compression   2   why use JPEG there be two good reason to make your image file small and to store 24 bit per pixel color datum instead of 8 bit per pixel datum make image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archiving library of image be able to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 Kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare GIF and JPEG the size ratio be more like four to one More detail below if your view software does n't support JPEG directly you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for view or manipulating image even with a jpeg capable viewer it take long to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simple format GIF for instance thus use JPEG be essentially a time   space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply It 's worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a short file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format be that JPEG can store full color information 24 bit   pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or few color if you have only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though 8 bit GIF will look as obsolete as black and white MacPaint format do today furthermore for reason detail in section 7 JPEG be far more useful than GIF for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware hence JPEG be considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet post standard   3   when should I use jpeg and when should I stick with GIF JPEG be   not   go to displace GIF entirely- for some type of image GIF be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about JPEG be which kind of image to apply it to as a rule of thumb JPEG be superior to GIF for store full color or gray scale image of realistic scenes- that mean scan photograph and similar material JPEG be superior even if you do n't have 24 bit display hardware and it be a LOT superior if you do see section 7 for detail GIF do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such as cartoon and line drawing in particular large area of pixel that be all   exactly   the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by GIF JPEG ca n't squeeze these file as much as GIF do without introduce visible defect this sort of image be well keep in GIF form in particular single color border be quite cheap in GIF file but they should be avoid in JPEG file JPEG also have a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure black pixel adjacent to a row of pure white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing be not find in scanned photograph but it show up fairly often in GIF file border overlaid text etc the blurriness be particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixel high if you have a GIF with a lot of small size overlaid text do n't jpeg it computer draw image ray trace scene for instance usually fall between scanned image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it the same go for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such plain black and white two level image should never be convert to JPEG you need at least about 16 gray level before JPEG be useful for gray scale image it should also be note that GIF be lossless for gray scale image of up to 256 level while JPEG be not if you have an exist library of GIF image you may wonder whether you should convert they to JPEG you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argue that jpeg image quality be superior to GIF only apply if both format start from a full color original if you start from a GIF you 've already irretrievably lose a great deal of information- jpeg can only make thing bad however the disk space saving may justify convert anyway this be a decision you 'll have to make for yourself if you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hint be prepared to leave some image in GIF format since some gif will not convert well   4   how well do JPEG compress image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image I have handy a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purposes- the rest be create with the free jpeg software describe in section 6B. filet Size in bytesttcomment ship.ppmt1145040 original file in PPM format no compression- 24 bit ttt or 3 byte per pixel plus a few byte overhead ship.ppm Zt 963829 PPM file pass through Unix compress ttt compress does n't accomplish a lot you 'll note ttt other text orient compressor give similar result ship.gift 240438 convert to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256   ppmtogif ttt Most of the saving be the result of lose color ttt info GIF save 8 bit   pixel not 24 see sec 7 ship.jpg95 t 155622 cjpeg -q 95 high useful quality set ttt this be indistinguishable from the 24 bit original ttt at least to my nonprofessional eyeball ship.jpg75 t 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 default setting ttt you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this ttt from the original even with both on screen at once ship.jpg50 t 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 ttt this have slight defects- if you know what to look ttt for you could tell it 's be JPEGed without see ttt the original still as good image quality as many ttt recent posting in Usenet picture group ship.jpg25 t 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 ttt jpeg 's characteristic blockiness become apparent ttt at this setting djpeg -blocksmooth help some ttt still I 've see plenty of Usenet posting that be ttt of poor image quality than this ship.jpg5ot 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize -optimize cut table overhead ttt Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or ttt indexing purpose note that this file be TINY ttt the compression ratio from the original be 173:1 in this case jpeg can make a file that be a factor of four or five small than a GIF of comparable quality the -q 75 file be every bit as good as the GIF well if you have a full color display this seem to be a typical ratio for real world scene   5   what be good quality setting for jpeg Most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by select a quality setting there seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting Quality 95 do not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claim the quality scale be purely arbitrary- it be not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use JPEG be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompress into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality setting -Q 75 be very often the good choice this setting be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try -q 75 first- if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above -Q 95- say -Q 100 will produce a file two or three time as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any well quality if the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a high quality set to avoid further degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gif to JPEG the default -Q 75 be about right for compress 24 bit image but -Q 85 to 95 be usually well for convert gif see section 14 for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 be about right -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art note the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free jpeg software describe in section 6b and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program do n't even provide a numeric scale just high   medium   low style choice   6   where can I get JPEG software Most of the program describe in this section be available by FTP if you do n't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article how to find source if you do n't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in news.answer or you can get it by send e mail to mail-serverrtfm.mit.edu with send usenet   news.answer   finding source in the body the Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful it 's usenet   news.answer   ftp list   faq in the news.answer archive note this list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late JPEG FAQ from the news.answer archive   6a   if you be look for can software viewer etc the first part of this list be system specific program that only run on one kind of system if you do n't see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software describe at the end of the list note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over Internet- but some commercial program be list too X Windows John Bradley 's free XV version 2.00 and up be an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and other image format It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu the file be call xv-???.tar Z where be the version number currently 2.21)- it be locate in the contrib directory on export or the pub   xv directory at upenn XV reduce all image to 8 bit internally which mean it be not a real good choice if you have a 24 bit display you 'll still get only 8 bit color also you should n't use XV to convert full color image to jpeg because they 'll get color quantize first but XV be a fine tool for convert GIF and other 8 bit image to jpeg caution there be a glitch in version 2.21 and early be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x Windows be John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   ImageMagick.tar Z. this package handle many image processing and conversion task the ImageMagick viewer handle 24 bit display correctly- for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support JPEG in its late release 3.03 xloadimage be free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xloadimage.3.03.tar Z. xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by its fan to be somewhat fast and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed fast and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it have the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 be use a hack over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xli.1.14.tar Z. both program be say to do the right thing with 24 bit display MS DOS this cover plain dos- for Windows or os2 program see the next heading one good choice be Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG which view JPEG and GIF file the current version 2.4a be available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca 129.97.50.50 file pub   jpeg   viewer   dvpeg24a.zip this be a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386486 machine the user interface be not flashy but it 's functional another freeware JPEG   GIF   TGA viewer be Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview the current version 1.2 be available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   hv12.zip Hiview require a 386 or well cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager QEMM386 and 386max work- Windows and os2 do not Hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen for large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning   scroll as most viewer do you may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no deny that it slow down loading of large image considerably note installation be a bit tricky- read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be ColorView for DOS   30 this be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative its user interface be also much spiffier look although personally I find it hard to use more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be fast than DVPEG but a little slow than Hiview at least on my hardware for image large than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both be fast than Hiview the current version be 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   dcview21.zip require a vesa graphic driver- if you do n't have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory many recent pc have a build in vesa driver so do n't try to load a vesa driver unless ColorView complain that the driver be miss a second shareware alternative be Fullview which have be kick around the net for a while but I do n't know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway the author tell I that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the Simtel20 archive at that time the well know GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW support JPEG in its late revision 8.60a however CSHOW 's jpeg implementation is n't very good it 's slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi color display too bad it 'd have be nice to see a good jpeg capability in CSHOW Shareware   25 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   gif   cshw860a.zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic hardware any one of these viewer might not work on your particular machine if you ca n't get   any   of they to work you 'll need to use one of the following conversion program to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer if you have hi color hardware do n't use GIF as the intermediate format- try to find a targa capable viewer instead VPIC5.0 be repute to do the right thing with hi color display the Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converter be ftpable from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   jpeg4.zip or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory these file be DOS compilation of the free source code describe in section 6b- they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM format Handmade Software offer free JPEGGIF conversion tool GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF these be slow and be limit to conversion to and from GIF format- in particular you ca n't get 24 bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tool be that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary jpeg format as well as the Usenet standard JFIF format since HSI format file be rather widespread on BBSes this be a useful capability Version 2.0 of

document refer to directory eg msdo   graphic at Simtel20 that really mean pd1 msdos.graphics   if you be not physically on MILnet you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rate from Simtel20 there be several internet site that maintain copy mirror of the Simtel20 archives- most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead a popular USA mirror site be oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117 which keep Simtel20 file in eg pub   msdo   graphic if you have no FTP capability you can retrieve file from Simtel20 by e mail- see informational posting in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how if you be outside the USA consult the same newsgroup to learn where your near Simtel20 mirror be Microsoft Windows there be several Windows program capable of display JPEG image Windows viewer be generally slow than DOS viewer on the same hardware due to Windows system overhead note that you can run the DOS conversion program describe above inside a Windows DOS window the new entry be WinECJ which be free and EXTREMELY fast Version 1.0 be available from ftp.rahul.net file pub   bryanw   pc   jpeg   wecj.zip require Windows 3.1 and 256 or more color mode this be a no frill viewer with the bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decodes- and the image quality be noticeably bad than other viewer but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway at least for previewing JView be freeware fairly fast have good on line help and can write out the decompress image in Windows BMP format- but it ca n't create new jpeg file and it does n't view gif JView also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer such as brightness adjustment but it be an excellent basic viewer the current version 0.9 be available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.84 file pub   pc   win3   desktop

Shareware   20 Macintosh Most Mac jpeg program rely on Apple 's jpeg implementation which be part of the QuickTime system extension- so you need to have quicktime instal to use QuickTime you need a 68020 or well cpu and you need to be run System 6.0.7 or later if you 're run System 6 you must also install the 32 bit QuickDraw extension- this be build in on System 7 you can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   quicktime.hqx as of 1192 this file contain QuickTime 1.5 which be well than QT 1.0 in several way with respect to jpeg it be marginally fast and considerably less prone to crash when feed a corrupt jpeg file however some application seem to have compatibility problem with QT 1.5 Mac user should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format PICT   JPEG be not the same as the Usenet standard JFIF JPEG format see section 10 for detail if you post image on Usenet make sure they be in JFIF format Most of the program mention below can generate either format the first choice be probably jpegview a free program for view image that be in JFIF format PICT   JPEG format or GIF format it also can convert between the two JPEG format the current version 2.0 be a big improvement over prior version get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 file info mac   app   jpeg view-20.hqx require System 7 and QuickTime on 8 bit display jpegview usually produce the good color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewer jpegview can view large image in much less memory than other Mac viewers- in fact it 's the only one that can deal with jpeg image much over 640x480 pixel on a typical 4 MB Mac give a large image jpegview automatically scale it down to fit on the screen rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer you can zoom in on any desire portion though some people like this behavior some do n't Overall JPEGView 's user interface be very well think out GIFConverter a shareware   40 image viewer   converter support JFIF and PICT   JPEG as well as GIF and several other image format the late version be 2.3.2 get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   art   gif   gif converter-232.hqx Requires System 6.0.5 or later GIFConverter be not well than JPEGView as a plain jpeg   GIF viewer but it have much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image also the new version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF image   without   QuickTime so it be your good bet if your machine be too old to run QuickTime but it 's fast with QuickTime note if GIFConverter run out of memory try to load a large jpeg try convert the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then view the GIF version JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utility be available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   jpeg convert-10.hqx this will run on any Mac but it only do file conversion not view you can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer previous version of this FAQ recommend Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEGGIF converter base on an old version of the IJG code if you be use this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert Apple 's free program PictPixie can view image in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these format you can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   qt.1.0.stuff   pictpixie.hqx require QuickTime PictPixie be intend as a developer 's tool and it 's really not the good choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime some of its drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface bad PictPixie be an unsupported program mean it have some minor bug that Apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of PictPixie call PICTCompressor float around the net if you have this you should trash it as it 's even buggy also the QuickTime Starter Kit include a much clean up descendant of PictPixie call Picture Compressor note that Picture Compressor be not free and may not be distribute on the net storm technology 's Picture Decompress be a free JPEG viewer   converter this rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be force to use it on old system it do need 32 bit QuickDraw so really old machine ca n't use it you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   picture decompress-201.hqx you must set the file type of a download image file to jpeg to allow Picture Decompress to open it if your machine be too old to run 32 bit QuickDraw a Mac plus for instance GIFConverter be your only choice for single program JPEG view if you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer More and more commercial Mac application be support jpeg although not all can deal with the Usenet standard JFIF format Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF format jpeg file use the JPEG plug in from the Acquire menu you must set the file type of a download jpeg

capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24 bit image file there be numerous commercial jpeg offering with more pop up every day I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assist product ask pointed question about whether the product comply with the final jpeg

quantization Most people do n't have full color 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 or few bit per pixel so it can display 256 or few distinct color at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color this process be call color quantization this be something of a misnomer color selection would be a well term we 're stick with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy process it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by JPEG except at the very low jpeg quality setting since JPEG be a full color format convert a color jpeg image for display on 8 bit or less hardware require color quantization this be true for   all   color jpeg even if you feed a 256 or less color GIF into JPEG what come out of the decompressor be   not   256 color but thousand of color this happen because JPEG 's lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get smear into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be always require to display a color jpeg on a colormappe display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a JPEG image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference I occasionally see post image describe as 256 color jpeg this tell I that the poster a has n't read this FAQ and b probably convert the jpeg from a GIF jpeg can be classify as color or gray scale just like photograph but number of color just is n't a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a GIF image by definition have already be quantize to 256 or few color a GIF   do   have a definite number of color in its palette and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entry for purpose of Usenet picture distribution GIF have the advantage that the sender precompute the color quantization so recipient do n't have to this be also the   disadvantage   of GIF you 're stick with the sender 's quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re quantize result in much poor image quality than if you have quantize once from a full color image furthermore if the sender did n't use a high quality color quantization algorithm you 're out of luck for this reason JPEG offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine do n't match the sender 's display hardware JPEG 's full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user 's display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of jpeg image you already have with a GIF you 're stick forevermore with what be send It 's also worth mention that many GIF view program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a 256 color GIF on a 16 color EGA display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to this be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the GIF one to display it but often it be also due to sloppiness JPEG conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizer in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be display thus JPEG be likely to provide well result than the average GIF program for low color resolution display as well as high resolution one finally an ever grow number of people have well than-8 bit display hardware already 15 bit hi color pc display true 24 bit display on workstation and macintosh etc for these people GIF be already obsolete as it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thus JPEG be an all around well choice than GIF for represent image in a machine independent fashion   8   how do jpeg work the buzz word to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transform coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article 's long enough already so i 'm not go to say more than that here for technical information see the comp.compression FAQ this be available from the news.answer archive at rtfm.mit.edu in file pub   usenet   news.answer   compression faq   part1 3   if you need help in use the news.answer archive see the top of this article   9   what about lossless jpeg There be a great deal of confusion on this subject the JPEG committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantee the final output be bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offer much less compression at present very few implementation of lossless JPEG exist and all of they be commercial say -q 100 to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossless image what it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsample step with the v4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsample keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular JPEG algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value- it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit for bit accuracy if you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than 6 bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard this perform well than jpeg lossless on such image JPEG lossless be superior to JBIG on image with 6 or more bit per pixel- furthermore JPEG be public domain at least with a Huffman back end while the JBIG technique be heavily cover by patent   10   why all the argument about file format strictly speak JPEG refer only to a family of compression algorithms- it do   not   refer to a specific image file format the JPEG committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we ca n't actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leave we with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to do their own thing and as a result their program are n't compatible with anybody else 's the close thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format be some work that be be coordinate by people at C Cube Microsystems they have define two jpeg base file format   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a low end format that transport pixel and not much else   tiff   JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format TIFF be a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides TIFF be a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of TIFF It 's not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these format be develop with input from all the major vendor of jpeg relate products- it 's reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture posting JFIF be simple than TIFF and be available now- the TIFF 6.0 spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when TIFF   JPEG be well define the JFIF format be likely to be a widely support low common denominator- tiff   jpeg file may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in be Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh QuickTime use a JFIF compatible format wrap inside the Mac specific pict structure conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG be pretty straightforward and several Mac program be available to do it see Mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a QuickTime jpeg PICT down to JFIF by hand- see section 11 for detail another particular case be Handmade Software 's program GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy these program be capable of read and write JFIF format by default though they write a proprietary format develop by HSI this format be not readable by any non hsi program and should not be use for Usenet posting use the -j switch to get JFIF output this apply to old version of these programs- the current release emit JFIF format by default you still should be careful not to post HSI format file unless you want to get flame by people on non pc platform   11   how do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wo n't read it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary jpeg base format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file 1 a JFIF standard file will start with the character hex FF d8 FF E0 follow by two variable byte often hex 00 10 follow by jfif 2 if you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this be probably decodable as be by JFIF software it 's worth a try anyway 3 HSI file start with hsi1 You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg datum but they wo n't decompress properly with non hsi program 4 a Macintosh pict file if jpeg compress will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a JFIF header scan for JFIF strip off everything before the FF d8 and you should be able to read it 5 anything else it 's a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG datum stream if you can identify the start of the JPEG datum stream look for FF D8 try strip off everything before that in uuencoded Usenet posting the characteristic JFIF pattern be tbegin line tmcx whereas uuencoded HSI file will start with tbegin line tm:'-i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non jfif file   12   what about arithmetic coding the JPEG spec define two different back end module for the final output of compress datum either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding be allow the choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produce a small compressed file on typical image arithmetic coding produce a file 5 or 10 percent small than Huffman code all the file size number previously cite be for Huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specify by the JPEG standard be subject to patent own by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi thus   you can not legally use arithmetic coding   unless you obtain license from these company the fair use doctrine allow people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at well at least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding- the space saving is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic coding   should not   be use for any image to be exchange on Usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for further detail   13   do loss accumulate with repeat compression   decompression it would be nice if having compress an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately this be not the case in general recompresse an altered image lose more information though usually not as much as be lose the first time around the next good thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it   without change it   then there be no further loss i.e. you get an identical jpeg file even this be not true- at least not with the current free JPEG software It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on our to do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limit but I be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guarantee would be that compress the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple change as crop off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you 're wonder why it 's because the pixel block boundary move if you crop off only multiple of 16 pixel you might be safe but that be a mighty limited capability the bottom line be that JPEG be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossless format PPM RLE TIFF etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression   decompression time this way   14   what be some rule of thumb for convert GIF image to jpeg as state early you   will   lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist GIF image to JPEG if you can obtain the original full color datum the GIF be make from it 's far well to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality the first rule when convert a GIF library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif- that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary some gif may be well leave as GIFs as explain in section 3- in particular cartoon type GIFs with sixteen or few color do n't convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be   large   than the GIF so check the size too experience to date suggest that large high visual quality gif be the good candidate for conversion to JPEG they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to JPEG with least degradation do n't waste your time convert any GIF much under 100 Kbytes also do n't expect jpeg file convert from GIFs to be as small as those create directly from full color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg file would be i.e. shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the GIF file not 14th as suggest in early comparison many people have develop an odd habit of put a large constant color border around a GIF image while useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in GIF file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact ghost edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpege if you be on an x Windows system XV 's manual and automatic cropping function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default q setting of 75 be appropriate for full color input but for GIF input q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggest below the high Q setting may not be necessary Color gif of photograph or complex artwork be usually dither to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that GIF can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different colors- at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to JPEG it look like high spatial frequency color noise- and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have get from jpege the original full color image if you have it to get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression smooth average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you think you see anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color change that give JPEG trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid use a high q factor thus far reduce the size of the compressed file while still obtain a well look output image than you 'd get without smooth with the v4 free JPEG software or product base on it a simple smoothing capability be build in try -smooth 10 or so when convert gif value of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gif heavy handed dithering may require large smoothing factor if you can see regular fine scale pattern on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing be definitely call for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you do n't want if you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package however cjpeg 's build in smoother be a LOT fast than pnmconvol the upshot of all this be that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 be probably a good starting point for convert GIFs but if you really care about the image you 'll want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting for more information about JPEG in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-infouunet.uu.net;1
1174;wrong about what I think they be correct in think that a well place bomb or six would get headline but I think they be wrong if they think that you can set off bomb and still be a Buddhist maybe what we be see here be that chinese cultural genocide against the Tibetans have work well enough that some Tibetans be now no long buddhist and be instead willing to behave like the chinese occupier every action be its own reward on the other hand people who be aware of the occupation be mostly full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up with it and what do it cost we to admire they Zip yes they be and whether this serve they well or not depend on whether they want buddhist principle or political independence and without political independence can they preserve their cultural and religious tradition the Chinese would certainly refer to they as terrorist just as the Hitler regime use to refer to european resistance movement as terrorist well off in what way as proponent of pacifism or as proponent of political autonomy and well off in what time scale the Soviet Empire practise cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minority some of which resist violently and some of which do not but in the end it be the Soviet Empire that collapse and at least some of the minority survive now some of the minority be fight one another be that because they have to or because violent resistance to an oppressive Empire legitimize violence;3

11;I be happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an INTERACTIVE full color image viewer and editor base on SGI GL besides typical touchup task such as crop rotate smooth etc bit offer some unique feature not available in similar program such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image the following be the relevant section from the man page Pre Release of May 1993 BIT(1L name bit bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations description bit be an interactive full color image viewer and editor base on Silicon Graphics GL as a full color program bit handle image of both 24bit and color index in a natural and efficient manner as an image viewer bit allow list of image to be display in their original type 24bit or color index in any order and in any of the many build in style of display you can walk up and down the list use mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the SlideShow with the pan and zoom feature large image can be view in full without be limit by the window or screen size as an image editor bit perform a large number of image editing and processing task accurately and efficiently it keep information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by perform subpixel sampling automatically while conserve the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion andor quantization of input image you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figure can be render on top of an image for annotation with the option to make they part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the high printer resolution e.g. PostScript Bit can also be use as a graphical user interface to many exist image processing program by define external binding which in essence turn command line orient program into bit subfunction and can be access by a press of a button and good of all the process image will be read back and display immediately convolution use exter- nally define matrix of arbitrary order can be perform dynamically give great flexibility in process an image features Bit perform all of its image manipulation interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing be complete the process image will be display current feature include o rotate an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and fill the rotate out region with an arbitrary color o scale an image by arbitrary factor in x- andor y direction with the option of subpixel sampling o render text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of render directly into the raster or save the text and raster separately such as into a PostScript file to take advantage of a high printer resolution besides normal text string many predefine special symbol can be input conveniently as in TeX(1 e.g.   lphasmalleta produce Greek alphabet alpha follow by a slightly small greek alphabet beta o present graphically the histogram of an image o perform arbitrary 1 to-1 pixel transformation the transformation function can be specify interactively and can be of arbitrary form far the transformation can be apply to RGB channel separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult task such as thresholding can be accomplish rather easily by 1 to-1 transformation in combination with the avai- lability of graphical histogram of the image o place simple geometric figure SGFs e.g. arrow circle trian- gle etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary location address either in absolute pixel or in some user definable coordinate system unit with the option of render directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately e.g PostScript file all SGFs can be scale in x- and y direction independently or simultaneously this be how to get an ellipse from a circle o perform edge detection in combination with image histogram and 1- to-1 transformation very accurate result can be obtain o perform histogram equalization o perform convolution with externally define square matrix of arbitrary order o crop a rectangular portion of an image o cut and paste across image o magnifie any portion of an image by any amount o display a list of image in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between image SlideShow o measure RGB intensity of a pixel at any location or all pixel along an arbitrary line with the result present as RGB intensity or as an intensity vs. distance plot o perform image type conversion o convert image format o Smoothes an image special convolution o filter an image by external program and read the filter image back and display it o modify an individual pixel 's RGB value o perform FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the result power spectra o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release support FORMATS o IRIS RGB native to SGI IRIS o JPEG(JFIF format o CompuServ GIF o pnm(portable any Map include PPM PGM and PBM o XBM X Window Bitmap o TIFF o PostScript(Write only Hardware requirement any
