274;' I produce an error last week about CHORION : I abhor publish trash ( I abhor it of myself even more than I do from other , but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject , I do not feel dishonest , though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example ) . thus I feel honor bind to do a well set of research specifically on the word . first it should be note that greek grammar be not as tough as I first assume ( it be not nontrivial by any mean , and I still be not competent with it , but it be not as opaque as I have think ) . it turn out that while the Index for the Bauer - Arndt - Gingrich Greek Lexicon render each verse in order , each word within a verse be put in greek alphabetical order . thus while the the meaning of the verse be decipherable , the syntax be far from clear . on the other hand , a Greek - English Intralinear Bible make thing a lot more comprehendable . and yes , the word for field in act 1:18 be indeed chorion . now I've check several greek - english lexicon : tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament , Louw and Nida tRobinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament , Grimm tWord study Concordance , Tynsdale tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other t early Christian Writings , Bauer - Arndt - Gingrich tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon , Perschbacher in each case the meaning of the word Chorion be give variously as : ta space , place , region , district , field , area , country place , tland , farm , estate , a bit of tillage , and similar meaning . nowhere do any of these book mention anything about grave . as some of these book go into great detail , I would be very surprised to find that these book be all inadequate and Mr Archer be the only competent scholar in Greek . I think it more likely that Mr Archer 's investigation into contradiction to be once again , as your friend say it , lack in substance , and thus Archer be again show worthless as an expert witness ( by the way Mr DeCenso , I would have honorably present my result on this matter , even if I have find they to support Mr Archer 's contention ) . by the way , among these lexicon , ( eg : Robinson 's ) be the definition of agros , the word use in Matthew 27 to describe the field buy . the word agros be define as a field in the country . Chorion be specifically note as a synonym to agros . this be significant , as it be evidence of how silly Bullinger 's exegisis be , which state that the word for field in Matthew ( ie : agros ) be different from the word for field in act ( ie : chorion ) , and thus we must be talk about two different field ( of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger 's exegisis be , but this be a small serendipity which drive the point home ) . so as of now , unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reason to believe otherwise ( eg : a reputable scholar with reputable reference ) , I consider this particular issue close . see Mr DeCenso , now you can go on to answer question about the denial of Peter , the day of the Crucifixion , Tyre , and the fact that the author of Matthew quote from the wrong prophet in discuss the potter 's Field . ttttLater , ttttdave Butler ';3

I decide something a little long would give close to real - world result ( for well or for bad ) . I pull out a copy of 2001 : a Space Odyssey that I have record off tv a while back . about fifteen minute into the movie , there 's a sequence where the Earth shuttle be approach the space station . specifically , I digitize a portion of about 30 seconds ' duration , zoom in on the rotate space station . I figure this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frame . to increase the difference between frame , I digitize it at only 5 frame per second , to give a total of 171 frame . I capture the raw footage at a resolution of 384  288 pixel with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 ( quarter - size resolution from a pal source ) . I then import it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor , keep the 5 fps frame rate . I create two version of the movie : one scale to 320  240 resolution , the other at 160  120 resolution . I use the default 2.00 quality set in Premiere 2.0.1 , and specify a key frame every ten frame . I then run the 320  240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I use for the result I'd be report early . result : a playback rate of over 45 frame per second . That 's right , I be get a much high result than with that first short test movie . just for fun , I copy the 320  240 movie to my external hard disk ( a Quantum lp105s ) , and run it from there . this time the playback rate be only about 35 frame per second . obviously the 230 mb internal hard disk ( also a Quantum ) be a significant contributor to the speed of playback . I modify my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factor , and try play back the 160  120 movie scale to 320  240 size . this time the playback speed be over 60 fps . clearly , the poster who observe poor performance on scale playback be see QuickTime 1.0 in action , not 1.5 . i'd try my test with QuickTime 1.0 , but I don't think it 's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1 ... unscale , the playback rate for the 160  120 movie be over 100 fps . the other thing I try be save version of the 320  240 movie with preferred playback rate great than 1.0 , and see how well they play from within MoviePlayer ( ie with QuickTime 's normal synchronize playback ) . a preferred rate of 9.0 (  45 fps ) didn't work too well : the playback be very jerky . compare this with the raw speed test , which achieve 45 fps with ease . I can't believe that QuickTime 's synchronization code would add this much overhead : I think the slowdown be come from the Mac system 's task switching . a preferred rate of 7.0 (  35 fps ) seem to work fine : I couldn't see any evidence of stutter . at 8.0 (  40 fps ) I  think  I could see slight stutter , but with four key frame every second , it be hard to tell . I guess I could try recreate the movie with a long interval between the key frame , to make the stutter more noticeable . of course , this will also improve the compression slightly , which should speed up the playback performance even more ...

( 2 ) type of scaling ( QT be optimize for double size scaling , other scale factor hit peformance much hard ) . ( 3 ) playback window position ( MoviePlayer limit your window placement choice to advantagous pixel boundary by default , I'm not sure about Premiere ) . any combination of those can radically alter playback performance . image size be , of course , another biggie . give the movie player lot of ram can also make a real difference . forgive I if these be mention early in the thread ... -peter Lee ';1

I call the Mitsubishi people and ask about the 256 level claim and they say that be only available when use with the video signal input . this be not mention in the sale literature . however they do say the P78U can do 6 bit  pixel ( 64 level ) image in parallel mode , but they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so , and they would call Japan , etc . frankly , I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit  pixel image from the video source , it can't store 8 bit  pixel in the memory .

I respect he as someone who have make his valuable contribution to the church , but I personally do not rely on his personal interpretation ( his book Mormon Doctrine be oftentime refer to as McConkie 's Bible in mormon circle ) on mormon doctrine .

I find it hard to swell with pride that the good new space - lifter idea be to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missile . well - the pessimist be wrong . the legacy be continue . this event be proof . to our technological parent : We've listen to your story . we've catch your enthusiasm and can - do spirit . and we've learn from your achievement - and your mistake . let I honor one of you who be part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter . you be one of the great engineer of the firt great age of space exploration . your insight and discipline build the Thor icbm - later incorporate into today 's most successful launch vehicle - the Delta . you tell we in the 60 's that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be build . you advocate this idea tirelessly . it be elegantly simple , as be all great breakthrough . you show we how to build it . you convince we it could be do . you be work by our side to weld its component into place . most important - you remind we of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learn from the generation before you - the generation that build transcontinental aviation in the 1920 's and 30 's - build a little and test a little and Max , you pass all of this on to people like Pat Ladner who start this program for the SDI . Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a dc-10 . they didn't even start with a dc-3 . our grandfather build a little , test a little - even sell a little and make a little money - before they move on to the next step . they didn't take a decade or more before put the first rubber on the road . Max Hunter - you didn't take ten year to build Thor , and by God we're not go to take ten year to show that low cost , single stage , reusable aerospace transportation be real . we end the cold war in a few short year . it take the same team here today but a few year to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end . we - you and we - launch a series of satellite - the Delta experiment - in about a year apiece . this , more than anything else signal our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union . those who make the decision on both side have underscore the importance of our work in bring about a new international relationship . but it be the same team which be now put in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that be our legacy for the next generation . we will make space access routine and affordable . we build this magnificent flying machine in two year . this summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time . then we can and surely will build in the next three year a reusable sub - orbital rocket . it will allow we to use space rapidly , affordably , and efficiently as no other nation can . and yes - we'll make a little money off it too ! then - and only then - we'll spend another three year to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system . the dc-3 of space will be a reality ! we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthrough of our former cold war adversary . what a wonderful irony if this SDI product and russian effort to counter SDI merge to power mankind 's next step to the star ! to be sure , we must guard against the temptation to leap to the final answer . Robert Goddard 's first rocket weren't Saturn V 's ! if we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollar and a few more year to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail . Max Hunter and his colleague show the way . three year and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhaust . there be no short - cut . if we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time . mind on task at hand !

981;' Tony- I read your post , it be nothing new , I have see much the same in other typicalchristian anti - gay sentimental literature . gay people be and will con- tinue to be persecute as long as such propaganda petpetuate . you may be unaware of all the statistica finding concern African - Americans that have be publish and use by various group to re - enforce their own bias against African - Americans . we usually think of the KKK in these instance , but there be many other group . of course , the vast majority of the public scoff at such finding and document today , but that be not always the case . fortunately African - Americans have white who support their 'cause ' and public sentiment be eventually ( if not entirely ) turn around . there be even a Civil War , and anti - negro sentiment increase . in fact , until law be put in place to protect the inalienable right of Blacks it be pretty much legal to discriminate against they . I know many gay and I will not turn my back on they or their right to be free form discrimination . you may think that I have be deceive or something , that be your perogative . my church , Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) openly affirm the right of oppressed people of all segment of society , include gay . we believe the Gospel message of preach to all creation and make disciple . we believe in the lord 's great commandment to Love , and we beleive in stand up for the oppressed , even if it be not popular to do so . I really like my church for last reason the most . I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stand for the Gospel and believe in the commandment of Love ( though I'm hard - pressed to find many who actually sho love ) , but not many be willing to champion the oppressed , especially within their own community . I may have lose face with the great christian community for the unpopularity of my belief , but so do the abolitionist against the oppression of African - Americans . many be even kill and treat as runaway slave for be nigger - lover and such . I guess I've decide the challenge be worth it . in my talk with gay man and woman I have hear tragic story after tragic story center around fail marriage , wife and husband who be straight who have be hurt in the process , etc . funny thing be , I don't know of one case where the parent , ex - wife , or even child have continue to reject their gay family member ( son , daughter , ex - husband , father , etc . ) after they begin to take part in some form of support group , like PFLAG . I'm apalle by the legislation which pass in Colorado , and be equally out0 rage that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon ( from the Tradition Values Coalition ) have be actively work in the Christian underground to garner support within several ( 8 I believe ) state this come November for more oppressive legisation against gay . perhaps you don't get it , and maybe you never will . many didn't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God 's will be do as they massacre thousand in witch hunt and inquisition . the message that come through , loud and clear , by proponent against gay right and against gay in general , be that there be a strong dislike , even hatred for gay , whether you want to call it such or not ( it doesn't change the result ) . the major flaw in all this posturing be that in the end , the final effect of post like that of yours and Mr. Hudson be that you have a conditional love for gay . condition : Change and we'll love you . this be sure strange come from a group who claim that God have an unconditional love , one that call people just as they be . sure there be thing that will 'naturally ' change , and habit ( like alcoholism , wife beating , etc . ) that need to be change through some sort of therapy . but then there be thing like left - handedness , etc . that no amount of beat it out of people , be go to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people 's expectation . in the process this coerce conformity cause many people a great deal of harm , especially when it be cause by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puff up about their own sense of pseuper - spirituality . this be sad , but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change . it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis have to do with something very personal like 'sexuality ' ( a taboo subject even today ) , but I firmly believe in the right of individual to be free from impose regulation on thier bedroom . It 's funny that most straight people have successfully remove restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation , but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression ... as though it help we maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society . gay people be not criminal . another interesting thing happen recently . a very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley ( here ) have two of it 's pastor arrest for self- admit charge of pederasty ( man have sex with boy ) . this have apparently be go on for some time ( a couple year ? ) , but since the charge be voluntary , and the church work closely with the police , so I imagine that be how they manage to downplay it in the medium . how could such a thing happen when the church , itself , have an ex - gay ministry ? one of my friend recently tell I he be approach by someone who be go through the reparitive therapy there , and he be thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner be not an invitation to attend the ministry . these be difficult time we live in , but provide hostile environment and create and perpetuate an atmosphere that breed hate and violence be not the call of the christian community . the result of the pass amendment in Colorado have create an organization who 's poster be appear all over Colorado call S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T. ( I forget the whole definition off hand , but the last part be against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash ) and their motto be work for a fag - free America with an implicit advocation for violence . this be sick , and it seem to be what you and Mr. Hudson , and other be embrace . we Christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel don't 'measure up ' , and constant beratement from organization like the Christian Research Institute , while they do have a good purpose also , their major work seem to be find new and well way of exclude people . the Gospel I believe be not so negative , rather it seek way to include people . I have several of Dr. Martin 's book and find they quite helpful , especially concern 'cults. ' but it seem that CRI , have become a cult unto itself . why don't we just stick to the positive and find way to bring people to Jesus istead of take bullwhip and drive they away ? whatever ';3

128;' well , I'll avoid your question for now ( get some learnin ' to do ) with a promise to come back with more info when I can find it . I  do  know that BATSE be the primary instrument in the development of the all - sky map of long - term source . give that fact , and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx . 2 arcmin , we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can determine the location ( rotational ) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge of the all - sky map 's accuracy . pr material for the other three instrument give accuracy on the order of fraction of a degree , if that be any help . speak of GRO , the net - world probably be happy to see that the prep for orbit adjust appear to be go well . our branch guy who 's help out say that thing have go smoothly with the iso - valve prep and the burn will take place in mid - June . anyway , I'm off to find out more . 'be back when I get some info . ';2
447;' can a theist be truly objective ? can he be impartial when question the truth of his scripture , or will he assume the superstition of his parent when question ? I've often find it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wonder about God and his scripture . i've see it in the Christian , the Jew , the Muslim , and the other theist alike . all assume that their mother and father be right in the aspect that a god exist , and with that belief search for their god . occasionally , the theist may switch religion or aspect of the same religion , but overall the majority keep to the belief that some creator be behind the universe 's existence . I've know Muslims who be once Christians and vice versa , I've know Christians who be once jewish and vice versa , and I've even know Christians who become Hindu . yet , throughout their transition from one faith to another , they've keep this belief in some form of high be . why ? it usually all have to do with how the child be bring up . from the time he be bear , the theist be bring up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture-- the Bible , the Torah , the Qur'an ,  etc . he be tell of this wondrous God who write ( or inspire ) the scripture , of the prophet talk about in the scripture , of the miracle perform ,  etc . he be also tell that to question this ( as child be apt to do ) be a sin , a crime against God , and to lose belief in the scrip- ture 's truth be to damn one 's soul to Hell . thus , by the time he be able to read the scripture for himself , the belief in its truth be so ingrained in his mind it all seem a matter of course . but it doesn't stop there . once the child be able to read for himself , there be an endeavor to inculcate the child the right reading of scripture , to concentrate more on the pleasant reading , to gloss over the bad one , and to explain away the unexplainable with mystery . circular argument , self - evdent fact and truth , unreasoning belief , and fear of hell be the meat of religion the child must eat of every day . to doubt , of course , mean wrath of some sort , and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concern God . all of this have some considerable effect on the child , so that when he become an adult , the superstition he 's be teach be nearly impossible to remove . all of this lead I to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when question God , Hell , Heaven , the angel , soul , and all of the rest . can he , for a moment , put aside this notion that God  do  exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view ? obviously , most theist can somewhat , especially when present with mythical god ( Homeric , Roman , Egyptian ,  etc . ) . but can they put aside the assumption of God 's existence and question it impartially ?

I have test it use the Windows driver for HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both work fine . it accept either A or B sized paper . ( 8.5 x 11 or 11x17 ) . I figure that the plotter be worth about  300 and the pen be worth at least another  200 more .. one thing be certain , you won't need to purchase any pen for quite a while ... all of the package pen be seal so they be all still fresh . the rest be cap and seem to function as well . i'd be willing to sell the pen seperate if anyone be interested in just they .

866;'         note that a particular society , in this case the mainland UK ,     have few religously motivate murder , and few murder of  any      kind , say very little about whether inter - religion murder elsewhere     be religiously motivate .       no , but it allow one to conclude that there be nothing inherent    in all religion ( or for that matter , in catholicism and protestantism )    that motivate one to kill .   Motivates or allow ? the Christian Bible say that one may kill  under certain circumstance . in fact , it instruct one to kill under  certain circumstance . i'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instruct they to kill under certain circumstance . I do get your distinction between motivate and allow , and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows ' atoricitie , then that be an indictment of that theism . but it rather depend on what the 'certain circumstances ' be . when you talk about Christianity , or Islam , then at least your claim can be understand . It 's when people go to a general statement about theism that it fall apart . one could believe in a God which instruct one to be utterly harmless .     for my part , I conclude that something    else be require . I also happen to believe that that something    else will work no less well without religion - any easy they  Us will    do .   and what do religion supply , if not an easy they  Us ? not necessarily . Love thy neighbour do not supply a they  us - it demolish it . and my definition of religion be broad than my definition of theism , as I have explain .      by insist that even the murder of four labourer , choose because     they be catholic , and who have nothing to do with the IRA , by     protestant extremist , be  not  religously motivate , I think what     you be say be that you simply will not accept  any  murder as     be religiously motivate .       No . what about that guy who cut off someone 's head because he believe    he be the devil incarnate ? that be religously motivated .   what about the protestant extremist who kill four catholic  labourer ? that  wasn't  religiously motivate ? not in my opinion . if they be do it because of some obscure point of theology , then yes . but since all protestant don't do this ( nor do they elect extremist to do it for they ) , it 's just too broad too say religion do this . I'm say that the cause be far more complex than that - take away the religious element , and you'd still have the powerful motive of revenge and misguided patriotism . you know , when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the killing ' , one might listen to that , especially when you claim not to read mind .      also , the murder ensue from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie , the inquisition ,    and the many religous war .   What 's so special about these exception ? Isn't this all just a  grab - bag of ad - hoc excuse for not consider some other murder  to be religiously motivate ? What 's the general principle behind  all this ? the general principle be that it 's fairly clear ( to I , at least ) that religion be the primary motivator ( enabler , whatever ) of these . It 's not nearly so obvious what be go on when one look at NI , apart from violence of course .      It 's not an abstract argument . northern Irish Protestants say     we don't want to be absorb into be officially catholic country .         now what be we suppose to do ? be we suppose to reply no ,     that 's only what you think you don't want . Mr o'dwyer assure we     that no matter what you say you want , you really want something     else ?       you think the Unionists wouldn't mind be absorb into a non - catholic    country ( other than the UK of course ) ? It 's a terrible thing to lose    a mind . maybe the word country be there for more than just kick .    I certainly don't believe that the Unionists be in it for God - I think    they wish to maintain their position of privilege .   i'm still listen to what they say , and you be still tell we  your version of what they think . you read mind , and I don't . You've speculate on my motive often enough , and you don't take my statement of my own belief at face value - therefore your claim not to read mind have no credibility with I , sorry . I also note that you fail to answer my question . it just look to I very much like you have an axe to grind - especially as you be indeed ignore what most protestant say - which be stop the killing . the people you refer to be properly describe as unionist , not protestant .   as for their position of privilege , what be that if not religion-  base ? it be base on politic , bigotry , and heartless extremism . none of these thing be synonymous with religion , though there be certainly some overlap .

294;' well , this particular thread of vituperation slop its venom over into alt.atheism , where we spend most of our time entertain argument against our belief system , without resort to accuse other of bigotry . It 's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happen in this instance to have originate in rec.scoute , since I always understand scout to teach tolerance and diversity . I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race , religion , ethnic background , sex , or other inconsequential characteristic . all the evidence i've see indicate that sexual orientation and lack of belief in god be exactly such inconsequential characteristic . thus , pende further evidence , I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people be bigot , and organization that exclude such people be discriminatory .

Teapot ? ----------- display on Display column of IEEE CGA Jan '87 have the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell 's teapot . the article also have the bezi patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot . IEEE CGA Sep '87 in Jim Blinn 's column Jim Blinn 's Corner describe an another way to model the teapot- bezier curve with rotation for example be use . the OFF and SPD package have these object , so you're advise to get they to avoid type the datum yourself . the OFF datum be triangle at a specific resolution ( around 8x8x4 triangle  mesh per patch ) . the SPD package provide the spline patch description and perform a tessellation at any specify resolution . b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------ Tolis lerio  tolisnova.stanford.edu  have build a list of Space Shuttle datafile . Here be a summary ( from his sci.space list ): model1 : a modify version of the newsgroup model ( model2 ) 406 vertex ( 296 useful , i.e. refer to in the polygon description . ) 389 polygon ( 233 3 - vertex , 146 4 - vertex , 7 5 - vertex , 3 6 - vertex ) . payload door non - existent . unit : unknown . Simon Marshall ( S.Marshallsequent.cc.hull.ac.uk ) have a copy . he say there be no proprietary information associate with it . model2 : the newsgroup model , in OFF format . you can find it in gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub  off  object  shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu , pub  graphic  comp.graphic  object  shuttle.data model3 : the triangles ' model . this model be store in several file , each define portion of the model . Greg Henderson ( hendersinfonode.ingr.com ) have a copy . he do not mention any restriction on the model 's distribution . model4 : the NASA model . the file start off with a header line contain three real number , define the offset use by Lockheed in their simulation :  x offset   y offset   z offset  from then on , the file consist of a sequence of polygon description 3473 vertex . 2748 polygon ( 407 3 - vertex , 2268 4 - vertex , 33 5 - vertex , 14 6 - vertex , 10 7 - vertex , 8 8 - vertex , 8 12 - vertex , 2 13 - vertex , 2 15 - vertex , 17 16 - vertex , 2 17 - vertex , 2 18 - vertex , 3 19 - vertex , 8 24 - vertex ) . payload door close . unit : inch . Jon Berndt ( jonl14h11.jsc.nasa.gov ) seem to be responsible for the model proprietary info : unknown model5 : the old shuttle model . the file consist of a sequence of polygon description . 104 vertex . 452 polygon ( 11 3 - vertex , 41 4 - vertex ) . payload door open . unit : meter . we have be use this model at STAR Labs , Stanford University , for some year now . contact I ( tolisnova.stanford.edu ) or my supervisor Scott Williams ( scottstar5.stanford.edu ) if you want a copy .                                                                         16 . image annotation software                              a. Touchup run in Sunview and be pretty good . it read in rasterfile , but even if your image isn't normally store in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a rasterfile . b. Idraw ( part of Stanford 's InterViews distribution ) can handle some image format in addition to be a MacDraw like tool . I'm not sure exactly what they be . you can ftp the idraw 's binary from interviews.stanford.edu . c. Tgif be another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap ( xbm ) and X11 pixmap ( xpm ) format . if the image you have be in format other than xbm or xpm , you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert thing like gif or even some Macintosh format to xpm .

IDL  SIPS -------- a lot of people be use IDL with a package call sips . this be develop at the University of Colorado ( Boulder ) by some people work for Alex Goetz . you might try contact they if you already have IDL or would be willing to buy it . It 's a few thousand dollar ( American ) I expect for IDL and the other should be free . those be the general purpose package i've hear of , besides what TerraMar have . sip  be  write for AVIRIS imagery . I'm not sure how general purpose it be . you would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask . I have another piece of software ( PCW ) that do pc and Walsh transformation with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification ( you can compute an image use select component ) . I've use it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS image without problem , but for the good speed you need an external DSP card . it will work without it , but large image take quite a while ( 50 - 70 time as long ) to process . That be a freebie if you want it my favorite be IDL ( Interactive Data Language ) from Research Systems , Inc. IDL be in my opinion , much well and infinitely easy . its programming language be very strong and easy -- very Pascal - like . it handle the number - crunch very well , also . personally , I like do the number - crunch with IDL on the VAX ( or Mathematica , Igor , or even Excel on the Mac if it be not too hairy ) , then bring it over to NIH image for the imaging part . I have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn't handle , and the speed and ease of use ( compare to IRAF ) be incredible . by the way , it 's mostly astronomical image processing which i've be do . this mean image enhancement , clean up bad line  pixel , and some other traditional image processing routine . then , for example , take a graph of intensity versus position along a line I choose with the mouse , then do a curve fit to that line ( which I might do like in KaleidaGraph . )  for idl call Research Systems , for pv - wave call Precision Visuals and for sips call University of Colorado  Boulder . from what I can understand , you can get package program from Research Systems , though -- nfotis  Visual3 ------- contact Robert Haimes , MIT FieldView --------- an interactive program design to assist an engineer in investigate fluid dynamic data set . platform : SGI , IBM , HP , SUN , X - terminal availability : currently available on all of the above platform . educational program and volume discount be available . contact : Intelligent Light P.O.

MindTool be a tool provide for the interactive graphic manipulation of molecule and atom . currently , up to 10,000 atom may be input . available via anonymous FTP , at rani.chem.yale.edu , directory pub  MindTool ( check with Archie for other site if that 's too far )  I would also suggest look at least in SGI 's Applications Directory . it contain many more package - nfotis                                                                             19 . gis ( Geographical Information Systems software )                                                    GRASS ----- ( Geographic Resource Analysis Support System ) of the US Army Construction Engineering Research Lab ( CERL ) . it be a popular geographic and remote sense image processing package . many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image processing package , although it be report to have significant image processing capability . Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it 's public domain and can be obtain through the internet for free . GRASS run in Unix and be write in C. the source code can be obtain through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass Integration . you then compile the source code for your machine , use script provide with GRASS . I would recommend GRASS for someone who already have a workstation and be on a limited budget . GRASS be not very user - friendly , compare to Macintosh software . a first review of overview documentation indicate that it look useful and have some pixel resample function not in other package plus good general purpose image enhancement routine ( fft ) . Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in Boulder , CO be a primary user of GRASS . this gentleman have use the GRASS software and developed multi - spectral ( 238 band ? ? ) volumetric rendering , full color , on Suns and Stardents . it be a really effective interface . Vexcel Corp. currently have a contract to map part of Venus and convert the Magellan radar datum into contour map . you can call they at ( 303 ) 444 - 0094 or email care of gregvexcel.com 192.92.90.68 Host Configuration Requirements if you be willing to run A  UX you could install GRASS on a Macintosh which have significant image analysis and import capability for satellite datum . GRASS be public - domain , and can run on a high - end pc under UNIX . it be raster - base , have some image - processing capability , and can display vector datum ( but analysis must be do in the raster environment ) . I have use GRASS v.3 on a SUN workstation and find it easy to use . it be good , of course , for datum that be well represent in raster ( grid - cell ) form . availability CERL 's Office of Grass Integration ( OGI ) maintain an ftp server : moon.cecer.army.mil ( 129.229.20.254 ) . Mail regard this site should be address to grass-ftp-adminmoon.cecer.army.mil . this location will be the new canonical source for GRASS software , as well as bug fix , contribute source , documentation , and other file . this FTP server also support dynamic compression and uncompression and tar archive of file . a feature attraction of the server be John Parks ' GRASS tutorial . because the manual be still in beta - test stage , John request that people only acquire it if they be willing to review it and mail he comment  correction . the ogi be not currently maintain this document , so all correspondence about it should be direct to grassxtang.uark.edu Support Listserv mailing list : grassu-listamber.cecer.army.mil ( for GRASS users- application - level question , support concern , miscellaneous question , etc ) send subscribe command to grassu-requestamber.cecer.army.mil . grassp-listamber.cecer.army.mil ( for GRASS programmers- system - level question and tip , trick , and technique of design and implementation of GRASS application ) send subscribe command to grassp-requestamber.cecer.army.mil . both list be maintain by the Office of Grass Integration ( subset of the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in Champaign , IL ) . the ogi be provide the list as a service to the community- while ogi and CERL employee will participate in the list , we can make no claim as to content or veracity of message that pass through the list . if you have question , problem , or comment , send e - mail to lists-owneramber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond . Microstation Imager ------------------- Intergraph ( base in Huntsville Alabama ) sell a wide range of gis software  hardware . microstation be a base graphic package that Imager sit on top of . Imager be basically an image processing package with a heavy GIS  remote sense flavor . Feature Description basic geometry manipulation : flip , mirror , rotate , generalize affine . rectification : Affine , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th order model as well as a projective model ( warp an image to a vector map or to another image ) . RGB to IHS and ihs to RGB conversion . Principal component analysis . classification : k - mean and isodata . Fourier Xforms : forward , filtering and reverse . filter : high pass , low pass , edge enhancing , median , generic . Complex Histogram  Contrast control . Layer Controller : manage up to 64 image at a time -- user can extract single band from a 3 band image or create color image by combine various individual band , etc . the package be design for a remote sense application ( it can handle very large image ) and there be all kind of other software available for gis application . Host Configuration Requirements it run on Intergraph Workstations ( a Unix machine similar to a Sun ) though there be rumor ( there be always rumor ) that the software would be port to pc and possibly a Sun environment . PCI --- a company call PCI , Inc. , out of Richmond Hill , Ontario , Canada , make an array of software utility for processing , manipulation , and use of remote sense datum in eight or ten different industry standard format : LGSOWG , BSQ , LANDSAT , and a couple of other whose title I forget . the software be available in version for MS - DOS , Unix workstation ( among they HP , Sun , and IBM ) , and VMS , and quite possibly other platform by now . I use the VMS version . the PCI software consist of several class  group  package of utility , group by function but all operate on a common pci database disk file . the Tape I  o package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote - sense industry tape format INTO , or write those format out from , the PCI database file- this be the only package I use or know much about . other package can display datum from the PCI database to one or another of several pci - support third - party color display , output numeric or bitmap representation of image datum to an attached printer , e.g. an Epson - type dot - matrix graphic printer . you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operation package : histo- gram and Fourier analysis , equalization , user - specify operation ( e.g. multiply channel 1 by 3 , add channel 2 , and store as channel 5 ) , and God only know what all else -- there 's a LOT . I don't have and don't use these , so can't say much about them- you only buy the package your particular application  interest call for . each utility be control by from one to eight parameter , read from a common parameter file which must be ( in VMS anyway ) in your default directory . some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose , so it can get a bit confusing set up a series of operation . the standard PCI environment contain a scripting language very similar to IBM - pc BASIC , but which allow you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common , complicated , lengthy or difficult series of utility execution . ( in VMS I can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure . ) There 's also an optional programming library which allow you to write compile language program which can interface with ( read from  write to ) the PCI datum structure ( database file , parameter file ) . the PCI software be design specifically for remote - sense image , but require such a level of operator expertise that , once you reach the level where you can handle r - s image , you can figure out way to handle a few other thing as well . for instance , the Tape I  o package offer a utility for read headerless multi - band ( what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh call raw ) datum from tape , in a number of different interleave order . this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic - art industry 's CT2 T format , would probably ( I haven't try ) handle Targa , and so on . above all , however , you have to know what YOU'RE do or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over . It 's worth note that the PCI database file be design to contain not only raster ( image ) datum , but vector ( for overlay map information enter via digitize table ) , land - use , and all manner of other information ( I observe that a remote - sense image tape often contain all manner of information about the spectral band , latitude , longitude , time , date , etc . of the original satellite pass- all of this can go into the PCI database ) . I  believe  that on workstation the build - in display be use . on VAX system other than workstation pci support only a couple of specific third - party display system ( the name Gould  Deanza seem to come to mind ) . one of MY personal workaround be a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a Peritek VCT - Q ( Q - bus 24 - bit DirectColor ) display subsystem . pci software could be overkill in your case- it seems design for the very high end application  user , i.e. those for whom a Mac  PC largely doesn't suffice ( although as you know the gap be get small all the time ) . It 's probably no coincidence that PCI be locate in Canada , a country which do a LOT of its land  resource management via remote sensing- I believe the canadian government use PCI software for some of its work in these area . SPAM ( Spectral Analysis Manager ) -------------------------------- back in 1985 JPL develop something call SPAM ( Spectral Analysis Manager ) which get a fair amount of use at the time . that be design for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery ( byte datum ,   256 pixel across by   512 line by   256 bands)- a modify version have since be develop for AVIRIS ( Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer ) which use much large image . Spam do none of these thing ( rectification , classification , pc and IHS transformation , filtering , contrast enhancement , overlay ) . actually , it do limit filtering and contrast enhancement ( stretching ) . Spam be aim at spectral identification and clustering . the original Spam use X or SunView to display . the AVIRIS version may require VICAR , an executive base on TAE , and may also require a frame buffer . I can refer you to people if you're interested . PCW require x for display . MAP II ------ among the Mac gis system , MAP II be distribute by John Wiley . CLRview ------- clrview be a 3 - dimensional visualization program design to exploit the real - time capability of Silicon Graphics IRIS computer . this program be design to provide a core set of tool to aid in the visualization of information from CAD and gis source . it support the integration of many common but disperate datum source such as DXF , TIN , DEM , Lattices , and Arc  Info Coverages among other . clrview can be obtain from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca ( 128.100.1.129 ) in the directory pub  sgi  clrview . contact : Rodney Hoinkes Head of Design Applications Centre for Landscape Research University of Toronto Tel : ( 416 ) 978 - 7197 email : rodneydgp.utoronto.ca                                                                           end of Resource Listing ';1

187;' I plan to post a summary of response to this as soon as I have work code , which I will also include . the intersection of 3 plane method look good , but my implementation base on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work . I may be misinterpret , of course . I have avoid the simultaneous solution of the plane equation in favor of dot and cross product , but the former may actually be well . in either case a matrix determinant need to be compute ( implicitly in the solution of linear equation ) . to get the plane , I be take the midpoint of the line from , say , P1 to P2 , and set the normal as the normalize vector from P1 to P2 . these just plug into the formula in Graphics Gems . however , the result center point be only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test point ( for different test ) . my matrix  vector math be very rusty , but it look like I need to verify the formula , or use the simultaneous equation solution , which will require bring in another routine I don't have ( but should be easy to find ) . another method be to first find the center of the circle define by 2 set of 3 point , and intersect the normal from there . this would also define the circle center . however , small numerical imprecision would make the line not intersect . supposedly 3 plane have to intersect in a unique point if they be not parallel .

74;' I once read an article on Computer technology which state that every new computer technology be actually low and slow then what it replace . Silicon be less effective then the germanium product then available . GaAs be less capable then Silicon . Multi - processor be slow then existent single processor . what the argument be , though be that these new technology promise either theoretically future high performance or low cost or high density . I think that the DC-1 may g  fit into this same model . ELV 's can certainly launch more weight then a SSRT , but an SSRT offer the prospect of great cycle time and low cost . this be kind of a speculative posting , but I think i'd throw it out as a hjistorical framework for those interested in the project .

1287;' archive - name : space  schedule last - modify :  date : 930401 14:39:23  SPACE SHUTTLE answer , LAUNCH SCHEDULES , TV COVERAGE SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS and landings- schedule and how to see they Shuttle operation be discuss in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle , and Ken Hollis ( gandalfpro-electric.cts.com ) post a compress version of the shuttle manifest ( launch date and other information ) periodically there . the manifest be also available from the Ames SPACE archive in SPACE  FAQ  manifest . the portion of his manifest formerly include in this FAQ have be removed- please refer to his posting or the archived copy . for the most up to date information on upcoming mission , call ( 407 ) 867 - INFO ( 867 - 4636 ) at Kennedy Space Center . Official NASA shuttle status report be post to sci.space.news frequently . why do the SHUTTLE ROLL just after liftoff ? the following answer and translation be provide by Ken Jenks ( kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ) . the Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual , ASC GC 2102 , tdure the vertical rise phase , the launch pad attitude be tcommande until an i - load V(rel ) sufficient to assure launch tower tclearance be achieve . then , the tilt maneuver ( roll program ) torient the vehicle to a head down attitude require to generate a tnegative q - alpha , which in turn alleviate structural loading . other tadvantages with this attitude be performance gain , decrease abort tmaneuv complexity , improve S - band look angle , and crew view of tthe horizon . the tilt maneuver be also require to start gain tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff ( MECO ) target tin second stage . this really be a good answer , but it 's couch in NASA jargon . I'll try to interpret . 1)twe wait until the Shuttle clear the tower before roll . 2)tThen , we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack tbetween the wind cause by passage through the atmosphere ( the trelative wind ) and the chord of the wing ( the imaginary line tbetween the leading edge and the trail edge ) be a slightly tnegative angle ( a negative q - alpha).tthis cause a little bit of tdownward force ( toward the belly of the Orbiter , or the  z tdirection ) and this force alleviate structural loading . twe have to be careful about those wing -- they're about the tmost delicate part of the vehicle . 3)tthe new attitude ( after the roll ) also allow we to carry more tmass to orbit , or to achieve a high orbit with the same mass , or tto change the orbit to a high or low inclination than would be tthe case if we didn't roll ( performance gain ) . 4)tthe new attitude allow the crew to fly a less complicated tflight path if they have to execute one of the more dangerous abort tmaneuvers , the Return to Launch Site ( decrease abort maneuver tcomplexity ) . 5)tthe new attitude improve the ability for ground - base radio tantennae to have a good line - of - sight signal with the S - band radio tantennae on the Orbiter ( improve S - band look angle ) . 6)tthe new attitude allow the crew to see the horizon , which be a thelpful ( but not mandatory ) part of pilot any fly machine . 7)tthe new attitude orient the shuttle so that the body be tmore nearly parallel with the ground , and the nose to the east t(usually ) . this allow the thrust from the engine to add velocity tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit . remember : tvelocity be a vector quantity make of both speed and direction . tthe Shuttle have to have a large horizontal component to its tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit . this all beg the question , why isn't the launch pad orient to give this nice attitude to begin with ? why do the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude ? the answer be that the pad be leftover from the Apollo day . the Shuttle straddle two flame trench -- one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust , one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust . ( you can see the effect of this on any daytime launch . the SRM exhaust be dirty gray garbage , and the SSME exhaust be fluffy white steam . watch for the difference between the top  orbiter side  and the bottom  External Tank side  of the stack . ) the access tower and other support and service structure be all orient basically the same way they be for the Saturn V 's . ( a side note : the Saturn V 's also have a roll program . don't ask I why -- I'm a Shuttle guy . ) I check with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.tHe add that the roll maneuver be really a maneuver in all three axis : roll , pitch and yaw . the roll component of that maneuver be perform for the reason state . the pitch component control loading on the wing by keep the angle of attack ( q - alpha ) within a tight tolerance . the yaw component be use to determine the orbital inclination . the total maneuver be really express as a quaternion , a grad - level - math concept for combine all three rotation matrix in one four - element array . how to receive the NASA tv CHANNEL , NASA SELECT NASA SELECT be broadcast by satellite . if you have access to a satellite dish , you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R , Transponder 13 , C - Band , 72 degree West Longitude , Audio 6.8 , Frequency 3960 mhz .

I agree with that . but what do that have to do with Jesus ? punishment you say ? Jesus do not regard his death as punishment . Good . I wouldn't either -- not the way you understand it . ask Jesus himself . he himself say why in John 12:23 - 32 . it isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly be no need for a persuasive argument . Read Jesus 's own reply to your question . Jesus give more reason in John 16:7 . but one obvious reason why Jesus die , ( and as with everything else , it have nothing do with his punishment ) be that he could rise to life again -- so that we would stop doubt and believe ( John 21:27 ) . the fact that Jesus rise from the dead be my hope that I too will rise from the dead . it be an obvious point . do not overlook it . without this obvious point , I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity . why do Jesus suffer in his death ? again , ask Jesus . Jesus say why in John 15:18 - 25 . That 's no mystery either . the world hate he without reason . it be a direct proclamation of how far we human botch thing up and thus , how much we need a saviour . ';3

1289;' in the King James Version of the Bible there be three different word translate into the word hell . these greek word have totally different meaning . the word be Hades , Tartaros , and Gehenna . in bibical usage , the greek word Hades be use only 11 time in the New Testament , and be roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol ... mean the grave or pit ( compare act 2:27 with Psalms 16:10 ) . Hades may be liken to a hole in the ground . ( in the Bible it have nothing to do with fire ! ) Most modern bibical translator admit that the use in the english word hell to translate Hades and Sheol be an unfortunate and misleading practice . why ? because when see the word hell many reader impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever - burn inferno , when this be never remotely intend in the greek language or in Old English ! in its true bibical usage Hades do indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead , but not in the sense of spirit walk around in some sort of shadowy realm . Hades be simply the abode we call the grave . all dead go to this hell . the second hell of the Bible , Tartaros , be mention only once in scripture , 2 pet.2:4- for if God spare not the angel that sin , but cast they down to hell ( TARTAROS ) , and deliver they into chain of darkness to be reserve unto judgment ... follow their rebellion to unseat God from his throne ( Isa.14:12 - 14- Rev.12:4 ) , the archangel Lucifer ( now Satan ) and a third of the create angel ( now demon ) be eject from heaven ( Luke 10:18 ) . they be cast down to tartaro , a place or condition of restraint that God have impose on the mutinous angel as they await ultimate judgment ( Jude 6- 1 Cor.6:3 ) . tartaro , then , be a hell that apply only to evil , rebellious angel or demon ( it be interesting that the ancient Greeks use this word to describe the place in which Zeus confine the rebellious Titans ) . nowhere in the Bible be there any mention of man be put into this particular hell . the the third word that be translate as hell in the Bible be Gehenna . it come from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM , mean valley of Hinniom . Hinnom be a deep , narrow ravine locate to the south and southwest of Jerusalem . in Old Testament time it be a place of abominable pagan rite , include infant sacrifice ( it be there that the apostate king Ahaz and Manasseh make their child pass through the fire to the god Molech . the rite be specifically celebrate in Tophet , the place of abhorrence , one of the chief grove in the valley ) . King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abomination . he defile the valley , render it ceremonially unclean ( 2 king 23:10 ) . later the valley become the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem- a repository for sewage , refuse and animal carcass . the body of dispise criminal be also burn there along with the rubbish . fire burn continuously , feed by a constant supply of garbage and refuse . Aceldama , the field of blood , purchase with the money Judas receive for the betrayal of Christ ( Matt.27:8 ) be also in part of the valley of Hinnom . so what do this valley call Gehenna have to do with hell ? in Rev.19:20 : the Satan inspire political dictator and a miracle - work religious figure , the False Prophet , work with he will resist the re - establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at his second coming . their fate be reveal by the apostle John : and the beast be take , and with he the false prophet ... these both be cast alive into a lake of fire burn with brimstone . where will this temporary lake of fire ( this hell ) be ? the prophet Isaiah write of this lake of fire prepare for the Beast : for Tophet ( in the valley of Hinnom ) be ordain of old , yea for the king it be prepare , he hath make it deep and large , the pile thereof be fire and wood , the breath of the Lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it ( Isa.30:33 ) . one thousand year later , Satan himself will be cast into this rekindle fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet be cast ! ( Rev.20:10 ) . but what of the wicked who have die over the millennia ? do the Bible say that they be now suffer fiery punishment for their sin in a lake of fire ? in the sequence of rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked be resurrect to be throw into the lake of fire after Satan be cast there ! ( rev.20:15 ) . what will become of these wicked ? will they writhe in flame for eternity ? the wicked will be burn up from the intense heat of the come Gehenna fire on the earth . they wil be consume , annihilate , destroy ! this punishment will be everlaste ( permanent and final ) . the Bible call it the second death ( Rev.20:14- 21:8 ) , from which there be no possibility of a further resurrection . the Bible do teach eternal punishment , but not eternal punishing . the prophet Malachi provide a graphic description . for , behold , the day cometh that shall burn as an oven , and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly , shall be stubble , and the day that cometh shall burn they up ... ( 4:1 ) . to the righteous , God say that the wicked shall be ashe under the sol of your foot ... (mal.4:3 ) . Gehenna be a place of destruction and death , not a place of live torture ! Jesus be talk to Jews who understand all about this Gehenna or valley of Hinnom . utter destruction by fire be complete . nothing be leave , but ashe ! every text in the Bible translate from this greek word Gehenna mean complete destruction , not live torture ( not eternal life in torment ) ! the Bible say , in Romans 6:23 , the wage of sin be death , not eternal life in torture . the punishment reveal in the Bible be death ... the cessation of life .

Atkin Ave . , Salt Lake City , Utah 84106 . this be the organization that be start to promote Larson 's theory . they have other related publication , include the quarterly journal RECIPROCITY . Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson be a retired engineer ( Chemical or Electrical ) . he be about 91 year old when he die in May 1989 . he have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University . he develop his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical property base only on the element use . Larson 's lack of a fancy ph.d. degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore he , but it be not a VALID reason . sometimes it take a relative outsider to CLEARLY see the forest through the TREES . at the same time , it be clear from his book that he also know ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer , well enough to point out all their contradiction , AD HOC assumption , principle of IMPOTENCE , IN - CONSISTENCIES , ETC .. Larson do not have the fund , etc . to experimentally test his theory . and it be not necessary for he to do so . he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researchers ' experimental and observational datum . and in many case , his explanation FIT BETTER . a self - consistent theory be much MORE than the ORTHODOX physicist and astronomer have ! they claim to be look for a unified field theory that work , but have be ignore one for over 30 year now ! modern physics do not explain the physical universe so well . some part of some of Larson 's book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree . and remember that epicycle , crystal sphere , geocentricity , flat earth theory , etc . , also once seem to explain it well , but be later prove CONCEPTUALLY wrong . Prof. Frank H. Meyer , Professor Emeritus of UW - Superior , be  be a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson 's theory , and be ( or still be ) President of Larson 's organization , the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY of UNIFIED SCIENCE , and Editor of their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY . he move to Minneapolis after retire . Super Collider BOONDOGGLE ! I be against contruction of the Superconducting Super Collider , in Texas or anywhere else . it would be a gross WASTE of money , and contribute almost nothing of scientific value . Most physicist don't realize it , but , accord to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson , as describe in his book , the strange GOOFY particle ( meson , hyperon , ALLEGED quark , etc . ) which they be find in existing collider ( Fermi Lab , Cern , etc . ) be really just ATOMS of ANTI - MATTER , which be create by the high - energy colliding beam , and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment . a large and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti - matter that the physicist have not see there before , and the physicist will be even more confuse than they be now ! be a few more type of anti - matter atom worth the  8.3 billion cost ? ! ! don't we have much more important use for this waste money ? ! another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in Texas have a serious and grow problem with some kind of fire ant eat the insulation off underground cable . how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the Supercollider ? ! name the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon , as propose , be TOTALLY ABSURD ! if it be build , it should be name after a lead particle physicist . LARSONIAN Anti - Matter in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe , anti - matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle . it have more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make , in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light , which Larson call Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum . in Larson 's theory , a positron be actually a particle of MATTER , not anti - matter . when a positron and electron meet , the rotational vibration ( charge ) and rotation of their respective photon ( of which they be make ) neutralize each other . in Larson 's theory , the ANTI - matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of TIME , and only one dimension of space , and exist in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half . LARSONIAN Relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury have be observe and precisely measure to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 second of arc per century . 531 second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet ( Venus , Earth , Jupiter , etc . ) . the remain 43 second of arc be be use to help prove Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity . but the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieve result close to the 43 second than General Relativity can , by instead use SPECIAL relativity . in one or more of his book , he apply the LORENTZ transformation on the high orbital speed of Mercury . Larson TOTALLY reject General Relativity as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY . he also reject most of Special Relativity , include the part about mass increase near the speed of light , and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shift , ( those quasar with red - shift great than 1.000 REALLY be move fast than the speed of light , although most of that motion be away from we in TIME . ) . in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe , there be three dimension of time instead of only one . but two of those dimension can not be measure from our material half of the physical universe . the one dimension that we can measure be the CLOCK time . at low relative speed , the value of the other two dimension be NEGLIGIBLE- but at high speed , they become significant , and the Lorentz Transformation must be use as a FUDGE FACTOR .  Larson often use the term coordinate TIME when write about this .  in regard to mass increase , it have be prove in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light . but the formula for acceleration be acceleration  FORCE  MASS , ( a  F  m ) . Orthodox physicist be ignore the THIRD factor : FORCE . in Larson 's theory , mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drop toward zero . FORCE be actually a motion , or combination of motion , or relation between motion , include INward and OUTward SCALAR motion . the expansion of the universe , for example , be an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so - call Big Bang ( which be yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY ) . the UNIVERSE of MOTION I wish to recommend to everyone the book the UNIVERSE of MOTION , by Dewey B. Larson , 1984 , North Pacific Publishers , ( P.O. Box 13255 , Portland , Oregon 97213 ) , 456 page , index , hardcover . it contain the astrophysical portion of a GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by that author , an UNrecognized geniu , more than thirty year ago . it contain FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery , include the FORMATION of galaxy , binary and multiple star system , and solar system , the true ORIGIN of the 3 - degree background radiation , cosmic ray , and gamma- ray burst , and the true nature of quasar , pulsar , white dwarf , explode galaxy , etc .. it contain what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for , if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind ! the following be an example of his Theory 's success : in his first book in 1959 , the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE , Larson predict the existence of EXPLODING galaxy , several year before astronomer start find they . they be a NECESSARY consequence of Larson 's comprehensive theory . and when QUASARS be discover , he have an immediate relate explanation for they also . GAMMA - RAY BURSTS Astro - physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious GAMMA - RAY BURSTS . they be originally think to originate from neutron star in the disc of our galaxy . but the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit have be detect they in all direction uniformly , and their source location in space do not correspond to any known object , ( except for a few case of directional coincidence ) . Gamma - ray burst be a NECESSARY consequence of the GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson . accord to page 386 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION , publish in 1984 , the gamma - ray burst be come from SUPERNOVA explosion in the ANTI - matter HALF of the physical universe , which Larson call the Cosmic Sector . because of the relationship between the anti - matter and material half of the physical universe , and the way they be connect together , the gamma - ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space , seemingly at random . ( this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with known object , and come from all direction uniformly . ) I wonder how close to we in space a source location would have to be for a gamma - ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth ! there would be no way to predict one , nor to stop it ! perhaps some of the MASS extinction of the past , which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid , be actually cause by nearby GAMMA - RAY BURSTS ! LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double . but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of they . but binary star system be actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson . I will try to summarize Larsons explanation , which be detail in chapter 7 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION and in some of his other book . first of all , accord to Larson , star do not generate energy by fusion . a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse . the rest result from the COMPLETE annihilation of heavy element ( heavy than IRON ) . each element have a destructive TEMPERATURE LIMIT . the heavy the element be , the low be this limit . a star 's internal temperature increase as it grow in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray , gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of light and light element . when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of IRON , there be a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION ! this be because there be so much iron present- and that be relate to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process , which Larson explain in some of his book  well than I can  . when the star explode , the light material on the outer portion of the star be blow outward in space at less than the speed of light . the heavy material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light , because of the high temperature . the explosion push that material over the speed of light , and it expand OUTWARD in TIME , which be equivalent to inward in SPACE , and it often actually disappear for a while . over long period of time , both masse start to fall back gravitationally . the material that have be blow outward in space now start to form a red GIANT star . the material that have be blow OUTWARD in TIME start to form a WHITE DWARF star . both star then start move back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the H - R Diagram . the chance of the two masse fall back into the exact same location in space , make a single lone star again , be near zero . they will instead form a BINARY system , orbit each other . accord to Larson , a white dwarf star have an inverse DENSITY gradient ( be dense at its SURFACE ) , because the material at its center be most widely disperse ( blow outward ) in time . this eliminate the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL fantasy about degenerate matter , neutron star , black hole , etc .. LARSONIAN Solar System Formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small , then , instead of a single white dwarf star , there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf star ( revolve around the red giant star , but probably still too far away in three - dimensional time to be affect by its heat , etc . ) . these will become PLANETS ! in chapter 7 of the UNIVERSE of MOTION , Larson use all this information , and other principle of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe , to derive his own version of bode 's Law . Black Hole FANTASY ! I hear that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black hole merge together into a single black hole , and conclude that the new black hole would have MORE mass than the sum of the two original black hole . such a result should be recognize by everyone as a RED FLAG , cause widespread doubt about the whole IDEA of black hole , etc . ! after read Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe , especially his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION , it be clear to I that black hole be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL fantasy ! the strange object at Cygnus X-1 be just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR , not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to prove their theory . by the way , I do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist Stephen Hawking . the physicist and astronomer seem to be act as if Hawking 's severe physical problem somehow make he wise . it do not ! I wish the same attention have be give to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he be still alive . widespread publicity and attention should now be give to Larson 's theory , book , and organization ( the International Society of Unified Science ) . ELECTRO - MAGNETIC PROPULSION I hear of that concept many year ago , in connection with UFO 's and unorthodox inventor , but I never be able to find out how or why they work , or how they be construct . I find a possible clue about why they might work on page 112 - 113 of the book BASIC property of MATTER , by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson , which describe part of Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe . I quote one paragraph : as indicate in the precede chapter , the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrive at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance . the electron , we find , be derive from the environment . it be bring out in volume I  Larson 's book nothing but MOTION  that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity , and that , although the motion that constitute these electron be , in many case , absorb by atomic structure , the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited . it follow that there be always a large excess of free electron in the material sector  material half  of the universe , most of which be uncharged . in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space , because they be inherently rotate unit of space , and the relation of space to space be not motion . in open space , therefore , each uncharged electron remain permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system , in the manner of a photon . in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron , like the photon , be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system . all material aggregate be thus expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation . meanwhile there be other process , to be discuss later , whereby electron be return to the environment . the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilize at an equilibrium level . note that in Larson 's theory , UNcharged electron be also massLESS , and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency ( above the unit frequency ) spin around one axis at a particular rate ( below the unit rate ) . ( unit velocity be the speed of light , and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light , accord to Larson 's theory . )  I might have the above and below label mix up .  Larson be say that outer space be fill with mass- LESS UN - charge electron fly around at the speed of light ! if this be true , then the ELECTRO - MAGNETIC propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron , or other particle in space , perhaps give they a charge ( and mass ) and shoot they toward the rear to achieve propulsion . ( in Larson 's theory , an electrical charge be a one - dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency ( above the unit frequency ) superimpose on the rotation of the particle . ) the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confused meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud . suppression of LARSONIAN Physics the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson have be available for more than 30 year , publish in 1959 in his first book the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE . it be TOTALLY UN - SCIENTIFIC for Hawking , Wheeler , Sagan , and the other sacred priest of the religion they call science ( or physic , or astronomy , etc . ) , as well as the scientific literature and the education system , to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson 's theory have they have . Larson 's theory have excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer , such as gamma - ray burst and the nature of quasar . Larson 's theory deserve to be HONESTLY and openly discuss in the physics , chemistry , and astronomy journal , in the U.S. and elsewhere . and at least the basic principle of Larson 's theory should be include in all related course at UW - EC , UW - Madison , Cambridge , Cornell University , and elsewhere , so that student be not keep in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they be be feed . for more information , answer to your question , etc . , please consult my cited source ( especially Larson 's BOOKS ) . UN - altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this important partial summary be ENCOURAGED . ';2
764;' (hudson ) Yes you do . who be to say that it be immoral for onesself to experience pain or to be hurt in some other way . maybe unpleasant , but that doesn't say anything about morality . it violate free will , Hudson . ( me ) (hudson ) Why be make someone a less productive member of society immoral ? Hudson , you be screw up again . Morality do not ( I say again , do not ) define only right and wrong . it also define acceptable social behavior , without any overtone of good and evil . pick up your trash be not really a right  wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good and Evil . yet it be moral in the sense that it be acceptable social behavior . your definition of the word morality be what be cause you to trip over yourself here . (me ) And since I , selfish be that I be , want to maximize my gain from society , I will not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down on how much benefit I can derive from society . (hudson ) Why be your benefit somehow relate to morality . again , your definition be cause you to shoot yourself in the foot . (hudson ) What about if someone feel that their own personal benefit be enhance more than it would be damage by deplete the overall resource of society ? maybe something might hurt society , but it would help he immensly ? that be irrational thinking . there may also be people out there who think that death by atomic destruction be a sublime and wonderful thing . I be not go to let they execute that idea just because they want to do it . simply because I let people make up their mind about what moral they have doesn't prevent I from spot and stop a madman when I see one , Hudson . and even then , I will only stop he when he interfere with I and my life . that be the difference between I and you : you want to interfere in people 's life even when they aren't affect you . (hudson ) The central character in Dostoevsky 's novel , crime and Punishment , (r something or other ) reason that if kill this old jewish woman and stole her money to educate and establish himself financially , he could make a great contribution to society . he reason that she be not of much profit to society . she just collect rent , and hoard money . one of the central point of any ( that 's ANY ) moral system be that be have to be internally consistent . by kill she , the character have to accept the premise that the end justify the mean . if he accept that premise , then ( in order to be consistent ) , he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to his life . now , if he be unwilling to accept this premise ( which he will not be willing to accept ) , then he have behave inconsistently with his own moral standard . (me ) football example delete  (hudson ) now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the player in the field  on the court be injure ( or kill . ) this freshman want to play in the big game so a talent scout can see he . if he hurt a player on the team , it might slightly lessen the chance of the team to win , but he might gain great personal benefit . so , operate on purely selfish ( immorally selfish ) motive , he arrange for a sniper to shoot a team player in the leg . he get to play in front of the talent scout . Did that freshman behave morally ? selfish intention may sometimes generate ( apparently ) moral action , but not always . two problem right off the bat : 1 . the problem with your analogy be that it doesn't address the goal that I start with : win the game . play in front of the talent scout !  win the game . try create the same analogy and keep the ultimate goal the same , will you ?

1798;' let I begin by say I think this be the world 's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium . therefore , even if this religion do not take off , its found member will be very important historically as this method of solicit membership will eventually become common . the basis of this religion be to apply various aspect of current conventional morality to the character in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the bible 's account of the fact and historical event be correct . for example , Story of Adam and Eve : Adam and Eve be in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant . have unlimited supply of food provide , but no clothing , job , or knowledge . God say not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge . they do anyway , then try to hide in bush . God find they and force they out of Garden . ( there be several different story on what they be do while naked in the bush that might have anger God . ) Traditional Philosophy : 1 . the only reason you need knowledge or a job be to eat . if someone else will provide you with food , then you can be stupid and unemployed and it 's ok . this be why married woman usually didn't work until recent decade . 2 . authority figure , such as God , whoever be behind the Vietnam War , Hitler and slaveowner , be always right and should be blindly follow without question by ordinary people , who can't make decision for themselves . interpretation of event base on Traditional Philosophy : they be not suppose to eat the fruit . they should have do whatever God tell they to . like small child , they have their need provide for and be obligate to do whatever their Father say to . be force to leave the Garden and work in order to obtain food be a punishment . lesson from Traditional Interpretation : 1 . ignorance be good . Knowledge be bad , but tempting . 2 . have food provide for you for nothing ( read welfare ) be ideal . get- te a job and feed yourself with what you earn be punishment . 3 . public nudity be good . cover up be bad . 4 . Authority figure be intrinsically right . normal people be dumb and should do whatever they be tell without question . they should not think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate position be especially obligate to refrain from learn . for example , it should be illegal for slave to learn to read . 1990 's philosophy : 1 . People should seek education and employment outside the home , unless name Hillary Clinton or Murphy Brown . 2 . People should use common sense . they should not kill other people ( bind of Issac , war , Holocaust , etc . ) just because they be tell to . Interpretation of event base on current philosophy : they be suppose to eat the fruit . God gave want they to seek knowledge rather than be hand it on a silver platter . once they have gain knowledge and ( by seek it ) show their ability to make mature decision for them- self , they no long need to be treat like little child and be rewarded by be allow into the real world . lesson from new interpretation : 1 . ignorance be bad . Knowledge be good , but must be seek . 2 . have food provide for you for nothing ( read welfare ) be at good a temporary measure . get a job and feed yourself with what you earn be ideal . 3 . public nudity be bad . cover up be good . 4 . Authority figure be often wrong . normal people be intelligent and should consider whether the instruction be really a good idea and alter or abolish bad government . they should think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate decision be often discourage from knowledge but should seek it anyway , and all the hard . for example , poor child without good school should work especially hard in order to make a well life for their child ( and themselves ) . I have tentatively name this new philosophy the Church of Eveism because Eve 's decision to eat the apple be mansickind 's first good decision , instead of its first bad one , as traditionally believe . she be therefore clearly a protagonist . God at first appear evil , for tell people not to seek knowledge but on deep analysis be also a protagonist . as God reward the decision to defy he , and provide the tree in the first place , the intention and desire be clearly to have the knowledge be obtain , but to delay it until it be actively seek . ---end serious discussion . begin humor.-- save this post to disk ( or file server ) . someday it will be consider the most important writing since the 10 Commandments . you want an original copy . stay tune for the RFD on soc.religion.eveism ... can I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization ? --return to serious discussion when post follow - ups.-- ';3

811;' this definitely have nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science- some of it be relevant in technology . there be little involvement of federal fund , or except through support of state university , of state fund , for scientific research before WWII . the US research position have be grow steadily , and the funding be mainly from university and private foundation fund . there be not that many research university , but they all provide their researcher with low teaching load , laboratory , assistant , and equipment , and fund for travel to scientific meeting . not that much , but it be provide , and a university wish to get a scholar have to consider research funding as well as salary . during WWII , the military and the defense department find that pure scientist could do quite well with their problem , even though they be not exactly in the area of the scientists ' expertise . this be probably because of the research mind approach , which be not to try to find a solution , but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerge . this work in stage , and as research scientist be use to discussion about their problem , the job get do . the military realize the importance of maintain scientist for the future , and start fund pure research after WWII . but Congress be unwilling to have military fund divert into this investment into the future supply of scientist , and set up other organization , such as NSF , to do the job . it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politic out . also , the government do a job on private foundation , make it more difficult for they to act to support research . the bad part of the federal involvement be that in those area in which the government support research the university will not provide funding , and in fact expect its scholar to bring in net government money . suppose , as have be the case , I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few month . what do you think happen if I ask for one ? the answer I will get be , get the money from NSF . now the money at the university level be a few thousand , but at the NSF level it come to about 20 thousand , and be likely to keep a faculty member from getting support . so the government be , in effect , decide which project get support , and how much . also , the government decide that the wealth should be spread . so instead of have a moderate number of university which be primarily research institution , the idea that more school should get into the act come into being . and instead of evaluate scholar , they have to go to evaluate reseach proposal . as a researcher , I can tell you that any research proposal have to be mainly wishful thinking , or as now happen , the investigator conceal already do work to release it as the result of the research . what I be propose today I may solve before the funding be grant , I may find impossible , or I may find that it be too difficult . in addition , tomorrow I may get unexpected research result . possibly I may bet a bright idea which solve yesterday 's too difficult problem , or a whole new approach to something I have not consider can develop . this be the nature of the beast , and except for really vague statement , if something can be predict , it be not major research , but development or routine activity not require more than minimal attention of a good researcher . I believe that at this time less quality research be be do than would have happen if the government have never get into it , and the government be try to divert researcher from thinker to plodder .

467;' the number of civilian iraqi death be way over - exaggerate and exploit for anti - war emotionalism by the liberal news medium . the fact be that less Iraqis die in the Gulf War than do civilian in any other war of comparable size this century ! this be due mostly to the short duration couple with precise surgical bombing technique which be technically possible only recently . the idea that hundred of thousand of iraqi citizen die be ludicrous . not even hundred of thousand of iraqi soldier die , and they be the one be target ! or do you think that the US and its ally be specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilian ? either the smart bomb didn't hit their target ( and we know they do ) , or they be target civilian target ( ! ) which be hardly condusive to destroy iraq 's military potential . the military mission planner be not fool , they know they have to hit  military  target to win a war . hit civilian target do nothing but unite the people against you , not a laudable goal if one want the people to rise up against their tyrant - dictator . how about all the innocent people who die in blanket - bombing in WW2 ? I don't hear you bemoan they ! War be never an exact science , but with smart bomb , it 's become more exact with a small percentage of civilian casualty . sometimes mistake be made- target be misidentified- innocent die . That 's war the way it really be . but the alternative , to allow tyrannical dictator to treat the earth like it 's one big rummage sale , grab everything they can get be bad . like Patrick Henry say some 217 year ago , I know not what course other may take -- but as for I , give I liberty , or give I death ! War be always the price one must be willing to pay if one wish to stay free . Mathew , your sarcasm be note but you be completely off - base here . you come off sound like a complete peace - nik idiot , although I feel sure that be not your intent . so the iraqi war be wrong , eh ? I'm sure that appeasement would have work well than war , just like it do in WW2 , eh ? I guess we shouldn't have fight WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent german civilian kill in Dresden and Hamburg . how about all the poor French who die in the crossfire because we invade the continent ? we should have just let Hitler take over Europe , and you'd be speak German instead of English right now . tyrant like Hussein  have  to be stop . his kind don't understand diplomacy- they only understand the point of a gun . my only regret be that Bush wimpe out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad , so now Hussein be still in power and the iraqi people 's sacrifice ( not to mention the 357 Americans who die ) be for naught . Liberating Kuwait be a good thing , but wipe Hussein off the map would've be well ! and as for poor , poor Rodney King ! do you ever stop and think  why  the jury in the first trial bring back a verdict of not guilty ? those who have be foam at the mouth for the blood of those policeman certainly have look no far than the video tape . but the jury look at  all  the evidence , evidence which you and I have not see . when one make a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be present on both side , one have simply lower himself to the level of vigilante justice , a state - of - mind which your sarcasm above seemingly speak against , but instead tend to support in the case against the policeman . Law in this country be intend to protect the right of the accuse , whether they be criminal or cop . one be not find guilty if there be a reasonable doubt of one 's guilt , and only the jury be in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict . anyone else be simply succumb to verbal vigilantism . regard , ';0

1883;' archive - name : atheism  introduction alt - atheism - archive - name : introduction last - modify : 5 April 1993 version : 1.2 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED message----- an introduction to atheism by mathew  mathewmantis.co.uk  this article attempt to provide a general introduction to atheism . whilst I have try to be as neutral as possible regard contentious issue , you should always remember that this document represent only one viewpoint . I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions- some relevant book be list in a companion article . to provide a sense of cohesion and progression , I have present this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist . all the question ask by the imaginary theist be question which have be crop up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup be create . some other frequently ask question be answer in a companion article . please note that this article be arguably slant towards answer question pose from a christian viewpoint . this be because the FAQ file reflect question which have actually be ask , and it be predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism . so when I talk of religion , I be talk primarily about religion such as Christianity , Judaism and Islam , which involve some sort of superhuman divine be . much of the discussion will apply to other religion , but some of it may not . what be atheism ? atheism be characterize by an absence of belief in the existence of God . some atheist go far , and believe that God do not exist . the former be often refer to as the weak atheist position , and the latter as strong atheism . it be important to note the difference between these two position . weak atheism be simple scepticism- disbelief in the existence of God . strong atheism be a positive belief that God do not exist . please do not fall into the trap of assume that all atheist be strong atheist . some atheist believe in the non - existence of all Gods- other limit their atheism to specific Gods , such as the Christian God , rather than make flat - out denial . but isn't disbelieve in God the same thing as believe he doesn't exist ? definitely not . Disbelief in a proposition mean that one do not believe it to be true . not believe that something be true be not equivalent to believe that it be false- one may simply have no idea whether it be true or not . which bring we to agnosticism . what be agnosticism then ? the term 'agnosticism ' be coin by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 . he define an agnostic as someone who disclaim ( strong ) atheism and believe that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable . thus an agnostic be someone who believe that we do not and can not know for sure whether God exist . word be slippery thing , and language be inexact . beware of assume that you can work out someone 's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnostic . for example , many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism , and use the word atheism only when refer to strong atheism . beware also that because the word atheist have so many shade of meaning , it be very difficult to generalize about atheist . about all you can say for sure be that atheist don't believe in God . for example , it certainly isn't the case that all atheist believe that science be the good way to find out about the universe . so what be the philosophical justification or basis for atheism ? there be many philosophical justification for atheism . to find out why a particular person choose to be an atheist , it 's good to ask she . many atheist feel that the idea of God as present by the major religion be essentially self - contradictory , and that it be logically impossible that such a God could exist . other be atheist through scepticism , because they see no evidence that God exist . but isn't it impossible to prove the non - existence of something ? there be many counter - example to such a statement . for example , it be quite simple to prove that there do not exist a prime number large than all other prime number . of course , this deal with well - define object obey well - define rule . whether Gods or universe be similarly well - define be a matter for debate . however , assume for the moment that the existence of a God be not provably impossible , there be still subtle reason for assume the non - existence of God . if we assume that something do not exist , it be always possible to show that this assumption be invalid by find a single counter - example . if on the other hand we assume that something do exist , and if the thing in question be not provably impossible , show that the assumption be invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a thing might be find , to show that it isn't there . such an exhaustive search be often impractical or impossible . there be no such problem with large prime , because we can prove that they don't exist . therefore it be generally accept that we must assume thing do not exist unless we have evidence that they do . even theist follow this rule most of the time- they don't believe in unicorn , even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorn exist anywhere . to assume that God exist be to make an assumption which probably can not be test . we can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere . so the sceptical atheist assume by default that God do not exist , since that be an assumption we can test . those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists- instead , they generally restrict their claim so as to cover variety of God describe by follower of various religion . so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exist , it may be possible to prove that ( say ) a God as describe by a particular religious book do not exist . it may even be possible to prove that no God describe by any present - day religion exist . in practice , believe that no God describe by any religion exist be very close to believe that no God exist . however , it be sufficiently different that counter - argument base on the impossibility of disprove every kind of God be not really applicable . but what if God be essentially non - detectable ? if God interact with our universe in any way , the effect of his interaction must be measurable . hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable . if God be essentially non - detectable , it must therefore be the case that he do not interact with our universe in any way . many atheist would argue that if God do not interact with our universe at all , it be of no importance whether he exist or not . if the Bible be to be believe , God be easily detectable by the Israelites . surely he should still be detectable today ? note that I be not demand that God interact in a scientifically verifiable , physical way . it must surely be possible to perceive some effect cause by his presence , though- otherwise , how can I distinguish he from all the other thing that don't exist ? ok , you may think there 's a philosophical justification for atheism , but isn't it still a religious belief ? one of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion be the redefinition game . the cynical view of this game be as follow : Person A begin by make a contentious statement . when person b point out that it can't be true , person a gradually re - define the word he use in the statement until he arrive at something person b be prepared to accept . he then record the statement , along with the fact that person b have agree to it , and continue . eventually a use the statement as an agree fact , but use his original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally need to get b to agree to it . rather than be see to be apparently inconsistent , B will tend to play along . the point of this digression be that the answer to the question isn't atheism a religious belief ? depend crucially upon what be mean by religious . Religion be generally characterize by belief in a superhuman control power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship .  It 's worth point out in pass that some variety of Buddhism be not religion accord to such a definition .  atheism be certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power , nor be it categorize by worship in any meaningful sense . widen the definition of religious to encompass atheism tend to result in many other aspect of human behaviour suddenly become class as religious as well -- such as science , politic , and watch tv . ok , so it be not a religion . but surely belief in atheism ( or science ) be still just an act of faith , like religion be ? firstly , it be not entirely clear that sceptical atheism be something one actually believe in . secondly , it be necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory datum we experience . Most atheist try to adopt as few core belief as possible- and even those be subject to question if experience throw they into doubt . Science have a number of core assumption . for example , it be generally assume that the law of physic be the same for all observer . these be the sort of core assumption atheist make . if such basic idea be call act of faith , then almost everything we know must be say to be base on act of faith , and the term lose its meaning . Faith be more often use to refer to complete , certain belief in something . accord to such a definition , atheism and science be certainly not act of faith . of course , individual atheist or scientist can be as dogmatic as religious follower when claim that something be certain . this be not a general tendency , however- there be many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exist . Faith be also use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof . sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition , as sceptical atheism have no belief . strong atheism be close , but still doesn't really match , as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental datum ( or the lack of it ) when assert that God do not exist . if atheism be not religious , surely it 's anti - religious ? it be an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against , friend or enemy . the truth be not so clear - cut . atheism be the position that run logically counter to theism- in that sense , it can be say to be anti - religion . however , when religious believer speak of atheist be anti - religious they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theist . this categorization of atheist as hostile towards religion be quite unfair . atheist attitude towards theist in fact cover a broad spectrum . Most atheist take a live and let live attitude . unless question , they will not usually mention their atheism , except perhaps to close friend . of course , this may be in part because atheism be not socially acceptable in many country . a few atheist be quite anti - religious , and may even try to convert other when possible . historically , such anti - religious atheist have make little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc country . ( to digress slightly : the Soviet Union be originally dedicate to separation of church and state , just like the USA . soviet citizen be legally free to worship as they wish . the institution of state atheism come about when Stalin take control of the Soviet Union and try to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the population . ) some atheist be quite vocal about their belief , but only where they see religion encroach on matter which be not its business -- for example , the government of the USA . such individual be usually concerned that church and state should remain separate . but if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state , surely that be the same as state atheism ? the principle of the separation of church and state be that the state shall not legislate concern matter of religious belief . in particular , it mean not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another , but also that it can not promote any belief which be religious in nature . religion can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matter . for example , religious believer have historically be responsible for encourage many political reform . even today , many organization campaign for an increase in spending on foreign aid be found as religious campaign . so long as they campaign concern secular matter , and so long as they do not discriminate on religious ground , most atheist be quite happy to see they have their say . what about prayer in school ? if there 's no God , why do you care if people pray ? because people who do pray be voter and lawmaker , and tend to do thing that those who don't pray can't just ignore . also , christian prayer in school be intimidate to non - Christians , even if they be tell that they need not join in . the diversity of religious and non - religious belief mean that it be impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event . also , non - prayer tend to have friend and family who pray . it be reasonable to care about friend and family waste their time , even without other motive . you mention Christians who campaign for increase foreign aid . what about atheist ? why aren't there any atheist charity or hospital ? Don't atheist object to the religious charity ? there be many charity without religious purpose that atheist can contribute to . some atheist contribute to religious charity as well , for the sake of the practical good they do . some atheist even do voluntary work for charity found on a theistic basis . Most atheist seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shout about in connection with charity . to they , atheism be just a simple , obvious everyday matter , and so be charity . many feel that it 's somewhat cheap , not to say self - righteous , to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious belief . to weak atheist , build a hospital to say I do not believe in God be a rather strange idea- it 's rather like hold a party to say today be not my birthday . why the fuss ? atheism be rarely evangelical . you say atheism isn't anti - religious . but be it perhaps a backlash against one 's upbringing , a way of rebel ? perhaps it be , for some . but many people have parent who do not attempt to force any religious ( or atheist ) idea upon they , and many of those people choose to call themselves atheist . It 's also doubtless the case that some religious people choose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing , as a way of be different . on the other hand , many people choose religion as a way of conform to the expectation of other . on the whole , we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion be backlash or conformism- although in general , people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently . how do atheist differ from religious people ? they don't believe in God . That be all there be to it . atheist may listen to heavy metal -- backwards , even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem , even if they know the word . they may wear hawaiian shirt , they may dress all in black , they may even wear orange robe . ( many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God . ) some atheist even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for argue against , of course ! whoever you be , the chance be you have meet several atheist without realise it . atheist be usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance . Unexceptional ? but aren't atheist less moral than religious people ? that depend . if you define morality as obedience to God , then of course atheist be less moral as they don't obey any God . but usually when one talk of morality , one talk of what be acceptable ( right ) and unacceptable ( wrong ) behaviour within society . human be social animal , and to be maximally successful they must co - operate with each other . this be a good enough reason to discourage most atheist from anti - social or immoral behaviour , purely for the purpose of self - preservation . many atheist behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other human . so why do they care what happen to other ? they don't know , they simply be that way . naturally , there be some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their action . however , there be equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious belief to justify their action . for example : here be a trustworthy saying that deserve full acceptance : Jesus Christ come into the world to save sinner ... but for that very reason , I be show mercy so that in I ... Jesus Christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in he and receive eternal life . now to the king eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . the above quote be from a statement make to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer , the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee , Wisconsin . it seem that for every atheist mass - murderer , there be a religious mass - murderer . but what of more trivial morality ? a survey conduct by the Roper Organization find that behavior deteriorate after bear again experience . while only 4 of respondent say they have drive intoxicate before be bear again , 12 have do so after conversion . similarly , 5 have use illegal drug before conversion , 9 after . two percent admit to engage in illicit sex before salvation- 5 after .  Freethought Today , September 1991 , p. 12 .  so it seem that at good , religion do not have a monopoly on moral behaviour . be there such a thing as atheist morality ? if you mean be there such a thing as morality for atheist ? , then the answer be yes , as explain above . many atheist have idea about morality which be at least as strong as those hold by religious people . if you mean do atheism have a characteristic moral code ? , then the answer be no . atheism by itself do not imply anything much about how a person will behave . Most atheist follow many of the same moral rule as theist , but for different reason . atheist view morality as something create by human , accord to the way human feel the world 'ought ' to work , rather than see it as a set of rule decree by a supernatural being . then aren't atheist just theist who be deny God ? a study by the Freedom from Religion Foundation find that over 90 of the atheist who respond become atheist because religion do not work for they . they have find that religious belief be fundamentally incompatible with what they observe around they . atheist be not unbeliever through ignorance or denial- they be unbeliever through choice . the vast majority of they have spend time study one or more religion , sometimes in very great depth . they have make a careful and consider decision to reject religious belief . this decision may , of course , be an inevitable consequence of that individual 's personality . for a naturally sceptical person , the choice of atheism be often the only one that make sense , and hence the only choice that person can honestly make . but don't atheist want to believe in God ? atheist live their life as though there be nobody watch over they . many of they have no desire to be watch over , no matter how good - natured the Big Brother figure might be . some atheist would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what ? should one believe thing merely because one want they to be true ? the risk of such an approach should be obvious . atheist often decide that want to believe something be not enough- there must be evidence for the belief . but of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of God -- they be unwilling in their soul to see ! many , if not most atheist be previously religious . as have be explain above , the vast majority have seriously consider the possibility that God exist . many atheist have spend time in prayer try to reach God . of course , it be true that some atheist lack an open mind- but assume that all atheist be biased and insincere be offensive and closed - minded . comment such as of course God be there , you just aren't look properly be likely to be view as patronize . certainly , if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it be vital that you give they the benefit of the doubt and assume that they be be sincere if they say that they have search for God . if you be not willing to believe that they be basically tell the truth , debate be futile . Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist ? many atheist live a purposeful life . they decide what they think give meaning to life , and they pursue those goal . they try to make their life count , not by wish for eternal life , but by have an influence on other people who will live on . for example , an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform , in the hope of leave his mark on history . it be a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random event . however , it be by no mean obvious that life be the sort of thing that have a meaning . to put it another way , not everything which look like a question be actually a sensible thing to ask . some atheist believe that ask what be the meaning of life ? be as silly as ask what be the meaning of a cup of coffee ? . they believe that life have no purpose or meaning , it just be . so how do atheist find comfort in time of danger ? there be many way of obtain comfort- from family , friend , or even pet . or on a less spiritual level , from food or drink or tv . that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger , but so what ? should individual believe in thing because they be comfort , or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be ? in the end , it 's a decision for the individual concern . Most atheist be unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make they feel comfortable . they put truth before comfort , and consider that if search for truth sometimes make they feel unhappy , that be just hard luck . don't atheist worry that they might suddenly be show to be wrong ? the short answer be no , do you ? many atheist have be atheist for year . they have encounter many argument and much suppose evidence for the existence of God , but they have find all of it to be invalid or inconclusive . thousand of year of religious belief haven't result in any good proof of the existence of God . atheist therefore tend to feel that they be unlikely to be prove wrong in the immediate future , and they stop worry about it . so why should theist question their belief ? don't the same argument apply ? no , because the belief be question be not similar . weak atheism be the sceptical default position to take- it assert nothing . strong atheism be a negative belief . Theism be a very strong positive belief . Atheists sometimes also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believer , but to everyone else . what sort of harm ? Religion represent a huge financial and work burden on mankind . It be not just a matter of religious believer waste their money on church buildings- think of all the time and effort spend building church , pray , and so on . imagine how that effort could be well spend . many theist believe in miracle healing . there have be plenty of instance of ill people be heal by a priest , cease to take the medicine prescribe to they by doctor , and die as a result . some theist have die because they have refuse blood transfusion on religious ground . it be arguable that the Catholic Church 's opposition to birth control -- and condom in particular -- be increase the problem of overpopulation in many third - world country and contribute to the spread of AIDS world - wide . religious believer have be know to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of a different religion . those weren't real believer . they just claim to be believer as some sort of excuse . what make a real believer ? there be so many one True Religions it 's hard to tell . look at christianity : there be many compete group , all convince that they be the only true Christians . sometimes they even fight and kill each other . how be an atheist suppose to decide who 's a real Christian and who isn't , when even the major christian church like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves ? in the end , most atheist take a pragmatic view , and decide that anyone who call himself a Christian , and use christian belief or dogma to justify his action , should be consider a Christian . maybe some of those Christians be just pervert Christian teaching for their own end -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily use to support un - christian act it can't be much of a moral code ? if the Bible be the word of God , why couldn't he have make it less easy to misinterpret ? and how do you know that your belief aren't a perversion of what your God intend ? if there be no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible , then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say - so ? sorry , but if someone claim that he believe in Jesus and that he murder other because Jesus and the Bible tell he to do so , we must call he a Christian . obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question . but since nobody have ever prove that God do not exist , it must be very unlikely that more basic religious belief , share by all faith , be nonsense . that do not hold , because as be point out at the start of this dialogue , positive assertion concern the existence of entity be inherently much hard to disprove than negative one . nobody have ever prove that unicorn don't exist , but that doesn't make it unlikely that they be myth . it be therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it be to hold a positive assertion by default . of course , weak atheist would argue that assert nothing be well still . well , if atheism be so great , why be there so many theist ? unfortunately , the popularity of a belief have little to do with how correct it be , or whether it works- consider how many people believe in astrology , graphology , and other pseudo - sciences . many atheist feel that it be simply a human weakness to want to believe in god . certainly in many primitive human society , religion allow the people to deal with phenomenon that they do not adequately understand . of course , there 's more to religion than that . in the industrialized world , we find people believe in religious explanation of phenomenon even when there be perfectly adequate natural explanation . Religion may have start as a means of attempt to explain the world , but nowadays it serve other purpose as well . but so many culture have develop religion . surely that must say something ? not really . Most religion be only superficially similar- for example , it 's worth remember that religion such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the christian sense . of course , most religion be quick to denounce compete religion , so it 's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another . what about all the famous scientist and philosopher who have conclude that God exist ? for every scientist or philosopher who believe in a god , there be one who do not . besides , as have already be point out , the truth of a belief be not determine by how many people believe it . also , it be important to realize that atheist do not view famous scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religious leader . a famous scientist be only human- she may be an expert in some field , but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight . many respected scientist have make themselves look foolish by speak on subject which lie outside their field of expertise . so be you really say that widespread belief in religion indicate nothing ? not entirely . it certainly indicate that the religion in question have property which have help it so spread so far . the theory of memetic talk of meme -- set of idea which can propagate themselves between human mind , by analogy with gene . some atheist view religion as set of particularly successful parasitic meme , which spread by encourage their host to convert other . some meme avoid destruction by discourage believer from question doctrine , or by use peer pressure to keep one - time believer from admit that they be mistaken . some religious meme even encourage their host to destroy host control by other meme . of course , in the memetic view there be no particular virtue associate with successful propagation of a meme . Religion be not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it , any more than a disease be a good thing because of the number of people who have catch it . even if religion be not entirely true , at least it put across important message . what be the fundamental message of atheism ? there be many important idea atheist promote . the follow be just a few of them- don't be surprised to see idea which be also present in some religion . there be more to moral behaviour than mindlessly follow rule . be especially sceptical of positive claim . if you want your life to have some sort of meaning , it be up to you to find it . search for what be true , even if it make you uncomfortable . make the most of your life , as it 's probably the only one you'll have . It 's no good rely on some external power to change you- you must change yourself . just because something 's popular doesn't mean it 's good . if you must assume something , assume something it 's easy to test . don't believe thing just because you want they to be true . and finally ( and most importantly ): all belief should be open to question . thank for take the time to read this article . mathew -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version : 2.2 iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXNVrOblFAQFSbwPMHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivXkHYYxMErFAO 7ltvtmvtu66nz6sbbpw9qkbjarby  S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R69bV9okE  q nihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP q0Z4hSSPpAU  q2V5 -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- ';0

737;' Hmm . the police strategy of burst in with weapon draw , clearly mark as officer and yell Police repeatedly . this be use every day to bust drug house . the idea be to awe the suspect into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight . as for not knock , it 's a sad necessity in many case since the suspect will attempt to escape or even fight . usually this strategy works- if it didn't , then it wouldn't be use so commonly , now would it ? whether or not it be appropriate to use this strategy on the BD be not my point , since I don't think any of we have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue . I merely point out that it be a valid strategy which be use every day . furthermore , we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehend potentially dangerous and armed suspect . do you suggest that the police always knock with gun holstere and never arrest any suspect until they have be allow to inspect the officers 's badge ? just what should the police do when apprehend potentially dangerous and armed suspect ? how far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves ? what do you suggest they can do which can't be fake by the competition ? even if you've get deadly enemy who may pretend to be cop , that be not an excuse to murder police . in the case of the bd 's , there be almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimie who would pretend to be cop . ';3
182;' of course not . I would think that would be great  fun  , not having ever feel the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze . this be not what I get when I believe - I just try to hide my fear of getting punish for something I never be sure of . the Bible be hopelessly confusing for someone who want to know for sure . God do not answer . in the end , I find I have be follow a mass delusion , a lie . I can't believe in a being who refuse to give a slight hint of her existence . I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reason why they believe and analyse their position . in fact , it be amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publication tell we exactly the opposite - one should not examine one 's belief critically . I'll tell you something I leave out of my 'testimony ' I post to this group two month ago . a day after I finally find out my faith be over , I decide to try just one more time . the same cycle of emotional response fire once again , but this time the delusion last only a couple of hour . I tell my friend in a phone that it really work , thank god , just to think about it again when I hang up . I have to admit that I have lie , and fall prey to the same illusion . I use to believe what I read in book when I be young , or what other people tell I , but I grow more and more skeptical the more I read . I learn what it mean to use  reason  . as a student of chemistry , I have to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compound in the lab . I  hate  experiment like this - they be old - fashioned and increase the student 's workload considerably . besides , I have to do it twice , since I fail in my first attempt . however , I think I'll never forget the lesson : no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown be X , it may still be Y. it be  very  tempting to jump into conclusion , take a leap of faith , assure oneself , ignore the datum which be inconsistent . but it can still be wrong . I find out that I be , after all , use exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self - assurance , suspension of fear , filtering of information . in other word , it be only I , no god play any part . oh ? and I have well believe this ? Dan , many UFO story be much well document than the resurrection of Jesus . the resurrection be document quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seem the author do not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out . besides , the end of the gospel probably contain late addition and insertions- for instance , the end of Mark ( 16:9 - 20 ) be miss from many early text , say my Bible . Jesus may have live and die , but he be probably misunderstood . this be easy . I believe that the world exist independent of my mind , and that logic and reason can be use to interpret and analyse what I observe . nothing else need to be take on faith , I will go by the evidence . it make no difference whether I believe George Washington exist or not . I assume that he do , consider the vast amount of evidence present . a liar , how do you know what my attitude be ? try read your Bible again . I be willing to die for my faith . those who do be usually remember as hero , at least among those who believe . Dan , do you think I'm lie when I say I believe firmly for 15 year ? it seem it be very difficult to admit that someone who have really believe do not do so anymore . but I can't go on lie to myself . blind trust be dangerous , and I be just another blind lead by the blind . but if god really want I , she'll know what to do . i'm willing . I just don't know whether she exists - look at the available evidence , it look like she doesn't . Petri ';0
898;' I suppose you don't know what about we have discuss . we discuss about error(s ) in XV 2.21 which show image only as 8bit , and my suggestion above work perfectly with it . so far I have see a colormap edit window in XV -- that be , there must be a colormap anyway . the problem you present be exist anyway , and I didn't try to solve they at all , because I would not make such problem to my program in the first place . Gamma and color correction be easily do to 24bit image as I present . There 's no need make trick from 8bit  quantize image back to 24 bit image . Ok , you're write about situation that user want edit image as 24bit and user want edit individual color -- your question , by the way , jump off the discussion a bit . my solution doesn't work , because there 's no colormap withe real 24bit image -- you see , user see 24bit image- go back to 8bit be silly . about change individual color in 8bit  quantize  rasterize image : change individual color in colormap be useless in most case if the image be quantize and rasterize -- small change may make serious error to anywhere in the image . XV allow this feature , but I don't recommend to use it with the mention type image . moreover , XV be not a paint program- you can only make those global change . in full 24bit XV , change individual color sound like paint program job . if person have 8bit screen , there 's need for trick to get the original 24bit image modify . because user don't see full 24bit image , there 's need to make approximation and it be not possible to modify individual color but individual pixel or pixel group ( if image be rasterize ) . to select indiavidual color , there could be 7x7 cursor window which show true color image in cursor window area -- select individual color be possible from that . ok , I don't have think very much 24bit painting program , never see such in good view and be not plan to make such . not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen ... it save 8bit  quantize  rasterize image as 24bit jpegs- jpeg be not design for that . also , human expect that 24bit will be save as 24bit image- say , person would like to crop part of the image and save it , then it be expect that the image still be the same . so , XV be design without think about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error . I have hear XV be design first for 8bit image  file , but it be not good idea to take full 24bit image without make major change to the original design . so , even all screen image be 8bit , the process image and save image could have be 24bit very easily , instead of 8bit . before anybody will make a note : yes , I may as well make a lift where 'up ' mean that the lift go down and 'down ' mean that the lift go up , and put a note on this design solution to the manual -- however , even the manual tell the correct situation , it doesn't solve the problem . ( american : the lift be just an example :) well , my text may be a bit hard reading , hopefully you suggeede to read it . ';1

I be also shock when I first realize that you have to offset line from fill by about 16 bit ( assume 24 bit z buffer ) . this seem huge , but be only 1256 of the dynamic range . in those term it doesn't seem so bad . what be happen be that the interpolation in z be not totally linear , due mainly to roundoff , I believe . so the polygon be not planar in z , but be more like a Ruffles potato chip . ditto with line . when you start  end at different x  y value , the ridge be out of phase , result in the stitch effect . you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another , but with different vertex . you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap . example : try Polygon 1 : ( 100,100,100 ) ( 100,200,100 ) ( 200,200,100 ) ( 200,100,100 ) Polygon 2 : ( 125,125,100 ) ( 125,175,100 ) ( 175,175,100 ) ( 175,125,100 ) your implementation be correct . in fact , we do a similar trick when render primitive that have line and polygon - such as NURBS surface with isoparametric line . without the trick , the line appear stitch , as you say . when the application draw line  polygon independently , the system do not have the smart to automatically do the z shift , so the application must do it . this be what you have discover and be do .

I do they never hear of it but suggest that , like our president do , that any percentage number like this be include in the overhead . no Allen you do not . you merely repeat allegation make by an employee of the overhead capital of NASA . nothing that Reston do could not be do not well or cheap at the other NASA center where the work be go on . Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talk about a problem like this be at a place where everything be overhead . why do the Space News artice point out that it be the congressionally demand change that cause the problem ? methink that you be be selective with the fact again . if it take four flight a year to resupply the station and you have a cost of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year . you state that your friend at Reston say that with the current station they could resupply it for a billion a year if the wrap be go . this merely point out a blatent contridiction in your number that understandably you fail to see .

1825;'  I hope I give you a fairly solid answer to this one : I simply don't agree  with the embodied version of a Satan who be a separate creation or a force .  and there be quite physical description of Heaven and Hell in the  Holy Qur'an , the Bible , etc . there have be time in the spiritual  and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical  description of Heaven , Hell , and Satan be take quite literally  and that  work  for the time . as I mention in the tradition  cite above , for example , it be sufficient in the absence of a theory  about germ and disease spread by worm to simply describe the evil  which be pass to a consumer of spoiled food as satanic . which beg the question : if Satan in this case be metaphorical , how can you be certain Allah be not the same way ?  the bottom line here , however , be that describe a spiritual plane  in human language be something like describe color to a person  who have be blind from birth . you may want to read the book  FLATLAND ( if you haven't already ) or the dragon 's EGG . the first  be intend as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-  cept ...  some delete for space saving   when language fail because it can not be use to adequately describe  another dimension which can not be experience by the speaker , then  such convention as metaphor , allegory , and the like come to be  necessary . the unseen be describe in term which have reference   and mean for the reader  listener . but , like all model , a compro-  mise must be make when speak metaphorically : clarity and directness  of meaning , equivalence of perception , and the like be all  cripple . but what else can you do ? this be why I ask the above . how would you then know God exist as a spirit or be rather than just be metaphorical ? I mean , it 's okay to say well , Satan be just metaphorical , but then you have to justify this belief and justify that God be not some metaphor for something else . I say this because there be many , many instance of Satan describe as a being ( such as the tormentor in the Old Testament book of Job , or the temptor in the New Testament Gospels ) . in the same way , God too be describe as a being ( or spirit . ) how be I to know one be metaphorical and not the other . far , belief in God isn't a bar to evil . Let 's consider the case of satanist : even if Satan be metaphorical , the Satanist would have to believe in God to justify this belief . again , we have a case where someone do believe in God , but by religious standard , they be evil . if Bobby do see this , let he address this question also .  delete some more on metaphor  Stephen          atheist                libertarian            pro - individuality            pro - responsibility           Jr.  and all that jazz ...

Dean again : you make an ass of yourself by say that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah be somehow an attempt to paint Jews as plaster saint , thereby reveal your inability to understand the discussion as well as show your dislike for people say positive thing about Jews , and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignore the simple argument be make , and then claim I be ignore the very argument I acknowledge . actually , what happen be that Dean make it seem like any Jew who give alm or do other act of charity in public be a hypocrite accord to jewish custom . in do so , he be caricature jewish custom as be almost impossibly demand , as well as implicitly slander all Jews who make public their act of charity . I go very easily on Dean for this , give he the benefit of the doubt in a post follow my initial crack about plaster saint , suggest that he have be merely careless in his wording . in an astonishing act of ingratitude , Dean now serve up an incredibly distort picture of what take place between we , and use it as the basis of one insult after another .

92;' well , here go . the first item of business be to establish the importance space life science in the whole of scheme of humankind . I mean compare to football and baseball , the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight . I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education . all of we , in our own way , can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be release to the general public around the world . the document would scientifically analyze the technical aspect of long term human habitation in space . I believe that if any long - term space exploration program be to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld ( i.e. the spacecraft ) . only through the careful analysis of engineering , chemical , biological , and medical factor will a good ecosystem be create to facilitate human life on a long - duration flight . so , I would like to see post of opinion regard the most objective method to analyze the accept scientific literature for technology which can be apply to long - duration spaceflight . such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocate and clearly important to exist space program . in essence , we would be divide the space life science issue into various technical problem which could be solve with various technology . this database of acceptable solution to various problem could form the basis of detailed discussion involve people from the bionet , isunet , and any other source !

Rob , I be not intimate with jewish theology , but I understand that you be a Messianic Jew . correct I if I be wrong , but it appear that the view of Messianic Jews on metaphysics be different to that of the majority of Jews . while jewish theology overall be quite distinct from the christianic god view , I have hear that it be possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god , an no - no for Christians , the Bible be still see as effect of the interaction of some god with man .

( big deletion ) no , not the interpretation of some law , but the interpretation of the bible . as in the example that Sodom and Gomorrha mean argue with god . the whole idea that it be metaphorically and yet allow you to argue with a god ( whatever that mean , that alone be a theo- logic question ) be proof of a theology use . it be an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha mean . either there be some connection between the text , the fact that it exist , and your interpretation of it , or it be purely arbitrary .. far , the question be why be have one to carry the burden of biblical text when one could simply write other book that convey the message well . you might answer that one can't becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lose , but that hold true of every other book , and the question remain why have the Bible still a special place ? can't it be replace somehow ? be it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other message that be include as well ? ( deletion ) Sorry , but there be bad system do not say anything about if one could not have a well system . ( deletion ) if we read two story in the Bible , one that god command people to kill child for be idolater and another where god kill child directly , what be more important to resolve , the message that child be to be kill or if it have to be do by god ? and the argument you have give be a fallacy , while it may not be important in the context you have give to find out if god be corporeal or not , it can be crucial in other question . religious believer resolve contradiction with that they choose one of the possibility give in an arbitrary way , and have the advantage of be able to attribute their decision to some god .

I be content to live my own life , and fend for myself , so when I die , I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up , it will be because of  my  action and  my  choice . if your god decide to toss I into a flame pit for this , then so be it . I would much rather just cease to exist . but if your god want my respect and my obedience , then it have well earn these- and if it do , then they will be very strong and true . Jesus wasn't the only one who rise from the dead -- I think it be Osiris who do the same , as well as a few character from Greek or Norse legend , if memory serve . but still : why would I want to rise from the dead ? why do  you  want to ? if your god want to win my devotion , then it know what it can do -- provide some way for I to believe without have to resort to blind faith that could be apply equally well to any religion . That 's precisely it . I neither see nor know Zeus either , nor Odin . shall I offer they the same devotion I offer Jesus ? You've get to understand my point - of - view : I see Christians spout Bible verse all the time as if it be some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition . truth be , it 's not . Robert have never demonstrate that he actually understand what the verse imply- he just rattle they off day by day . some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality , and I point these out where I can . but even more than that , even when Christians  do  try to explain the verse in their own word , they do so from a christian point of view , which be that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understand the christian message properly , and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end . Here be the problem with that : substitute Moslem or Buddhist or Satanist instead of Christian , and it mean the same thing . christanity be a very nice belief set around a very nice book . but if you want to make I believe that it have any bearing on the REAL world , you've get some convincing to do . and in my opinion , you're bumble about blindly make up entity where there aren't any , and deprive yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life . as long as you keep your belief to yourself , I'll keep my belief to myself -- but as soon as you start wave they around , expect I to toss in my opinion , too .

249;'  recently , I've ask myself a rather interesting question : what right do  god have on our life ( always assume there be a god , of course ... ! ) ? ?   in his infinite wisdom , he make it perfectly clear that if we don't live  accord to his rule , we will burn in hell . well , with what right can god  make that desicion ? Let 's say , for the sake of argument , that god create  every one of we ( directly or indirectly , it doesn't matter . ) . what then  happen , be that he first create we , and then turn we lose . well , I didn't  ask to be create .   Let 's make an analogue . if a scientist create a unique living creature  ( which have happen , it be even patent ... ! ! ! ) , do he then have the  right to expect it to behave in a certain matter , or die ... ? Dear Joakim , let I begin by say that these be excellent question , but that by ask , you will find as many different explanation as there be respondent . as a latter - day Saint , I believe that all of we ( you , I , etc . ) live once as spirit - child of God the Father ( Hebrews 12:9 ) in the pre - mortal existance . in order to continue our eternal progression , an earthly probationary time be require . ( to live by faith , not by sight , to choose good over evil , and to prepare ourselves in all thing to become worthy of a high order of existance . ) we believe that all of God 's spirit - offspring be once assemble to discuss the specific of this earthly sojourn . one - third chose for Lucifer 's plan , most follow the Firstborn ( the pre - mortal Jesus Christ ) . Lucifer 's aspiration ( I will exalt my throne above the star of God . . . Isaiah 14:12 - 17 , etc . ) result into the rebellion of his follower against the Firstborn and those who follow he , result in the casting out of Lucifer ( who become Satan , the father of lie ) and one - third of the host of heaven ( and his tail draw the third part of the star of heaven , and do cast they to the earth . . . Revelation 12:4 ) as demon ( evil spirit ) . to get back on our choice to be bear on this earth , and to be subject to God and his plan ( for good or bad , base upon our obedience and choice ) , we make that choice individually . ( God speak to Job : where wast thou when I lay the foundation of the earth , . . . when the morning star sing together , and all the son of God shout for joy ? Job 38:4 - 7 ) . we lose the knowledge of our pre - mortal existance ( the Veil of Forgetful- ness , somewhere in Psalms ) , in order to live by faith , not by sight . you may not accept this scenario , neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone , which offer only fragmentary insight into this particular aspect of our existence as individual , as son and daughter of God .  who be god to impose its rule on we ? who can tell if god be REALLY so  righteous as god like we to believe ? be all christian a flock of sheep ,  unable to do otherwise that follow the rest ?   Hmmmmmmmmmmmm . ( all Christians , by definition , be a flock of sheep , follow the Shepherd as they understand he -- ) --but in any event , not all Christians believe in the same theology , such as the one latter - day saint believe in . ( they will cry heresy and other accusation of pervert the doctrine of the Bible , while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretation , as find in their catechism and various do - it - yourself Bible - study manual ... ) as for I , I have a personal conviction that the pre - existance scenario as explain above , be most in harmony with biblical doctrine , some Dead Sea Scroll book , the pseudographion , other ( jewish ) source , and last but not least , modern - day revelation on the subject .  I just want to point out that this be not sarcasm , I mean it .   how should one deal with a man who be convince that  he be act accord to God 's will , and who there-  Jokke fore believe that he be do you a favour by  stab you in the back ?   -voltaire ';3

60;' John E. King ( kingctron.com ) post a whopping one liner :  the modern theory of evolution be so inadequate that it deserve to be   treat as a matter of faith . -- Francis Hitching  I have a few point to make about the above posting . 1 . science be not base on and do not consist of quote from either real or alleged expert . critical reasoning , evidence and ( if possible ) experimentation be necessary . creationist frequently display a massive confusion about this by merely quote both non - expert and expert alike ( some of the latter quote be in fact false ) and steadfastly refuse to follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure . this strongly suggest that ( a. ) their claim completely lack any scientific merit and ( b. ) they be aware of this fatal deficiency . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 2 . you have fail to identify Hitching and the surround context of his statement . why be that ? if Hitching be a scientific illiterate then the quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology . creationist be frequently know to quote real scientist out of context and to fabricate statement that they subsequently attribute to legitimate scientist . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 3 . evidence support the allege inadequacy of the modern theory of evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one line quote from an unidentified nobody . it be also important to note that disprove biological evolution do not automatically prove some alternate claim any more that disprove that the earth be shape like a hockey puck prove that it be a hyperbolic paraboloid . creationist seem rather fond of diving ( head first ) into this logical fallacy . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 4 . since evolution be central to virtually all of modern science , an attack on evolution ( either the fact or the theory ) really represent an attack on science . while the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve ( B ) the fact of evolution will not ever go away . creationist lose the battle long ago ( more than 100 year in fact ) but be simply too willfully ignorant and irrational to acknowledge the fact . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and you may not really be that ignorant . Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub ( kv07IASTATE.EDU ) ask :  neither I , nor Webster 's have ever hear of Francis Hitchings . who be he ?  I , like hitching , be not to be find in Webster 's B ) . Francis Hitchings be a scientifically illiterate creationist ( or perhaps he be just play the part of one ) who write a quite ignorant book attack evolution ( the Neck of the Giraffe ) . in that publication he quote a creationist ( Jean Sloat Morton ) use the standard invalid creationist probability argument that protein could not have form by chance . thus not only confuse abiogenesis with evolution ( the two be quite independent ) but also conclude with a non sequitur ( i.e. the conclusion do not follow ) .  pp 70 - 71  hitching also misquote Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism .  pp 84  hitching book be review by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times ( and repeat in the Oregonian ) . the article be title  Giraffe ' stick scientific neck out too far . excerpt include : Francis Hitchings be not a biologist . he go after Darwin like Mark Antony after Brutus . he flip from scientific reasoning to mysticism and pseudo - science with the sinuosity of a snake - oil salesman . he suggest a mystical  organizing principle ' of life , use the similarity of organ in different creature as evidence  sic  . note that the last statement above be actually evidence for evolution not against it . if John E. King be quote from this review book it wouldn't surprise I much . It 's also interesting that King have nothing to add ( i.e. he only post a quote ) . ';0

' suppose that you say in the assembly of a ruler , while be observe by he , 'the true ruler have appoint I to such and such position . 'At a time when you be ask to prove your claim , the word 'Yes ' utter by the ruler would sufficiently support you . or , if the ruler change his usual practice and attitude at your request , this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'Yes. ' in the same way , ALLAH 's Most Noble Messenger claim : 'i be the envoy of the creator of this universe . my proof be that he will change his unbroken order at my request and my prayer . now look at my finger : he make they run like a fountain with five spigot . look at the moon : by a gesture of my finger , he split it in two . look at that tree : to affirm I , and to bear witness to I , it move and come near to I . look at this food : although it be barely enough for two or three man , it satisfy two or three hundred .

' although many of the researcher have conclude that the proof of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracle number about one thousand , there be thousand , perhaps hundred of thousand of proof of his prophethood . and hundred of thousand of truth - seek man ( muhakkikiin ) with varying opinion have affirm his prophethood in an equal number of way . the Wise our'an alone demonstrate thousand of the proof of his prophethood , in addition to its own forty aspect of miraculousness . since prophethood be as a phenomenon of humanity , and hundred of thousand of individual who claim prophethood and perform miracle have live and pass away- then , the prophethood of Muhammad ( SAW ) be of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the other . for whatever evidence , quality and attribute become the mean of the prophethood and messengership of all the messenger such as Jesus ( AS ) and Moses ( AS ) , they be all own in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad ( SAW ) . and since the cause and mean of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad ( SAW ) , this authority be to be find in he with more certanity than all the other prophet .

You're right , the bottom line be truth , independant from you or anyone else . since you proclaim truth as a self - proclaim appointee , may I ask you by what authority you do this ? because it say so in the Bible ? --doe the Bible say so , or be it you , or someone else , who interpret whether a scripture or doctrine conform to your particular liking or disapproval ? Excuse moi , but your line of truth haven't move I one bit to persuade I that my belief be erroneous . of all the preacher of truth on this net , you have strike I as a self - righteous member of the wreck crew , with no positive message to I or other latter - day saint whatsoever .

Sophistry . look who 's talking : jump to conclusion ? you wouldn't do that yourself , right ? all you address be your own conviction , regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of view , because you reject such interpretation without any consideration whatsoever .   the Bible state that Lucifer be create . the Bible state that Jesus  be the creator of all . the contradiction that we have be that the LDS  belief be that Jesus and Lucifer be the same . a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine . the former KGB would have love to employ you .

Satan and his follower have rebel against God , and be not child ( follower  redeem ) of God , but it doesn't mean that they be not once create by God , but choose to separate themselves from those who choose to follow God and his plan of salvation .   the field be the world- the good seed be the child of the  kingdom- but the tare be the child of the wicked one-  ( Matthew 13:38 ) kingdom be those who have remain valiant in their testimony of Jesus ( and have show work of repentance , etc . ) , and the child of the wicked one be those who rebel against God and the lamb . the issue of satan 's spirit - offspring ( and those who follow he ) have not be address in this and other verse you copy from your Bible . you purposefully obscure the subject by swamp your right with non- relate scripture .

I rather look to official ( doctrinal ) source , and ... to Hugh Nibley 's book ! ( the last comment be an lds - insider reference . ) Summarizing : McConkie be a wise man who contribute undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have , but whose view be by no means dogma or accept doctrine , some of it clearly belong to personal interpretation and speculation . but having say this , I find McConkie ( even in his most biased and speculative moment ) far more thought - provoking than the trash come from your proverbial pen .

Version 1.21 be mainly a bugfix for THINK c user . this VERSION now runs with THINK C , I promise ! the Docs now contain a chapter for c programmer on how to use the GrafSys . if you have problem , feel free to contact I . the other change be that I remove the FastPerfTrig call from the FPU version to make it run fast . those of you who don't know what all this be about , read on .         Programmers 3d GrafSys -- what it be : ------------------------------------- Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you need some way of draw three - dimensional scene ? Didn't you always want to write this program that visualize the structure of three - dimensional molecule ? and didn't the task of write your 3d conversion routine keep you from actually do it ? well if the answer to any of the above question be 'Yes , but what have it to do with this package??? ' , read on . GrafSys be a THINK Pascal  C library that provide you with simple routine for building , saving , loading ( as resource ) , and manipulate ( independent rotate around arbitrary achse , translate and scaling ) three dimensional object . object , not just simple single - line drawing . GrafSys support full 3d clipping , animation and some ( primitive ) hidden- line  hide - surface drawing with simple command from within your PROGRAM . GrafSys also support full eye control with both perspective and parallel projection ( if you can't understand a word , don't worry , this be just show off for those who know about it . the doc that come with it will try to explain what it all mean later on ) . GrafSys provide a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routine with datum so you can use GrafSys to do the 3d transformation and your own routine to do the actual drawing . ( note that GrafSys also provide draw routine so you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to ) GrafSys 1.11 come in two version . one for the 881 and 020 or above processor . the other version use fix - point arithmetic and run on any Mac . both version be  100 source compatibel  . GrafSys come with an extensive manual that teach you the fundamental of 3d graphic and how to use the package . if demand be big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object - class library . however , I feelt that the way it be implement now make it easy to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP - Guild ' . GrafSys be free for any non - commercial usage . read the documentation enclose . ';1

Lockheed develop this for the Air Force . - A Power Station Capability be obtain in 3 Shuttle Flights . SSF Solar array be use to provide 20 kW of power . the vehicle fly in an arrow mode to optimize the microgravity environment . Shuttle  Spacelab mission would utilize the vehilce as a power source for 30 day mission . - Human tend capability ( as oppose to the old SSF sexist term of man - tend capability ) be achieve by the addition of the US common module . this be a modify version of the exist SSF Lab module ( dock port be add for the International Partners ' lab , take the place of the node on SSF ) . the Shuttle can be dock to the station for 60 day mission . the Orbiter would provide crew habitability  EVA capability . - International Human Tended . add the NASDA  ESA module , and add another 20 kW of power - Permanent Human Presence Capability . add a 3rd power module , the U.S. habitation module , and an ACRV ( Assured Crew Return Vehicle ) . Option B - Space Station Freedom derive the option B team be base at LaRC , and be lead by Mike Griffin . this option look alot like the exist SSF design , which we have all come to know and love :) this option assume a lightweight external tank be available for use on all SSF assembly flight ( so do option a ) . also , the number of flight be compute for a 51.6 inclination orbit , for both option A and B. the build - up occur in six phase : - Initial Research Capability reach after 3 flight . power be transfer from the vehicle to the Orbiter  Spacelab , when it visit . - Man - Tended Capability ( Griffin have not yet adopt non - sexist language ) be achieve after 8 flight . the U.S. Lab be deploy , and 1 solar power module provide 20 kW of power . - Permanent Human Presence Capability occur after 10 flight , by keep one Orbiter on - orbit to use as an acrv ( so sometimes there would be two orbiter on - orbit - the acrv , and the second one that come up for Logistics  re - supply ) . - a two Fault tolerance capability be achieve after 14 flight , with the addition of a 2nd power module , another thermal control system radiator , and more propulsion module . - after 20 flight , the Internationals be on - board .

1085;' why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cut . for example , why couldn't Magellan just be tell to go into a safe mode and stay bob about Venus in a low - power - use mode and if maybe in a few year if funding get restore after the economy get well ( hopefully ) , it could be turn on again . for that matter , why exactly be the Apollo lunar experiment turn off rather than just safe . be it political ( i.e. as along as they could be use , someone would keep bug congress for fund ) ? turn they off keep they pesky scientist out of the bureaucrat 's hair .... I've hear the argument that an active but uncontrolled spacecraft cause radio noise . I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly design safe mode . this safe mode could be a program routine which cause the spacecraft to go to least fuel use orientation , and once a ( week , month , year , whatever ) attempt a signal lock on Earth . at that time , if funding have be restore , the mission can continue . if no signal be recieve , the spacecraft go back to the safe mode for another time period . as we would know when the spacecraft be go to try to contact Earth , we could be prepare if necessary . as another a spacecraft could do at the attempt contact be beam store datum towards Earth . if someone can receive it , great , if not , so it 's lost and no big deal . by make the time and signal location generally know , perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the datum even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft . I see this as be particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and be in or be go to place which be otherwise unaccessible ( Jupiter  Saturn Orbit , exit the solar system , etc ) . perhaps those design future spacecraft ( Cassini , Pluto Flyby , etc ) should consider design in a pause mode in case their spacecraft get the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission . perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine write in for the post mission drift phase . so any hole in all this ?

MARINER 3 , launch on November 5 , 1964 , be lose when its protective shroud fail to eject as the craft be place into interplanetary space . unable to collect the Sun 's energy for power from its solar panel , the probe soon die when its battery run out and be now in solar orbit . it be intend for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4 . MARINER 4 , the sister probe to MARINER 3 , do reach Mars in 1965 and take the first close - up image of the martian surface ( 22 in all ) as it fly by the planet . the probe find a cratered world with an atmosphere much thin than previously think . many scientist conclude from this preliminary scan that Mars be a dead world in both the geological and biological sense . MARINER 5 be send to Venus in 1967 . it reconfirm the datum on that planet collect five year early by MARINER 2 , plus the information that Venus ' atmospheric pressure at its surface be at least 90 time that of Earth 's , or the equivalent of be 3,300 foot under the surface of an ocean . MARINER 6 and 7 be send to Mars in 1969 and expand upon the work do by MARINER 4 four year early . however , they fail to take away the concept of Mars as a dead planet , first make from the basic measurement of MARINER 4 . MARINER 8 end up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot fail . MARINER 9 , the sister probe to MARINER 8 , become the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971 . it return information on the Red Planet that no other probe have do before , reveal huge volcano on the martian surface , as well as giant canyon system , and evidence that water once flow across the planet . the probe also take the first detailed closeup image of Mars ' two small moon , Phobos and Deimos . MARINER 10 use Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974 . the probe do return the first close - up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet , reveal previously unseen detail in the cloud cover , plus the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in four Earth day . MARINER 10 eventually make three flyby of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before run out of attitude control gas . the probe reveal Mercury as a heavily cratere world with a mass much great than think . this would seem to indicate that Mercury have an iron core which make up 75 percent of the entire planet . PIONEER ( MOON , SUN , VENUS , JUPITER , and SATURN FLYBYS and orbiter ) PIONEER 1 through 3 fail to meet their main objective - to photograph the Moon close - up - but they do reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth and the Moon , include new datum on the Van Allen radiation belt circle Earth . all three craft have failure with their rocket launcher . PIONEER 1 be launch on October 11 , 1958 , PIONEER 2 on November 8 , and PIONEER 3 on December 6 . PIONEER 4 be a Moon probe which miss the Moon and become the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959 . PIONEER 5 be originally design to flyby Venus , but the mission be scale down and it instead study the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to 36.2 million kilometer in 1960 , a record until MARINER 2 . PIONEER 6 through 9 be place into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 : PIONEER 6 , 7 , and 8 be still transmit information at this time . PIONEER E ( would have be number 10 ) suffer a launch failure in 1969 . PIONEER 10 become the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973 . PIONEER 11 follow it in 1974 , and then go on to become the first probe to study Saturn in 1979 . both vehicle should continue to function through 1995 and be head off into interstellar space , the first craft ever to do so . PIONEER Venus 1 ( 1978 ) ( also know as PIONEER Venus Orbiter , or PIONEER 12 ) burn up in the venusian atmosphere on October 8 , 1992 . PVO make the first radar study of the planet 's surface via probe . PIONEER Venus 2 ( also know as PIONEER 13 ) send four small probe into the atmosphere in December of 1978 . the main spacecraft bus burn up high in the atmosphere , while the four probe descend by parachute towards the surface . though none be expect to survive to the surface , the Day probe do make it and transmit for 67.5 minute on the ground before its battery fail . RANGER ( LUNAR LANDER and IMPACT MISSIONS ) RANGER 1 and 2 be test probe for the ranger lunar impact series . they be mean for high Earth orbit testing in 1961 , but rocket problem leave they in useless low orbit which quickly decay . RANGER 3 , launch on January 26 , 1962 , be intend to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon , but problem during the launch cause the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit . ranger 3 do try to take some image of the Moon as it fly by , but the camera be unfortunately aim at deep space during the attempt . RANGER 4 , launch April 23 , 1962 , have the same purpose as RANGER 3 , but suffer technical problem enroute and crash on the lunar farside , the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon , albeit without return datum . RANGER 5 , launch October 18 , 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4 , lose all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually miss the Moon and drift off into solar orbit . ranger 6 through 9 have more modify lunar mission : they be to send back live image of the lunar surface as they head towards an impact with the Moon . ranger 6 fail this objective in 1964 when its camera do not operate . ranger 7 through 9 perform well , become the first U.S. lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through 1965 . LUNAR ORBITER ( LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY ) LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 be design to orbit the Moon and image various site be study as land area for the manned APOLLO mission of 1969 - 1972 . the probe also contribute greatly to our understanding of lunar surface feature , particularly the lunar farside . all five probe of the series , launch from 1966 to 1967 , be essentially successful in their mission . they be the first U.S. probe to orbit the Moon . all lo be eventually crash into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO mission . SURVEYOR ( lunar soft LANDERS ) the SURVEYOR series be design primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sink into the soil ( before this time , it be fear by some that the Moon be cover in great layer of dust , which would not support a heavy landing vehicle ) . SURVEYOR be successful in prove that the lunar surface be strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968 . only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 be unsuccessful mission . the rest become the first U.S. probe to soft land on the Moon , take thousand of image and scoop the soil for analysis . APOLLO 12 land 600 foot from SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and return part of the craft to Earth . SURVEYOR 7 , the last of the series , be a purely scientific mission which explore the Tycho crater region in 1968 . VIKING ( MARS orbiter and LANDERS ) vike 1 be launch from Cape Canaveral , Florida on August 20 , 1975 on a titan 3e - CENTAUR d1 rocket . the probe go into martian orbit on June 19 , 1976 , and the lander set down on the western slope of Chryse Planitia on July 20 , 1976 . it soon begin its program search for Martian micro - organism ( there be still debate as to whether the probe find life there or not ) , and send back incredible color panorama of its surrounding . one thing scientist learn be that Mars ' sky be pinkish in color , not dark blue as they originally think ( the sky be pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust particle in the thin atmosphere ) . the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulder stretch out as far as its camera could image . the VIKING 1 orbiter keep function until August 7 , 1980 , when it run out of attitude - control propellant . the lander be switch into a weather - report mode , where it have be hope it would keep function through 1994- but after November 13 , 1982 , an errant command have be send to the lander accidentally tell it to shut down until further order . communication be never regain again , despite the engineers ' effort through May of 1983 . an interesting side note : vike 1 's lander have be designate the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team . the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. be entrust with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until it can be attach to the lander by a manned expedition . vike 2 be launch on September 9 , 1975 , and arrive in martian orbit on August 7 , 1976 . the lander touch down on September 3 , 1976 in Utopia Planitia . it accomplish essentially the same task as its sister lander , with the exception that its seisometer work , record one marsquake . the orbiter have a series of attitude - control gas leak in 1978 , which prompt it be shut down that July . the lander be shut down on April 12 , 1980 . the orbit of both viking orbiter should decay around 2025 . VOYAGER ( outer PLANET FLYBYS ) VOYAGER 1 be launch September 5 , 1977 , and fly past Jupiter on March 5 , 1979 and by Saturn on November 13 , 1980 . VOYAGER 2 be launch August 20 , 1977 ( before VOYAGER 1 ) , and fly by Jupiter on August 7 , 1979 , by Saturn on August 26 , 1981 , by Uranus on January 24 , 1986 , and by Neptune on August 8 , 1989 . VOYAGER 2 take advantage of a rare once - every-189 - year alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet . VOYAGER 1 could , in principle , have head towards Pluto , but JPL opt for the sure thing of a Titan close up . between the two probe , our knowledge of the 4 giant planet , their satellite , and their ring have become immense . VOYAGER 12 discover that Jupiter have complicate atmospheric dynamic , lightning and aurorae . three new satellite be discover . two of the major surprise be that Jupiter have ring and that Io have active sulfurous volcano , with major effect on the Jovian magnetosphere . when the two probe reach Saturn , they discover over 1000 ringlet and 7 satellite , include the predict shepherd satellite that keep the ring stable . the weather be tame compare with Jupiter : massive jet stream with minimal variance ( a 33 - year great white spot  band cycle be know ) . Titan 's atmosphere be smoggy . Mimas ' appearance be startling : one massive impact crater give it the Death Star appearance . the big surprise here be the stranger aspect of the ring . braid , kink , and spoke be both unexpected and difficult to explain . VOYAGER 2 , thank to heroic engineering and programming effort , continue the mission to Uranus and Neptune . Uranus itself be highly monochromatic in appearance . one oddity be that its magnetic axis be find to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis , give Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere . icy channel be find on Ariel , and Miranda be a bizarre patchwork of different terrain . 10 satellite and one more ring be discover . in contrast to Uranus , Neptune be find to have rather active weather , include numerous cloud feature . the ring arc turn out to be bright patch on one ring . two other ring , and 6 other satellite , be discover . Neptune 's magnetic axis be also skew . Triton have a canteloupe appearance and geyser . ( What 's liquid at 38 K ? ) the two voyager be expect to last for about two more decade . their on - target journeying give negative evidence about possible planet beyond Pluto . their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause . SOVIET planetary mission since there have be so many soviet probe to the Moon , Venus , and Mars , I will highlight only the primary mission : SOVIET lunar probes LUNA 1 - lunar impact attempt in 1959 , miss Moon and become first t craft in solar orbit .

LUNA 24 - last soviet lunar mission to date . return soil sample in t 1976 . SOVIET venus probes VENERA 1 - first acknowledge attempt at Venus mission . transmission t lose enroute in 1961 . VENERA 2 - attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with t VENERA 3 . probe cease transmit just before encounter in t February of 1966 . no image be return . VENERA 3 - attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface . t Transmissions cease just before encounter and entire probe t become the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966 . VENERA 4 - first probe to successfully return datum while descend t through venusian atmosphere . crush by air pressure before t reach surface in 1967 . VENERA 5 and 6 mission profile t similar in 1969 . VENERA 7 - first probe to return datum from the surface of another planet t in 1970 . VENERA 8 accomplish a more detailed mission in t 1972 .

VENERA 15 - accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of section of ttplanet 's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO . VEGA 1 - accomplish with VEGA 2 first balloon probe of venusian t atmosphere in 1985 , include two lander . flyby bus go on t to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close - up in t March of 1986 . SOVIET MARS probes MARS 1 - First acknowledge Mars probe in 1962 . transmission cease t enroute the following year . ZOND 2 - first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian t surface . probe signal cease enroute in 1965 . MARS 2 - first Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on martian t surface . orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the Red t Planet in 1971 . MARS 3 - first successful soft landing on martian surface , but lander t signal cease after 90 second in 1971 . MARS 4 - attempt at orbit Mars in 1974 , brake rocket fail to t fire , probe go on into solar orbit . MARS 5 - first fully successful Soviet Mars mission , orbit Mars in t 1974 . return image of martian surface comparable to U.S. t probe MARINER 9 . MARS 6 - landing attempt in 1974 . Lander crash into the surface . MARS 7 - Lander miss Mars completely in 1974 , go into a solar orbit t with its flyby bus . phobos 1 - first attempt to land probe on surface of Mars ' large t moon , Phobos . probe fail enroute in 1988 due to t human  computer error . phobos 2 - attempt to land probe on martian moon Phobos . the probe do t enter Mars orbit in early 1989 , but signal cease one week t before schedule Phobos landing . while there have be talk of Soviet Jupiter , Saturn , and even interstellar probe within the next thirty year , no major step have yet be take with these project . more intensive study of the Moon , Mars , Venus , and various comet have be plan for the 1990s , and a Mercury mission to orbit and land probe on the tiny world have be plan for 2003 . how the many change in the former Soviet Union ( now the Commonwealth of Independent States ) will affect the future of their space program remain to be see . japanese planetary MISSIONS SAKIGAKE ( MS - T5 ) be launch from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on January 8 1985 , and approach Halley 's Comet within about 7 million km on March 11 , 1986 . the spacecraft be carry three instru- ment to measure interplanetary magnetic field  plasma wave  solar wind , all of which work normally now , so ISAS make an Earth swingby by Sakigake on January 8 , 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth 's . the close approach be at 23h08m47s ( JST  UTC9h ) on January 8 , 1992 . the geocentric distance be 88,997 km . this be the first planet - swingby for a japanese spacecraft . during the approach , Sakigake observe the geotail . some geotail passage will be schedule in some year hence . the second Earth - swingby will be on June 14 , 1993 ( at 40 Re ( Earth 's radius ) ) , and the third October 28 , 1994 ( at 86 re ) . HITEN , a small lunar probe , be launch into Earth orbit on January 24 , 1990 . the spacecraft be then know as MUSES - A , but be rename to Hiten once in orbit . the 430 lb probe loop out from Earth and make its first lunary flyby on March 19 , where it drop off its 26 lb midget satellite , HAGOROMO . Japan at this point become the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon , join the Unites States and USSR . the small spacecraft , Hagoromo , remain in orbit around the Moon . an apparently break transistor radio cause the japanese space scientist to lose track of it . Hagoromo 's rocket motor fire on schedule on March 19 , but the spacecraft 's tracking transmitter fail immediately . the rocket firing of Hagoromo be optically confirm use the Schmidt camera ( 105 - cm , F3.1 ) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan . Hiten make multiple lunar flyby at approximately monthly interval and perform aerobrake experiment use the Earth 's atmosphere . hiten make a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST ( UTC9h ) on February 15 , 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon 's surface ( 35.3n , 9.7e ) and fire its propulsion system for about ten minute to put the craft into lunar orbit . the following be the orbital calculation result after the approach : tApoapsis altitude : about 49,400 km tperiapsis altitude : about 9,600 km tInclinationt : 34.7 deg ( to ecliptic plane ) tperiodtt : 4.7 day PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES I also recommend read the follow work , categorize in three group : General overviews , specific book on particular space mission , and periodical source on space probe . this list be by no means complete- it be primarily design to give you place to start your research through generally available work on the subject . if anyone can add pertinent work to the list , it would be greatly appreciate . though naturally I recommend all the book list below , I think it would be good if you start out with the general overview book , in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area . I also recommend that you pick up some good , up - to - date general work on astronomy and the Sol system , to give you some extra background . Most of these book and periodical can be find in any good public and university library . some of the more recently publish work can also be purchase in andor order through any good mass- market bookstore .

229;' I assume you be post to encourage comment - how much history have Tony Campello read ? not much it seem . it be good to hear that there be a few reasonable Christians about . if only those christian scientist would take note . ( in Australia there be a very strong movement , a bunch of christian scientist who believe that every single event in the bible be exactly true , and that there be a rational explanation for it all that can be justify by use the law of physics . for example , there be a few chap who be try to prove that the age of the universe be 6000 year old , and that the error in conventional calculation be the result of the fact that the speed light have be rapidly decay over the year , and this have not be account for . :- ) or ( of course ) , that he never exist , and the bible be a story , and be never intend to become a manifesto for a billion people . do Tony follow that one up ? million of people have die for a lie . this point be difficult to substantiate since it be not well define ( a great many religious argument work in that way ) , but consider the many aztec warrior who sacrifice themselves to their god in the belief that this act would bring they victory of the spanish invader . the list be endless . the Aztecs lose , BTW . that be perfectly reasonable , but it be not ground for I ( or anyone ) to become a christian . more to the point , it do not add weight to the claim that Jesus be the real thing . have you ever see a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany ? more to the point , do Tony mention this ? one could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleague fool , or illogical man , their support of Hitler be base ( I presume ) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principle . obviously my argument be invalid if Tony think that Hitler be sane .... Hmmm .... I don't think his argument warrant the use of a Therefore ... this be ( unfortunately ) what alot of religious discussion I have have with people result in - quote the bible . the only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible be to treat the story as some sort of metaphorical representation of the message that the author be try to present . if someone try to interpret part of the bible literally , he or she will end up in all sort of shit . Tony 's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the event describe in the bible take place , but to convince someone , who think the bible be total fiction , that Jesus be real by quote the book be totally pointless . for example , in mathematic you can not say a be equal to b because a be equal to b. that would possibly explain why there have so many people be kill in religious war , and why there be hundred of different version all claim to be correct . it I think if you post this part to alt.religion you would get more flame than here :-) . I have never really understand why the emotional sentiment of a stranger should be of interest to other people . someone famous say that there two evil in life , polititian and church , one rule by fear of the living , the other by fear of the dead . if I be press I could probably find the exact quotation .

1653;'  Moral Driver distinction delete  compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy , where there be an urge and an object . the jealousy do not technically exist until the object be apparent . however , the capacity to be jealous be presumably still there even though it be not detectable . your description of the Unbilical take I three pass to understand ( ! ) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree . I think our two definition can sit side by side without too much trouble , though . I haven't attempt to define the reason behind the Moral Driver ( only hint through the essence of each Moral ) . your definition hint that animal be also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it be easy to anthropomorphize with these animal . be this possible or have I misunderstood ? my p.s . thought fall roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and his writing on Utilitarianism . I have no particular plan ( except to do my bit - personal ethic and social work ) . my opinion ( for what it be worth ) be that the Authority for each Moral must be increase somehow , and that this will probably take several generation to be effective . I don't think that the list of Morals have change for Society significantly , though . the Authority element may come from our authority figure and role model ( see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work   Mavis Klein  for reference ) and this be what give rise to a deterioration of moral standard in the long term . I've have some more thought on my definition : I've be think that I should add Moral Character to the list of definition in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature ( ie . the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities ) . a suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature be the set of frequency and the choose 'amplitudes ' , and the Moral Character be the spectrum over time . Conscience be a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between action in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seem to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted . I think Conscience be manifest when a decision be make at a give time which compromise one 's Moral Nature . my Conscience fit in more with Freud 's SuperEgo ( plus the Moral Driver ) with the stimulous be the urge or Freud 's Id. the reasoning that I mention before be Freud 's ego , I suppose . if the Moral Driver be part of the I d then the reason why Conscience cut in unbidden be partially explain . the question be what provide the stimulous to activate the Moral driver ? .

( mechanism be not know but several plausible one exist ) ( also to be fair it be note that the  bright  burster be probably in the LMC , suggest theorist might be wrong back then ... ) tas the Sun be not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy ( a local disk population be rule out completely at this stage ) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out , the energy then get large , the mechanism of get NS out that far become questionable , and we should start to see for example the Andromeda 's burster . tthe datum be consistent with either a oort cloud distribution ( but only just ) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum . or , it can be a cosmological distance ( hence isotropy ) and the edge be the edge of the Universe -- ) if at cosmological distance you need very high energy ( to detect ) and a very compact source ( for spectrum ) , ergo a neutron star collide with another neutron star or black hole . even then get the spectrum be very hard , but conceivable . tif we know anything about physics at that level , the burster be not due to quantum black hole or cosmic string , wrong spectrum for one thing . the situation be far complicate by recent claim that there be two class of source -- )  in the collide NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS - NS and NS - BH collision scenario respectively  my own pet theory be that it 's Flying saucer enter hyperspace :-) but the reason I be ask be that most everyone assume that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole , I just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place they close in . if you can think of one , remember to invite I to Stockholm ...

55;' this be one of those yes , but thing . It 's true that a hydraulically pressurize tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube , but even at 2000 PSI level a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily , though it 's straight - on compressive strength be high , and it 's torsional resistance increase be practically nil . on the other grasp member , there 's no doubt that hydraulic leverage exist in nature . tree root be an example . give time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increase . kangaroo 3 - limbed ? I don't think so . if you take the view that the tail be a limb , then monkey and kangaroo be 5 - limbed . I think the tail be a different kind of structure , grossly enlarge in the case of the kangaroo , but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion . I don't know much about panda thumb , so I'll ask be it opposable ? well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent , but I'll bring a couple of line of argument to bear to try to show why I don't think it 's likely . first let I say that when I say intelligent I mean complex behavior in response to novel situation on a level with , or great than , human tool use and tool building . IE assume suitable manipulator be present on the creature to allow it to alter it 's enviroment in a plan way , it will do so . That be certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence , but it will suffice for a putative technological alien . now no one know exactly what make a brain capable of thought , but it 's generally accept that one of the criterion be a certain level of complexity . this be generally determine by the number of neuron cell , and their interconnection . so a creature the size of a lemur wouldn't have enough neuron to support complex thought . this argument be considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur . There 's room for a large brain , though no indication that one ever develop . one reason this may be true be neuronic speed . the electrochemical message that trigger neuron require time to propagate . this make it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movement of very large creature . so there 's little selection pressure for such brain . instead , a simple distribute network evolve . this doesn't rule out intelligent dinosaur , but it point in that direction . then there be the thermodynamic argument . a tiny creature like the lemur need to eat frequently because it 's internal heat be rapidly lose due to it 's high surface to volume ratio . I contend that a creature that must spend most of it 's time and energy feeding won't have the time to develop and exercise intelligence . that argument may be somewhat weak . the dinosaur 's problem be the reverse , it must moderate it 's heat production because it 's high volume to surface ratio make it tend to retain waste heat . I'm assume that a certain temperature range be optimal for chemical reactivity reason for productive neuron function . so creature would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of human if they be carbon base . that tend to rule out cold blooded creature as potential home of intelligence . some people contend that some of the dinosaur may have be warm blooded . but for a creature the size of a brontosaur , it 's activity level would have to be restrain or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat . whale be similar size , but they can reject heat to the ocean , a much more efficient sink than air . I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself , a certain degree of activity in interact with the environment be necessary . IE monkey curiousity . I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity . Gary ';2

Geez Allen any organization have cost but there be a heck of a difference in legitimate cost , such as library and other thing that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally state it . you state that wrap be on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentence down you say be not true . which be it Allen ? as you have post on this subject Allen , you state that wrap be over and above overhead and be a seperate charge . you admit here that this be wrong . Nasa have a line item budget every year . I have see it Allen . get some number from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap number and then howl to high heaven about it . until you do that you be bark in the wind . integration could be do well at the center . Apollo integration be do here at Msfc and that do not turn out so bad . the philosophy of Reston be totally wrong Allen . there you have a bunch of people who be completely remove from the work that they be try to oversee . there be no way that will ever work . it have never work in any large scale project that it be ever try on . could you imagine a Reston like set up for Apollo ? oh you be full of it Allen on this one . I agree that JSC screw up big . they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that cause it replace . to make a stupid statement like that just show how deep your bias go . come to MSFC for a couple of week and you will find out just how wrong you really be . maybe not , people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the fact be contrary to it . I agree that integration be the single most important part of a successful large scale effort . what I completly disagree with be seperate that integration function from the people that be do the work . it be call leadership Allen . that be what make Apollo work . final responsibility for the success of Apollo be hold by less than 50 people . that be leadership and responsibility . there be neither when you have any organization set up as Reston be . you could take the same people and move they to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much well job . why do it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem ? if they be on site and part of the process then the problem would have never get out of hand in the first place . there be one heck of a lot I do not know Allen , but one thing I do know be that for a project to be successful you must have leadership . I remember all of the turn over at Reston that keep SSF program in shamble for year do you ? it be lack of responsibility and leadership that be the program problem . lack of leadership from the White House , Congress and at Reston . Nasa be only a symptom of a great national problem . you be so narrowly focused in your effort that you do not see this . no , I be say that if they be locate at JSC it never would have happen in the first place . I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that be at reston be on site at JSC the problem never would have happen , totally ignore the lack of leadership of congress . this many head hydra that have grow up at NASA be the true problem of the Agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias be only indicative of your position .

Andrew , the myth to which I refer be the convoluted counterfeit athiest have create to make religion appear absurd . rather than approach religion ( include Christainity ) in a rational manner and debate its claim -as the be stated- , atheist concoct outrageous parody and then hold the religious accountable for belief they don't have . what be more accurately oxymoric be the a term like , reasonable atheist . Bill :  divine justice . accord to the most fundamental doctrine of :  Christianity , when the first man sin , he be at that time the : you accuse he of reference mythology , then you procede to : launch your own xtian mythology . ( this time meet all the : requirement of myth . ) Here be a good example of of what I say above . read the post again , I say , acoorde to ... , which mean I be refer to christian doctrine ( as I understand it ) , if I be speak for myself you'll know it . my purpose in posting be to present a basic overview of Christain doctrine since it seem germane . Bill :  with those who pretend not to know what be be say and what it :  mean . when atheist claim that they do -not- know if God exist and :  don't know what he want , they contradict the Bible which clearly say :  that -everyone- know . the authority of the Bible be its claim to be : ... should I repeat what I write above for the sake of get : it across ? you may trust the Bible , but your trust it doesn't : make it any more credible to I . : if the Bible say that everyone know , that 's clearly reason : to doubt the Bible , because not everyone know your alleged : god 's allege existance . again I be paraphrase christian doctrine which be very clear on this point , your dispute be not with I ... Bill :  refute while the species - wide condemnation be justify . those that :  claim that there be no evidence for the existence of God or that his will be :  unknown , must deliberately ignore the Bible- the ignorance itself be :  no excuse . : 1 ) no , they don't have to ignore the Bible . the Bible be far : from universally accept . the Bible be not a proof of god- : it be only a proof that some people have think that there : be a god . ( or do it prove even that ? they might have be : write it as series of fiction short - story . as in the : case of Dionetics . ) assume the writer believe it , the : only thing it could possibly prove be that they believe it . : and that be ignore the problem of whether or not all the : interpretation and Biblical - philosopher be correct . : 2 ) there be people who have truly never hear of the Bible . : 3 ) again , read the FAQ . 1 ) here again you miss the point . the Bible itself be not the point , it 's what it contain . it make no difference who accpet the Bible or even who 's unaware of its existence , Christians hold that it apply universally because mankind share the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of God . 2 ) see above 3 ) if you read my post with same care as read the FAQ , we wouldn't be have this conversation . Bill :  freedom . you be free to ignore God in the same way you be free to :  ignore gravity and the consequence be inevitable and well know :  in both case . that an atheist can't accept the evidence mean only : Bzzt ... wrong answer ! : gravity be directly there . it doesn't stop exert a direct and : rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it . God , on the : other hand , doesn't generally show up in the supermarket , except : on the tabloid . God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence . : gravity be obvious- god aren't . as I say , the evidence be there , you just don't accept it , here at least we agree . Bill :  secondly , human reason be very comforatble with the concept of God , so :  much so that it be , in itself , intrinsic to our nature . human reason :  always come back to the question of God , in every generation and in : no , human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of : god- it have usually come back to the existance of god . : in other word , it doesn't generally come back to the xtian : god , it come back to whether there be any god . and , in much : of oriental philosophic history , it generally doesn't pop up as : the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural force : be and which one be out there . from a world - wide view , : human nature just make we wonder how the universe come to : be andor what force(s ) be currently in control . a natural : tendancy to believe in God only exist in religious wishful : think . yes , human reason do always come back to the existence of God , we're have this discussion be we not ? Bill :  I say all this to make the point that Christianity be eminently :  reasonable , that Divine justice be just and human nature be much :  different than what atheist think it be . whether you agree or not : you certainly be not correct on human nature . you be , at : the least , base your view on a completely eurocentric : approach . try look at the outside world as well when : you attempt to sum up all of humanity . well this be interesting , Truth be to be determine by it politically correct content . grant it 's extremely unhip to be a WASP male , and anything european be contemptable , but I think this kind of dialogue , the purpose of a.a , be to get at the truth of thing . but then I remember the oxymoron , reasonalble atheist , and I understand .

1411;' Mr DeCenso , in spite of require scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas , reject that the scholarly opinion of the those scholar and then rephrase those scholar opinion on the subject : and actually , if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw , you will find that it do denote success . those scholar do indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide be successful . as I point out , I recently check several Lexicons : tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament , Louw and Nida tRobinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament , Grimm tWord study Concordance , Tynsdale tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other t early Christian Writings , Bauer - Arndt - Gingrich tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon , Perschbacher a couple simply state hang oneself , and a couple be more explicit and state that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hang . a couple also note that the meaning of one the root word for apacgw be strangle , throttle or choke ( which pretty much invalidate the guy who suggest to David Joslin that Judas be hang upside down ) . one of the good reference though , Robinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament , not only state the translation , it give both the root word , the literal translation , relate greek word which use the same root , and also other present specific example of the word in greek literature ( to give further context ) . the word apagchw have two root word : gchw be the to strangle root , and the root word apo mean literally away . this root word be include in word which denote a transition . it can mean a transition in place ( eg : the greek word apagello mean to send a message ) . Apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death . Robinson specifically make comparison to the word apokteiuo , which mean to kill . in literal meaning the word apacgw mean to throttle , strangle to put out of the way , and implicitly denote a change in life state ( ie : away from life , to death ) . so while the word apacgw do mean to hang , it specifically denote a death as well . thus Robinson be quite specific when he state that it mean to hang oneself , to end one 's life by hang . he then note the the use of apacgw in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context . he present that example of apacgw as be use to explicitly mean suicide by hang . now since there be a perfectly good word for strangle , without the add denotation of death , and as you insist that the Bible be write by God , and every word be precicely correct , you be stick with the complete meaning of apacgw ( ie : since the word apacgw be use , then death be denote as the result ) . by the way , I note that Mr DeCenso also present an example of apacgw : note Mr DeCenso , as you say , the septuagint be a translation from Hebrew to Greek , and you have not show the original meaning of the Hebrew ( ie the the Hebrew say and die ) , and thus whether it be simply echo in the Greek . it should also be point out that , regardless of the add and die , the correct translation would still be apacgw , as the man do indeed die from strangulation ( redundant , but correct ) . far , we have evidence that the septuagint be repeatedly rewrite and reedite ( which include version which contradict each other ) , and such editing be not even necessarily execute by Greeks . thus I be not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stand , as a paragon of ancient greek . so , what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso , be an example , in ancient greek , of someone commit apacgw and survive . otherwise I would see you as simply make worthless assertion without correspond evidence . now I would note Mr DeCenso , that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrive exegisis , I pretty much find it false . thus , I think that if you be go to add to the text , something over and above what the source clearly say , then you have well have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it . by the way , as to Mr Rose 's statement about tree around the potter 's field : unless Mr Rose can show that these tree be two thousand year old , or that there be 2000 year old stump there , or have a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mention such tree , then it be inappropriate for he to assert that the present placement of tree prove the location of the tree two thousand year ago ( after all , thing change ) . now as to your other argument , ie : that the money Judas use be not the same as the 30 silver : true , Peter ( or the author of act ) do not specifically call Judas ' betrayal an iniquity , but for that matter , neither do John specifically call Judas ' action an iniquity either . Further John 13:29 do not say that Judas take some think that because , Judas have the money box , Jesus be tell he buy what we need for the feast- or that he should give something to the poor , so after receive the morsel he immediately go out , and it be night . note that it be say that Judas leave , it do not say that he take the money box . thus when I see your explanation it still seem to I you would choose the a an unproven iniquity , mention by another author , in a different book , write at a different time , over the iniquity explicitly mention by the author of act . I find this force and contrive . of course this particular argument become moot , since we have have see evidence that apacgw mean suicide . you see , since Judas ' hanging be successful , he could not have spend the money mention in John 13:29 , because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal be on the high holy day ( ie : Passover ) , and thus he could not have spend the money before kill himself the next day . thus the money which buy the Field of blood would have to have be the 30 piece of silver ( of course he get the 30 piece of silver that night as well , and thus couldn't have spend that either . oh dear , I believe that the house of card be comme down ) . maybe we should at this point , discuss now whether Jesus be crucify on Friday or Saturday as that be now part of the argument about Judas . by the way , as to where the prophesy of the potter 's field come from ( ie : the mention of it in Matthew ) , you say : I be remind you now to discuss it now . It 's all part of the same verse we be discuss , and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestep these issue . ttttLater , ttttDave Butler tA wise man proportion his belief to the evidence . ttttDavid Hume , Philosopher ttttAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding ';3
557;' dear Rob , sometimes I do come across condesending , and I be sorry I come across that way at time . thank you for the reproach , I really do appreciate it . I'll try to get well . Rob , at the same time , I have also learn that some people respond to the gentle approach while other respond only at a harsh rebuke . Brian K. , so far , only respond to the latter . and I be glad he respond at all . in both case of approach , my intention be to be love . I be make no excuse for myself if I be come across condesending . I apologize for that . Rob , sometimes Brian K. come across as honest . I know this . but Brian K. vasillate back and forth . one post look honest- the next be an excuse . now he want I to explain the universe in 50 word or less . I think Brian Kendig be really try but he be too comfortable with his set of excuse . I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself . if he really want to know , he will ask question and stop assert irrelevant excuse which have nothing to do with my God . I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decision without be sidetrack with the temptation to mock God . from my perspective Rob , when I look at Brian Kendig , I see a man stand out in the middle of a highway . off into the distance I see a Mack truck head right for he , but Brian K. be face away from the oncoming truck . he doesn't see it . Here 's be how I see the dialog : I : Brian K , please step aside before you get run over . BK : there be no truck . I : turn around at look . BK : no . I : look ! you will be healthy if you do take a look at the oncoming truck . BK : no . explain to I why truck exist . I : turn around or you will run over . BK : no . I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow be Tuesday . I : you blind fool ! why do you choose ignorance ? you have nothing to lose if you look . but if do not look , you will certainly lose your life . I do not want to see you squash all over the road . BK : it be my life to lose . I rather not look . besides , a truck run over I will not harm I . and by the way , I really have an open mind . so be my motivation to belittle Brian , or to love Brian the good I know how ? I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out . because million if not billion of people fall into the same category . perhaps all people fall have fall into this category at one time in their life . I have . I can now see the truck behind Brian . my hope be that Brian will look and will see the ramification of the truck come towards he . my hope be that Brian will want to step out of the way . my fear , though , be that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway , where he will certainly get run over . but if he so choose , he so choose , and there be nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind . for it be his choice . but at this very moment , Brian hasn't get even that far . he be still at the point where he do not want to look . sure he move his eyeball to appease I , but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture . so far he be satisfied with his glimpse of the mountain off in the distance .

1905;' I'm work upon a game use an isometric perspective , similar to that use in Populous . basically , you look into a room that look similar to the follow : xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx 2 xxxx 1 xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx 3  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the good thing about this perspective be that you can look and move around in three dimension and still maintain your peripheral vision .    since your viewpoint be always the same , the routine can be hard - coded for a particular vantage . in my case , wall two 's rise edge have a slope of 14 . ( I'm also use Mode X , 320x240 ) . i've run into two problems- i'm sure that other reader have try this before , and have perhaps formulate their own opinion : 1 ) the routine for draw wall 1  2 be trivial , but when I run a packed-planar image through they , I be dismay by the jaggie . I'm now consider some anti - aliasing routine ( speed be not really necessary ) . be it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skew , thus be assure of nice image , or be this too much of a burden ? 2 ) Wall 3 present a problem- the algorithm I use tend to overly distort the original . I try to decide on paper what pixel go where , and fail . have anyone come up with method for map a planar to crosswise sheared shape ? currently I take : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 and produce : 1 2 3 4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24 9 10 11 12 53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16 57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32 61 62 63 64 Line 1 follow the slope . line 2 be directly under line 1 . line 3 move up a line and leave 4 pixel . line 4 be under line 3 . this fill the shape exactly without any unfilled pixel . but it cause distortion . have anyone come up with a well way ? perhaps it be necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skew ? be there any other particularly sticky problem with this perspective ? I be plan on have hide plane removal by use z - buffering . location be store in ( x , y , z ) form .    for those of you who notice , the top line of wall 2 ( and wall 1 )  be  parallel with its bottom line . this be why there appear to be an optical illusion ( ie . it appear to be either the inside or outside of a cube , depend on your mood ) . there be no vanish point . this simplify the drawing code for object ( which don't have to change size as they move about in the room ) . I've decide that this approximation be alright , since small displacement at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective draw . hopefully the context of the picture ( ie . chair on the floor , torch hang on the wall ) will dispell any visual ambiguity . thank in advance for any help .

What 's more , even if Josephus happen to be legitimate , it would prove nothing . scholar speak of the weight of evidence . far more independent evidence would be require to validate your claim . until forthcoming , your belief be base on faith .

590;' ra  Robert , you keep make reference to orthodox belief , and say ra  thing like it be hold that ... ( cf . Kermit thread ) . on what ra  exact body of theology be you draw for what you call orthodox ? Orthodox be a compound word . it come from 'orthos ' ( straight , true , right ) and from 'doxa ' ( opinion , doctrine , teaching ) . I use orthodox to refer to 'right teaching. ' right teaching be derive from let God speak to we through the Bible . this can be from read simple truth in the scripture and by use the Bible to interpret the Bible . ra  who be that hold that Luke mean what you say he mean ? I think that it be apparent from read the scripture that be pertinent . Luke 23:43 record Christ 's promise to the repentant thief who hang on an adjacent cross : truly I say to you , today you will be with I in paradise . but be it not until later that Christ rise from the dead and ascend to heaven ? if Christ Himself be not in heaven until Sunday , how could the repentant thief have be there with he ? the answer lie in the location of paradise when Jesus die . apparently paradise be not exalt to heaven until Easter Day . Jesus refer to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and Lazarus as Abraham 's Bosom , to which the godly beggar Lazarus be carry by the angel after his decease ( Luke 16:19 - 31 ) . thus Abraham 's Bosom refer to the place where the soul of the redeemed wait till the day of Christ 's Resurrection . it be not yet lift to heaven but it may well have be a section of hade ( Hebrew : Sheol ) , reserve for believer who have die in the faith but would not be admit into the glorious presence of God in heaven until the price of redemption have actually be pay on Calvary- or even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with the Father . Doubtless it be the infernal paradise that the soul of Jesus and the repentant thief repair after they each die on Friday afternoon . but on Sunday , after the rise Christ have first appear to Mary Magdalene ( John 20:17 ) and her two companion ( Matthew 28:9 ) , presumably he then take up with he to glory all the inhabitant of infernal paradise ( include Abraham , Lazarus , and the repentant thief ) . we read in Ephesians 4:8 concern Christ : ascend on high , he lead captivity captive- he give gift unto man . verse 9 continue : but what do  he ascended ' mean but that he also descend to the low part of the earth ? -i.e . , to hade . verse 10 add : he who descend be the same as he who ascend above all the heaven . presumably he lead the whole band of liberated captive from hade ( i.e. , the whole population of preresurrection paradise ) up to the glory of heaven . ra  whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passage be ra  challenge , your only response seem to be that one need merely to ra  look at the Bible in order to see the truth , but what of those who ra  see biblical thing differently from you ? I think that this characterization be faulty . whenever my 'personal interpretation ' be question , I usually give a reason . as for those that see thing differently , please , put forward where there be a valid difference , and we can discuss it . I seem to be see from you the notion that any difference in how one view the Bible be somehow legitimate , except , or course , for the stuff that I glean from it . put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can have a discussion on that topic . but to decry something that I put forward , without put forward something else to discuss , and to dismiss what I put forward while give credence to other allege view that have yet to be put forward be simply be contentious . ra  be we to simply assume that you be the only one who really ra  understand it ? if you believe that something that I have draw from Scripture be wrong , then please , show I from scripture where it be wrong . simply state that there be other view be not a proof . show it to I from Scripture and then we can go on .

I realize that it be not possible to penetrate such logic , but be there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything , and far that an attempt to reconcile imply a lack of omniscience ? what you be do here be project human weakness onto your god . but all human be sinner , thus all pre - jesus human should have be punish with death . we aren't punish with sin now , of course , because God have change . he require a brutal , sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow we to sin without immediate death . yet he do so now . he have change . the sadistic murder of his own son have make he more tolerant of our sin . besides , his midst be everywhere , so your statement be meaningless . he tolerate sin in Hell , which surely be in his midst as well . also , give that he be all - know , he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sin , as well as when and where , so what do tolerance have to do with anything . all of this be absolute nonsense , unless your god be not indeed all - knowing and all - powerful , or unless he doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affair that you claim . not relevant . the claim of kindness and lovingness be make by you in reference to your god . the nature of his creation  victim be not at issue . I see : an all - know god who do not know what the ultimate outcome would be , and an all - powerful god who have no choice in the matter . mindmush . do I miss something ? do you give some indication at to why a KIND and love god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creation to achieve salvation ?

I use well in part to indicate that science currently have a time of it with why and who , so these domain be mostly ignore . I also attempt to be brief , which no doubt confuse the matter . as an aside , for science I should have write how and when . nobody seem to argue over what . seem to I that the answer would vary from individual to individual . I'm not try to be evasive on this , but from a societal perspective , religion work . on the other hand , sometimes it be abuse and misuse , and many suffer , which you know . but the net result seem positive , this from the anthropological perspective on human affair . you might call I a neo - fruedian insofar as I think the masse can't get along without religion . not that generally they be incapable- they just don't , and for myriad reason , but the main one seem to be the promise of immortality . very seductive , that immortality . therefore it seem that theologian be well equipped than the other you mention for dispense answer to who and why . I suggest that this hold regardless of the truth in their answer to who and why simply because people believe . in the end , spiritual belief be just as real as scientific fact and explanation ( caution to some : do not take this out of context ) . no . in fact , I don't think it be close now , at least for some individual . Isn't there a group of theoretical physicist who argue that matter be create from nothing in a Big Bang singularity ? this approach might presuppose an absence of who and why , except that it seem it could be argue that something have to be responsible for nothing ? maybe that something doesn't have to be supernatural , maybe just mechanistic . but that be a tough one for people today to grasp . in any case , theory without empirical datum be not explanation , but then your question do not require datum . in other word , I agree that theorize ( within scientific parameter ) be just as scientific as explain . so the answer be , who and why be not close to scientist , but I sense that science in these realm be currently very inadequate . datum will be necessary for improvement , and that seem a long way off , if ever . Pretty convoluted here- I hope I've make sense . I agree generally . but I prefer to put it this way - the  question  of how , when , who and why be not open to inquiry . during the Enlightenment , reason be reponsible for question the theological answer to how and when , and not , for the most part , who and why . Science be thus bear out of the naturalists ' curiosity , eventually cart away the how and when while largely leave behind the who and why . the ignorant , the selfish , the intolerant , and the arrogant , of course , still claim authority in all four domain . much oblige .

1329;' stuff delete I reiterate that I would agree with you that there be little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an . in islamic history , as well , apostasy have rarely be punish . Belief be consider a matter of conscience and since there be to be no compulsion in the matter of belief , apostate have be generally leave to believe or not believe as they will . however , when an apostate make attack upon God and his Messenger the situation change . now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charge - perhaps charge of sedition , treason , spying , etc . if the person make a public issue of their apostasy or mount public attack ( as oppose to arguement ) against Islam , the situation be likewise complicated . if the person spread slander or broadcast falsehood , again the situation change . the punishment vary accord to the situation the apostate be in . anyhow , the charge of aggravate apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie 's case . there be a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and be in the situation where someone unilaterally wage war ( by their action ) , create disorder , make mischief , etc . against the Muslims and create a situation that result in harm to Muslims . here , a small group or even a single individual could be say to be engage in such a practise . in other word , there be a clear difference between a formal war situation ( where two clearly define party wage war , conclude treaty , exchange prisoner , etc . ) , and deal with attack that come from isolated individual or group against Islam . it be the second situation , the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that would apply in the case of Rushdie . the matter of Rushdie be not a simple matter of ban an offensive book ( ban the book be secondary ) - a full set of circumstance follow the publication of the book come into play as well , include the death of many Muslims , and Rushdie 's ( and his publisher ) medium game . I be not sure which hadith you be refer to above . I believe that one of the qur'anic verse on which the fatwa be base be 5:33 . every verse in the Qur'an have a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way be the understanding ( the tafsir ) of the verse restrict solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it be reveal . if this be the case then we could say that all the law and regulation that be reveal when the Muslims be not involve in conflict , should be suspend when they be at war . the logic do not follow . in complex , real - life situation , there may be many verse and many hadith which can all be relate to a single , complicated situation . the internal relationship between these verse may be quite complex , such that arrive at an understanding of how the verse interlock and how each apply to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task . it be not necessarily a simple this or that process . there may be many parameter involve , there may be a large context in which a particular situation should be view . all these matter impinge on the situation . in other word there be a great deal involve in decipher the Qur'an . the qur'an ask we to reflect on its verse , but this reflection must entail more than simply read a verse and its corresponding hadith . if the reflection be for the sake of increase personal piety , then each person have his own level of understanding and there be no harm in that . however , if the reflection be in order to decide matter that pertain to the State , to the gestation of law and ruling , to the gestation of society , the dispensing of justice , the guidance of the community , then there be certain minimum requirement of understand that one should achieve . Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as - Sadiq(a.s . ) relate some of these requirement , as teach by the Prophet(S.A. ) , in a hadith : ... he who do not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one , and a specific one from a general one , and a decisive from an ambiguous- and do not differentiate between a permission and an obligation , and do not recognize a verse of meccan period from a Medinite one , and do not know the circumstance of revelation , and do not understand the technical word of the Qur'an ( whether simple or compound)- and do not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure , and be ignorant of advance and delay ( in its verses)- and do not distinguish the clear from the deep , nor the manifest from the esoteric , nor the beginning from the termination- and be unaware of the question and the answer , the disjoining and the joining , and the exception and the all - inclusive , and be ignorant of an adjective of a precede noun that explain the subsequent one- and be unaware of the emphasize subject and the detailed one , the obligatory law and the permission , the place of the duty and rule , and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful- and do not know the joined word , and the word that be relate to those come before they , or after they - then such a man do not know the Qur'an- nor be he among the people of the Qur'an ..... base on these and other hadith , and in accordance with many qur'anic verse ( why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding ( tafaqquh ) in religion and to warn people when they return to they , so that they may beware . ( 9:122 ) ) , a science of jurisprudence arise . the requirement for a person to be consider a mujtahid ( one who can pronounce on matter of law and religion ) be many . I've list a few major division below - there be , of course , many subdivision within these heading . - Knowledge of arabic ( syntax , conjugation , root , semantic , oratory ) . - Knowledge of tafsir and principle of tafsir . - Logic ( mantiq ) - a knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitter ( rijal ) - Knowledge of the principle of juriprudence ( Qur'an , Sunnah , Consensus , Reasoning ) the study of Qur'an and sunnah for purpose of law involve : - discussion of imperative ( awamir ) - discussion of negative imperative ( nawahi ) - discussion of generality and particularity ( aam wa khas ) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meaning - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogate the principle of application of the law involve : - principle of exemption - principle of precaution - principle of option - principle of mastery the jurisprudent be bind to go through a very rigorous process in pronounce judgement on a give situation . it be not a matter of look at one verse and one hadith . now no one should blindly follow anyone , but there be a difference between blind follow and accede to the opinion of someone who be clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself . there be the the fuqaha ( religious scholar ) be the trustee of the Prophet , as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desire , pleasure , and wealth of this world . the Prophet ( S.A. ) be ask : o Messenger of God ! how may we know if they so concern themselves ? he ( S.A. ) reply : by see whether they follow the rule power . if they do that , fear for your religion and shun they . I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhab to comment on how this hadith apply to they or to the contemporary scholar who base themselves upon they . the Prophet also refer to the fuqaha as the fortress of Islam . my only point be to make it clear that arrive at a legal judgement call into play a certain amount of expertise - the specific of this expertise be delineate in the Qur'an and hadith . those who acquire this expertise be praise in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matter that affect society , state , and religion be caution . the only reason I say anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group , be because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa ( that be , apostasy ) , be wrong . when one discuss something they should at least base their discussion on fact . secondly , Khomeini be condemn as a heretic because he supposedly claim to be infallible - another instance of create a straw man and then beat he .

I have hope this would let I do simple animation . however , I have discover that simply perform incremental rotation on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis . now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there must be another way around this .

December be not a drop dead date , unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission . I suspect , the BUS-1 , may not have enough basic thrust for the HST re - boost . it mayu need big tank , or big thruster . my understanding be the second HST servicing mission be not a contingency . my understanding be the mission need both a new FOC and work on the electrical system , plus another re - boost . somehow , I think the cost of an expendable smt will be less then  500 million . and the extra stuff be real cheap .

I understand that the EVA suit be one of the hard thing to keep clean . but I still don't know where the idea be come from that HST  needs  a re - boost . we have many problem but our orbit be the least of they . there be certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in December .

Integration , Dennis , isn't overhead . Dennis , Reston have be the only NASA agency work to reduce cost . when WP 02 be hemorage out a billion   , the center you love so much where do their good to cover it up and ignore the problem . Reston be the only place you would find people actually interested in solve the problem and build a station . when you have a bit more experience Dennis , you will realize that integration isn't overhead . it be the single most important part of a successful large scale effort . the story you refer to say that some NASA people blame it on Congress . suprise suprise . the fact remain that it be the center you support so much who cover up the overhead and wouldn't address the problem until the press publish the story . be you say the Reston manager where wrong to get NASA to address the overrun ? you approve of what the center do to cover up the overrun ? you should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport cost for resuply . that come from the Shuttle budget . what they where say be that operational cost could be cut in half plus transport .

I don't agree with it- now try prove , through    some objective moral test , that my disagreeing be incorrect . )     your claim , which you have delete now be not universal   not objective .   I've delete it now , in the interest of brevity . go back a step  and you'll see it be still in your post . yes , that be my claim- if you  can refute it , then please do so . firstly , an apology . you hadn't delete your claim , and I be mistake in say you have . sorry for any offence cause . secondly , how can I refute your definition ? I can only point up its logical implication , and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other area . indeed , by your definition , an objective x be an oxymoron , for all x. I have no quibble with that belief , other than that it be useless , and that objective be a perfectly good word .   so , what  be  objective ? not the age of the universe , anyway , as I show   above .   how many age can the universe have , and still be internally self-  consistent ? i'd be amazed if it be more than one . how many different  moral system can different member of society have - indeed , single  individual , in some case - and humanity still stick together ? beg the question . People can have many opinion about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together . you be say that the universe have a  real  age , independent of my belief about it . why ?  the age of the universe , like most scientific fact , can be  emirically verify through mean that'll give the same result no matter  who perform the testing ( albeit there be error bar that may be on the  largish side ... ) . this assume that the universe have a real age , or any kind of reality which doesn't depend on what we think . why should an extreme Biblical Creationist give a rat 's ass about the mean of which you speak ?  i've hear of no way to verify morality in a  consistent way , much less compute the error of the measurement- care to  enlighten I ? the same be true of pain , but painkiller exist , and can be predict to work with some accuracy well than a random guess . I write elsewhere that morality should be hypothesis about observe value . if a moral system make a prediction it will be well if ... , that can be test , and be falsifiable in the same way as a prediction this drug will relieve pain ...  People 's  idea  about the age of object x be  not  objective-  you can have any idea you like , and I can't stop you . Universae and  their age be another ballgame- they be what they be , and if you  dislike some detail of they , that be a problem with your  opinion  of  they . sure . assume an objective reality , and you get statement like this .  I claim that morality be an opinion of ours , and as such  subjective and individual . if I'm wrong , then some more - or - less  objectively real thing exist , which you label objective morality-  can you back up this positive claim of existence ? can you back up your positive claim above ? no . That 's because it 's an assumption . I make the same assumption about value , on the basis that there be no logical difference between the two , and the empirical basis of the two be precisely the same .    point : moral be , in essence , personal opinion . usually    ( ideally ) well - found , motivate such , but nonetheless personal . the    fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question ,    sometimes even for the same reason , do not make moral objective- it    make human somewhat alike in their opinion on that moral question ,    which can be good for the evolution of a social specie .     and if a real large lot ( nice phrase ) of people agree that there be a   football on a desk , I'm suppose to see a logical difference between the two ?   perhaps you can explain the difference to I , since you seem to see it   so clearly .   take a look on the desk - i.e. , perform a test . If(football ) then  ( accept theory ) ELSE DO ( tell people they're hallucinating ) .   now take a look at morality . see anything ? if so , please inform I  which way to look , and why to look that particular way , as oppose to  some other . get my drift ? no . just look . be you claim never to know what good mean ?     science  be a whole other matter altogether .     say you . prove that those who disagree be wrong ?   That be a simple ( ? ) matter of prove the track record of the  scientific method . I think it 's great , and should be apply to value . I may be completely wrong , but that be what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought . ';0

Love be a highly ambiguous word , of which Christians can write both the gentle word Paul use of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the conservative will quote at you :-) -- and the word of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn , Love be the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ... this be in any case rather to the side of what I be attempt to raise in my note , as will become more evident below . blechhh . I think you be misread I , rather seriously . though , give my principle that one CANNOT force one 's own notion of sin on another , and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism , Russel Turpin and other ( believer and unbeliever alike ) be under no threat of my legislate my own understanding of christian love . you misread . I can do ( and have repeatedly do ) a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibit in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it have do to human being ( in the first place ) and to respect for ( let alone love of ) God in near succession . please go back to my quote word above : the possibility that always exist be that I ( or , to revert to proper time sequence , my predecessor over the last several century ) could persuade Christian B of my case that the inquisition  do  indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love . I must also note that the majority of Christians have be so persuade . by christian argumentation , as well as by secular  both christian and non - christian  prohibition . what Mr. Turpin allude to be a tricky point : ta. I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involve t in the Inquisition . tB. the Inquisitor respond that Mother Church must , however t painful this  seem  , discipline her child for their t own good -- in this case the salvation of their soul ( or t if the torture heretic will not recant , than by bad example t deter other from the same loss - of - soul . ) ta. I point out that this justification of a failure in love t depend on a highly speculative construal of text and of t philosophical assertion that be quite undemonstrable . tb. burn I at the stake . my rhetoric have fail , but the point I be make be sustain . what be go on here have a  lot  to do with cultural baggage . in this case , the baggage include a ( nearly universal , and absolutely secular ) belief that an accuse person must prove innocence and that testimony be most believable if take under torture . the elimination of inqisitorial practice ( in those place where it  have  be eliminate , or at least greatly reduce ) have very little , if anything , to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B. Mr. Turpin be point out that , if I be a versus the Grand Inquisitor 's b , then my persuasion be not very likely to work . I know this- and in what- ever personal agony , I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney . so , one possibility fail in this case -- as it will fail in may other . at the other extreme , the persuasion will succeed when it properly should not , if it entail mistaken assumption I share with the Inquisitor . and that be potentially an even more troubling case , in that many of the victim of inquisition will have accept that they be in fact sinful ( in such random case as they may actually have be guilty of charge bring against they . ) the point be that the persuasion break down when the party do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and give the main thrust of the inquisition , against heresy , it be  bind  to break down in precisely the bad case . the conservative ( I don't think that be the right word , BTW ) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above , that he be justify in cause harm because he  think  that work to a great good . but this be a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel , as if one 's theory about sin entitle one to cast aside Jesus ' word on deal with sinner ( cf . Matthew 5:39ff ) . I be a radical Christian  only  in that I take the gospel seriously . well , the whole  point  of make these the base commandment be that they  aren't  reducible to rule . a set of rule be a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act . such thing can be very helpful to individual or society -- but not if they be use  instead  of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's action . the Great Commandment be , more than anything else , a call to act  as if you be God and accept ultimate responsibility  in your every action . a demand that I , like most , would rather  not  hear , but it keep pop up nonetheless ( along with the reassurance that it be more important that I be open to try this , than succeed at it ) . conservative may twist this act as if you be God to mean lay down rule for other people and be as nasty to they as possible if they don't keep your rule . they be so insistent ( and obvious ) about this that they have convince a lot of people ( who rightly reject the whole concept ! ) that such idiocy be how God act . that , after all , be the standard accusation against God by the atheist here and elsewhere . that the conservative have confuse their manipulative , hoop - jump notion of coerce other people with the Nature of God be almost the entire content of standard american atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point . and different body of Christians have , from the beginning , urge  different  ethical system ( or in some case , none ) . as a result , it be bizarre to identify any one of these system , however popular ( or infamous ) with Christianity . Christianity do not have a TORAH . it do not have a qu'ran . specifically christian scripture have very little , if anything , in the way of commandment -- so little that the Christians who desperately  want  commandment go mine for they with almost no support ( and thus almost no obvious limitation :-)) for their effort . the one , single , thing in the gospel which Jesus specifically give as a commandment to we be love one another . ti will be expand on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it be quite true that t some Christians infer lots of commandment from the NT- i'll t point out what have to be go on in these inference , and why t there be a huge amount of cultural baggage involve .  you be quite right that this be goo if one be look for an ethical system . but why should anyone be look for an ethical system , since our society be eager to hand we one or more no matter what we do ? it may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical system -- in which case I will profer the  agapate allelou  once again . I think you be beg the question . why don't I and the ( myriad of ) other Christians like I tell you something about Christianity ?  nor be this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origin and fundamental doctrine of the Quakers , from the 17th century onwards , and they be not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that be congenial to my case .

624;' first , you seem to assume all atheist think alike . an atheist do not believe in the existence of a god . our opinion on issue such as capital punishment and abortion , however , vary greatly . if you be attack the view of a particular atheist ( Benedikt , I presume ) , then please present your argument as such and do not lump we all together . as for the issue , let 's start with abortion . personally , I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception - after - the - fact . however , I support the right of any woman to have an abortion , regardless of what my personal view may be , because it would be arrogant of I to tell any individual what he  she may or may not do to his  her body , and the domain of legislator should not extend into the uterus . That be my opinion , and I be sure many atheist and theist would disagree with I . I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control , but I certainly defend it as an end to itself . I think most homosexual would be anger to hear of anyone characterize their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population level down . as for atheist believe all value be biological , I have no idea what you're talk about . finally , there be the issue of war and capital punishment . an atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might . you seem to be hang up on some suppose conspiratorial link between atheism and population control . could this be the atheist cause you be refer to a few post back ?

1046;' ( Book Review ): the UNIVERSE of MOTION , by Dewey B. Larson , 1984 , North Pacific Publishers , Portland , Oregon , 456 page , index , hardcover . the UNIVERSE of MOTION contain FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery . this book be Volume III of a revised and enlarge edition of the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE , 1959 . volume I be nothing but MOTION ( 1979 ) , and Volume II be the basic property of matter ( 1988 ) . Most book and journal article on the subject of astrophysic be bristle with integral , partial differential , and other FANCY MATHEMATICS . in this book , by contrast , mathematic be conspicuous by its absence , except for some relatively simple formula imbed in the text . Larson emphasize CONCEPTS and declare that mathematical agreement with a theory do not guarantee its conceptual validity . Dewey B. Larson be a retired engineer with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University . he develop the theory describe in his book while try to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY calculate the property of chemical compound base only on the element they contain . the UNIVERSE of MOTION describe the astrophysical portion of Larson 's CONSISTENT , INTEGRATED , COMPREHENSIVE , GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe , a kind of grand unified field theory that orthodox physicist and astro - physicist claim to be look for . it be build on two postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time : ( 1 ) the physical universe be compose ENTIRELY of one component , MOTION , exist in three dimension , in DISCRETE unit , and with two RECIPROCAL aspect , SPACE and TIME . ( 2 ) the physical universe conform to the relation of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematic , its primary magnitude be ABSOLUTE , and its geometry be EUCLIDEAN . from these two postulate , Larson be able to build a COMPLETE theoretical universe , from photon and subatomic particle to the giant elliptical galaxy , by combine the concept of INWARD and OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with translational , vibrational , rotational , and rotational- vibrational motion . at each step in the development , he be able to match part of his theoretical universe with corresponding part in the real physical universe , include even thing not yet discover . for example , in his 1959 book , he first predict the existence of explode galaxy , several year before astronomer start find they . they be a NECESSARY consequence of his comprehensive theory . and when quasar be discover , he have a relate explanation ready for those also . as a result of his theory , which he call the RECIPROCAL SYSTEM , Larson TOTALLY reject many of the sacred doctrine of orthodox physicist and astrophysicist , include black hole , neutron star , degenerate matter , quantum wave mechanic ( as apply to atomic structure ) , nuclear physics , general relativity , relativistic mass increase , relativistic Doppler shift , nuclear fusion in star , and the big bang , all of which he consider to be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL fantasy . he be very critical of the ad HOC assumption , uncertainty principle , solution in principle , no other way declaration , etc . , use to maintain they . the UNIVERSE of MOTION be divide into 31 chapter . it begin with a description of how galaxy be build from the gravitational attraction between globular star cluster , which be form from intergalactic gas and dust cloud that accumulate from the decay product of cosmic ray come in from the ANTI - matter HALF of the physical universe . ( galaxy formation from the MYTHICAL big bang be a big mystery to orthodox astronomer . ) he then go on to describe life cycle of star and how binary and multiple star system and solar system result from Type I supernova explosion of single star . several chapter be devoted to quasar which , accord to Larson , be densely - pack cluster of star that have be eject from the central bulge of explode galaxy and be actually travel faster than the speed of light ( although most of that speed be away from US in TIME ) . astronomer and astrophysicist who run up against observation that contradict their theory would find Larson 's explanation quite valuable if consider with an open MIND . for example , they use to believe that GAMMA RAY BURSTS originate from pulsar , which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy . but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observe that the burst come from all direction uniformly and do not correspond with any visible object , ( except for a few case of directional coincidence ) . Larson 's explanation be that the gamma ray burst originate from SUPERNOVA explosion in the ANTI - matter half of the physical universe , which Larson call the cosmic sector . because the anti - matter universe exist in a RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe , with the speed of light as the BOUNDARY between they , and have three dimension of time and only one dimension of space , the burst can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly at random . Larson heavily quote or paraphrase statement from book , journal article , and lead physicist and astronomer . in this book , 351 of they be superscripte with number identify entry in the reference list at the end of the book . for example , a quote from the book astronomy : the Cosmic Journey , by William K. Hartmann , say , our hope of understand all star would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple star form .... unfortunately we can not . Larson 's book contain LOGICAL consistent explanation of such mystery that be worthy of serious consideration by all physicist , astronomer , and astrophysicist . for more information , answer to your question , etc . , please consult my cited SOURCES ( Larson 's BOOKS ) . UN - altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this IMPORTANT Book Review be encouraged . ';2
335;' Mike Adams suggest discussion on long - term effect of spaceflight to the human being . I love this topic , as some of you regular know . so , having see Henry 's encouraging statement about start to talk about it- I shall . I feel that we as a community of people have unique resource to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate on the utility of spaceflight to field which be as divergent as medical intensive care , agriculture , environmental protection , and probably more . I do not believe that the general public understand the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society . in the absence of such knowledge , we see dwindle support of the world 's space effort . I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only communicate amongst ourselves , but also with other through print medium . a well - orchestrate and technically orient analysis of life science variable require to support long - duration spaceflight ( like long expendition to the moon or Mars ) would be entertaining and educational to the general public . the objective of such an effort would be to compile resource and publication from accept scientific and technical journal which would address each major life science area . in addition , idea for further research and development could be put forward for the general public to ponder ... allow the general public to take part in the excitement of exploration . individual interested should be willing to devote an hour per week to run literature search and find journal article . in addition , we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the hall of NASA and industry . I have appreciate the positive response to date and I be personally eager to start this project . perhaps we could start with debate regard how good to grade the viability of various technology for application to spaceflight .

I have an ehum , interesting experience with the Rosicrucians , or at least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday . they have advertise that they be hold a lecture title the Graal of the King -- the room of the heart ( which rhyme in Swedish ) . out of curiosity , I go to the lecture . there be four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians , one woman and two man apart from I . the Rosicrucians be male , both of they . first one of they tell we about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium Rosicrucianum , which be found in Harlem , NL in 1925 . he read straight from a piece of paper , which I at that point be because he lack experience in talk in front of people , but the other guy read , too , and he be use to hold speech , I could tell . the first guy also say that the r : s be a mystical christian order , and that they base their teaching on the teaching of the Kathars ( English ? ) from the thirteenth century . the other guy take over , read from his piece of paper in a fairy - tale teller 's voice . what he say sound like a load of crap to I . of course that might be because I be unenlightened or something . what make I a bit suspicious , be the way they first say that we all contain something divine , and could find our way back to divinity , then that we couldn't become divine as the person we be currently , but if we work really hard we would reach eternal bliss . maybe I've read too much raw , but it sound very much like the thing he talk about in the chapter  how to robotize people and brainwash your friend  in  Prometheus rise  . it be very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians . the one hold the actual lecture , obviously be top dog , and the other one seem to be a true believer . I get the impression that the top dog have more distance to the faith than the true believer , that he use it to gain power and admiration . he speak like a fairy - tale teller , whenever he remember . - ) the information brochure be at home . should you want their address , please e - mail I . --Ceci ';3
442;' perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics be . if we can't measure anything objectively , then the answer we get from physics aren't objective either . That be what I mean when I say there 's no objective physics . sure , we can all agree that ( say ) F  GMm  r2 , but that 's math . It 's only physics when you relate it to the real world , and if we can't do that objectively , we're stick . ( of course , this display my blatant bias towards apply science- but even theoretical physics get apply to model of real world situation , base on real world observation . ) It be an axiom that it 's invariant . but if the two of we measure it , we'll get different answer . yes , we call that experimental error , but it be not really error in the conventional sense- in fact , if you don't get any , that be an error :-) you could argue that the value of c be objective , to within  -  some value  . but i'd call that a rather odd usage of the word objective , and it open the way for statement like Murder be objectively wrong for all people , to within 1 of the total population .

380;'  Deletia- in case anybody hadn't notice , Frank and I be debate objective morality , and seemingly hit semantic .  it may be that , be a non - native English - speaker , I've misunderstand your usage of objective , and try to debate something you don't assert- my apology . I'm at a loss to imagine what you really do mean , though . wrong point . the age of the universe have no direct effect on humanity 's stick power , in the way the moral system of a society can have . I'm say the Universe have a real age , because I see evidence for it- cosmology , astronomy and so on . I say this age be independent of people 's opinion of it , because I know different people have a lot of different opinion in the matter , yet empirical test consistently seem to give roughly the same result . I can't see how it do that . put a creationist to the task of perform the test and calculation , see to it ( s)he make no blatant error in measure or calculate , and the result of the test will be the same . because logically consistent empirical test contradict their opinion . if those test be just my opinion , then their own test ( which would then be their opinion ) would contradict mine , even if we conduct say test in identical manner , no ? they don't , which I take as show these test have some validity beyond our opinion of they . map the activity of nerve and neural activity , if you mean physical pain . you have a sharp point , I'll give you that- but you still haven't give I a way to quantify morality . we agree . hypothesis , however , can change- I hold that there be no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these change could gravitate , but that they could be change in any way imaginable , produce different result suitable for different task or purpose . well and bad be ( almost ? ) always define in the context of a moral system . your prediction will  always  be correct ,  within   that   moral   system  . what you need now be an objective definition of good and bad- I wish you luck . Isn't that what  you're  do , when assume an objectively real morality ? besides , what  exactly  be provably wrong with my statement ? claim there be no objective morality be suddenly a positive claim ? besides , I think I  can  lend some credence to my claim- ponder different individual , both fully functional as human being and member of society , but yet with wildly different moral code . if morality be objective , at least one should be way off base , but yet hir 'incorrect ' morality seem to function fine . how come ? as for produce these individual , it might be easy to pick they from different societies- say , an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system , for example ( if such still exist ) .  deletia - testing for football on desk  one thing be good under some circumstance , because we wish to achieve some goal , for some reason . other time we wish to do something else , and that thing be no long so clearly good at all . some thing be hard to make good , because we'd seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into . still , the Aztecs be do fine until the Spaniards wipe they out . I almost always know what good means- sometimes I even know why . I never claim this good be thereby fix in stone , immutable .  ...  yes , I too , and I've try a thing or two down that line- it doesn't look good for objective value to I at all . ';0

250;' the HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelength that might cook the focal element , nor be its figure good on those scale -- the problem be that the antenna  itself  could not be expose to Venus - level sunlight , lest like Icarus ' wing it melt . ( I think it be glue and such , as well as electronic , that they be worried about . ) thus it have to remain furled and the axis  always  point near the sun , so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the fold HGA .

602;' well , I seem to have strike an interesting discussion off . give that I be not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist , i'll have to boil it down a bit . 1 ) all the datum on burst to date , show a smooth random distribution . 2 ) that mean they aren't concentrate in galactic core , our or someone else . 3 ) if the distribution be smooth , we be either see some enormously large phenomenon scatter at the edge of the universe say phenomenon be subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena tor we be see some phenomenon out at like the Oort cloud , but then it need some potent little energy source , that isn't detectable by any other current method . 4 ) we know it be not real close , like slightly extra solar , because we have no parallax measurement on the burst . 5 ) the burst seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impact or something like that . so everyone be watch the datum and argue like mad in the meanwhile . what I be wonder , be this in people 's opinion , a new Physics problem . Einstein get well know for solvingthe photoelectric effect . Copernicus , start look at irregularity in planetary motion . be this a big enough problem , to create a new area of physic ? just a little speculative thinking folk . ';2
1509;' the same way that any theory be prove false . you examine the predicition that the theory make , and try to observe they . if you don't , or if you observe thing that the theory predict wouldn't happen , then you have some evidence against the theory . if the theory can't be modify to incorporate the new observation , then you say that it be false . for example , people use to believe that the earth have be create 10,000 year ago . but , as evidence show that prediction from this theory be not true , it be abandon .
