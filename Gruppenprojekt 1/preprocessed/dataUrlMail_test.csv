This because there MUCH iron present- that related structure iron atoms atom building process, which Larson explains some books [better than can]. When star explodes, lighter material outer portion star blown outward space less than speed light. heavier material center portion star already bouncing around close speed light, because high temperature. explosion pushes that material OVER speed light, expands OUTWARD TIME, which equivalent INWARD SPACE, often actually DISAPPEARS while. Over long periods time, both masses start fall back gravitationally. material that been blown outward space starts form GIANT star. material that been blown OUTWARD TIME starts form WHITE DWARF star.

G-losses component rocket thrust vertical direction counter gravity, which contribute horizontal orbital velocity. Thus they represent wasted thrust. Together with drag, rockets starting from ground have 15\% velocity penalty contend with. This analysis simplified, that does consider wind loads. These will require more structural support over first miles height. Above that, pressure drops enough value factor. Dani Eder;2

1883;'Archive-name: atheism/introduction Alt-atheism-archive-name: introduction Last-modified: April 1993 Version: -----BEGIN SIGNED MESSAGE----- Introduction Atheism mathew <> This article attempts provide general introduction atheism. Whilst have tried neutral possible regarding contentious issues, should always remember that this document represents only viewpoint. would encourage read widely draw your conclusions- some relevant books listed companion article. provide sense cohesion progression, have presented this article imaginary conversation between atheist theist. questions asked imaginary theist questions which have been cropped repeatedly alt.atheism since newsgroup created. Some other frequently asked questions answered companion article. Please note that this article arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from Christian viewpoint. This because files reflect questions which have actually been asked, predominantly Christians proselytize alt.atheism. when talk religion, talking primarily about religions such Christianity, Judaism Islam, which involve some sort superhuman divine being. Much discussion will apply other religions, some not. What atheism? Atheism characterized absence belief existence God. Some atheists further, believe that does exist. former often referred weak atheist position, latter strong atheism. important note difference between these positions. Weak atheism simple scepticism- disbelief existence God. Strong atheism positive belief that does exist. Please fall into trap assuming that atheists strong atheists. Some atheists believe non-existence Gods- others limit their atheism specific Gods, such Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials. isn\'t disbelieving same thing believing doesn\'t exist? Definitely not. Disbelief proposition means that does believe true. believing that something true equivalent believing that false- simply have idea whether true not. Which brings agnosticism. What agnosticism then? term \'agnosticism\' coined Professor Huxley meeting Metaphysical Society 1876. defined agnostic someone disclaimed (strong) atheism believed that ultimate origin things must some cause unknown unknowable. Thus agnostic someone believes that cannot know sure whether exists. Words slippery things, language inexact. Beware assuming that work someone\'s philosophical point view simply from fact that calls herself atheist agnostic. example, many people agnosticism mean weak atheism, word atheism only when referring strong atheism. Beware also that because word atheist many shades meaning, very difficult generalize about atheists. About sure that atheists don\'t believe God. example, certainly isn\'t case that atheists believe that science best find about universe. what philosophical justification basis atheism? There many philosophical justifications atheism. find particular person chooses atheist, it\'s best her. Many atheists feel that idea presented major religions essentially self-contradictory, that logically impossible that such could exist. Others atheists through scepticism, because they evidence that exists. isn\'t impossible prove non-existence something? There many counter-examples such statement. example, quite simple prove that there does exist prime number larger than other prime numbers. course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules. Whether Gods universes similarly well-defined matter debate. However, assuming moment that existence provably impossible, there still subtle reasons assuming non-existence God. assume that something does exist, always possible show that this assumption invalid finding single counter-example. other hand assume that something does exist, thing question provably impossible, showing that assumption invalid require exhaustive search possible places where such thing might found, show that isn\'t there. Such exhaustive search often impractical impossible. There such problem with largest primes, because prove that they don\'t exist. Therefore generally accepted that must assume things exist unless have evidence that they Even theists follow this rule most time- they don\'t believe unicorns, even though they can\'t conclusively prove that unicorns exist anywhere. assume that exists make assumption which probably cannot tested. cannot make exhaustive search everywhere might prove that doesn\'t exist anywhere. sceptical atheist assumes default that does exist, since that assumption test. Those profess strong atheism usually claim that sort exists- instead, they generally restrict their claims cover varieties described followers various religions. whilst impossible prove conclusively that exists, possible prove that (say) described particular religious book does exist. even possible prove that described present-day religion exists. practice, believing that described religion exists very close believing that exists. However, sufficiently different that counter-arguments based impossibility disproving every kind really applicable. what essentially non-detectable? interacts with universe way, effects interaction must measurable. Hence interaction with universe must detectable. essentially non-detectable, must therefore case that does interact with universe way. Many atheists would argue that does interact with universe all, importance whether exists not. Bible believed, easily detectable Israelites. Surely should still detectable today? Note that demanding that interact scientifically verifiable, physical way. must surely possible perceive some effect caused presence, though- otherwise, distinguish from other things that don\'t exist? think there\'s philosophical justification atheism, isn\'t still religious belief? most common pastimes philosophical discussion redefinition game. cynical view this game follows: Person begins making contentious statement. When person points that can\'t true, person gradually re-defines words used statement until arrives something person prepared accept. then records statement, along with fact that person agreed continues. Eventually uses statement agreed fact, uses original definitions words rather than obscure redefinitions originally needed agree Rather than seen apparently inconsistent, will tend play along. point this digression that answer question Isn\'t atheism religious belief? depends crucially upon what meant religious. Religion generally characterized belief superhuman controlling power especially some sort faith worship. It\'s worth pointing passing that some varieties Buddhism religion according such definition. Atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power, categorized worship meaningful sense. Widening definition religious encompass atheism tends result many other aspects human behaviour suddenly becoming classed religious well such science, politics, watching it\'s religion. surely belief atheism science) still just faith, like religion Firstly, it\'s entirely clear that sceptical atheism something actually believes Secondly, necessary adopt number core beliefs assumptions make some sort sense sensory data experience. Most atheists adopt core beliefs possible- even those subject questioning experience throws them into doubt. Science number core assumptions. example, generally assumed that laws physics same observers. These sort core assumptions atheists make. such basic ideas called acts faith, then almost everything know must said based acts faith, term loses meaning. Faith more often used refer complete, certain belief something. According such definition, atheism science certainly acts faith. course, individual atheists scientists dogmatic religious followers when claiming that something certain. This general tendency, however- there many atheists would reluctant state with certainty that universe exists. Faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn\'t that definition, sceptical atheism beliefs. Strong atheism closer, still doesn\'t really match, even most dogmatic atheist will tend refer experimental data lack when asserting that does exist. atheism religious, surely it\'s anti-religious? unfortunate human tendency label everyone either against, friend enemy. truth clear-cut. Atheism position that runs logically counter theism- that sense, said anti-religion. However, when religious believers speak atheists being anti-religious they usually mean that atheists have some sort antipathy hatred towards theists. This categorization atheists hostile towards religion quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists fact cover broad spectrum. Most atheists take live live attitude. Unless questioned, they will usually mention their atheism, except perhaps close friends. course, this part because atheism socially acceptable many countries. atheists quite anti-religious, even convert others when possible. Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact society outside Eastern Bloc countries. digress slightly: Soviet Union originally dedicated separation church state, just like USA. Soviet citizens were legally free worship they wished. institution state atheism came about when Stalin took control Soviet Union tried destroy churches order gain complete power over population.) Some atheists quite vocal about their beliefs, only where they religion encroaching matters which business example, government USA. Such individuals usually concerned that church state should remain separate. don\'t allow religion have running state, surely that\'s same state atheism? principle separation church state that state shall legislate concerning matters religious belief. particular, means only that state cannot promote religion expense another, also that cannot promote belief which religious nature. Religions still have discussion purely secular matters. example, religious believers have historically been responsible encouraging many political reforms. Even today, many organizations campaigning increase spending foreign founded religious campaigns. long they campaign concerning secular matters, long they discriminate religious grounds, most atheists quite happy them have their say. What about prayer schools? there\'s God, care people pray? Because people pray voters lawmakers, tend things that those don\'t pray can\'t just ignore. Also, Christian prayer schools intimidating non-Christians, even they told that they need join diversity religious non-religious belief means that impossible formulate meaningful prayer that will acceptable those present public event. Also, non-prayers tend have friends family pray. reasonable care about friends family wasting their time, even without other motives. mentioned Christians campaign increased foreign aid. What about atheists? aren\'t there atheist charities hospitals? Don\'t atheists object religious charities? There many charities without religious purpose that atheists contribute Some atheists contribute religious charities well, sake practical good they Some atheists even voluntary work charities founded theistic basis. Most atheists seem feel that atheism isn\'t worth shouting about connection with charity. them, atheism just simple, obvious everyday matter, charity. Many feel that it\'s somewhat cheap, self-righteous, simple charity excuse plug particular religious beliefs. weak atheists, building hospital believe rather strange idea- it\'s rather like holding party Today birthday. fuss? Atheism rarely evangelical. said atheism isn\'t anti-religious. perhaps backlash against one\'s upbringing, rebelling? Perhaps some. many people have parents attempt force religious atheist) ideas upon them, many those people choose call themselves atheists. It\'s also doubtless case that some religious people chose religion backlash against atheist upbringing, being different. other hand, many people choose religion conforming expectations others. whole, can\'t conclude much about whether atheism religion backlash conformism- although general, people have tendency along with group rather than think independently. atheists differ from religious people? They don\'t believe God. That\'s there Atheists listen heavy metal backwards, even they prefer Verdi Requiem, even they know words. They wear Hawaiian shirts, they dress black, they even wear orange robes. (Many Buddhists lack belief sort God.) Some atheists even carry copy Bible around arguing against, course! Whoever are, chances have several atheists without realising Atheists usually unexceptional behaviour appearance. Unexceptional? aren\'t atheists less moral than religious people? That depends. define morality obedience God, then course atheists less moral they don\'t obey God. usually when talks morality, talks what acceptable (right) unacceptable (wrong) behaviour within society. Humans social animals, maximally successful they must co-operate with each other. This good enough reason discourage most atheists from anti-social immoral behaviour, purely purposes self-preservation. Many atheists behave moral compassionate simply because they feel natural tendency empathize with other humans. they care what happens others? They don\'t know, they simply that way. Naturally, there some people behave immorally atheism justify their actions. However, there equally many people behave immorally then religious beliefs justify their actions. example: Here trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ came into world save sinners... that very reason, shown mercy that me... Jesus Christ might display unlimited patience example those would believe receive eternal life. king eternal, immortal, invisible, only God, honor glory forever ever. above quote from statement made court February 17th 1992 Jeffrey Dahmer, notorious cannibal serial killer Milwaukee, Wisconsin. seems that every atheist mass-murderer, there religious mass-murderer. what more trivial morality? survey conducted Roper Organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences. While only respondents said they driven intoxicated before being born again, 12\% done after conversion. Similarly, used illegal drugs before conversion, after. percent admitted engaging illicit before salvation- after. [Freethought Today, September 1991, 12.] seems that best, religion does have monopoly moral behaviour. there such thing atheist morality? mean there such thing morality atheists?, then answer yes, explained above. Many atheists have ideas about morality which least strong those held religious people. mean Does atheism have characteristic moral code?, then answer Atheism itself does imply anything much about person will behave. Most atheists follow many same moral rules theists, different reasons. Atheists view morality something created humans, according humans feel world \'ought\' work, rather than seeing rules decreed supernatural being. Then aren\'t atheists just theists denying God? study Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90\% atheists responded became atheists because religion work them. They found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them. Atheists unbelievers through ignorance denial- they unbelievers through choice. vast majority them have spent time studying more religions, sometimes very great depth. They have made careful considered decision reject religious beliefs. This decision may, course, inevitable consequence that individual\'s personality. naturally sceptical person, choice atheism often only that makes sense, hence only choice that person honestly make. don\'t atheists want believe God? Atheists live their lives though there nobody watching over them. Many them have desire watched over, matter good-natured Brother figure might Some atheists would like able believe what? Should believe things merely because wants them true? risks such approach should obvious. Atheists often decide that wanting believe something enough- there must evidence belief. course atheists evidence existence they unwilling their souls see! Many, most atheists were previously religious. been explained above, vast majority have seriously considered possibility that exists. Many atheists have spent time prayer trying reach God. course, true that some atheists lack open mind- assuming that atheists biased insincere offensive closed-minded. Comments such course there, just aren\'t looking properly likely viewed patronizing. Certainly, wish engage philosophical debate with atheists vital that give them benefit doubt assume that they being sincere they that they have searched God. willing believe that they basically telling truth, debate futile. Isn\'t whole life completely pointless atheist? Many atheists live purposeful life. They decide what they think gives meaning life, they pursue those goals. They make their lives count, wishing eternal life, having influence other people will live example, atheist dedicate life political reform, hope leaving mark history. natural human tendency look meaning purpose random events. However, means obvious that life sort thing that meaning. another way, everything which looks like question actually sensible thing ask. Some atheists believe that asking What meaning life? silly asking What meaning coffee?. They believe that life purpose meaning, just atheists find comfort time danger? There many ways obtaining comfort- from family, friends, even pets. less spiritual level, from food drink That sound rather empty vulnerable face danger, what? Should individuals believe things because they comforting, should they face reality matter harsh might end, it\'s decision individual concerned. Most atheists unable believe something they would otherwise believe merely because makes them feel comfortable. They truth before comfort, consider that searching truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\'s just hard luck. Don\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly shown wrong? short answer you? Many atheists have been atheists years. They have encountered many arguments much supposed evidence existence God, they have found invalid inconclusive. Thousands years religious belief haven\'t resulted good proof existence God. Atheists therefore tend feel that they unlikely proved wrong immediate future, they stop worrying about should theists question their beliefs? Don\'t same arguments apply? because beliefs being questioned similar. Weak atheism sceptical default position take- asserts nothing. Strong atheism negative belief. Theism very strong positive belief. Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because very real harm they cause just believers, everyone else. What sort harm? Religion represents huge financial work burden mankind. It\'s just matter religious believers wasting their money church buildings- think time effort spent building churches, praying, Imagine that effort could better spent. Many theists believe miracle healing. There have been plenty instances people being healed priest, ceasing take medicines prescribed them doctors, dying result. Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions religious grounds. arguable that Catholic Church\'s opposition birth control condoms particular increasing problem overpopulation many third-world countries contributing spread AIDS world-wide. Religious believers have been known murder their children rather than allow their children become atheists marry someone different religion. Those weren\'t REAL believers. They just claimed believers some sort excuse. What makes real believer? There many True Religions it\'s hard tell. Look Christianity: there many competing groups, convinced that they only true Christians. Sometimes they even fight kill each other. atheist supposed decide who\'s REAL Christian isn\'t, when even major Christian churches like Catholic Church Church England can\'t decide amongst themselves? end, most atheists take pragmatic view, decide that anyone calls himself Christian, uses Christian belief dogma justify actions, should considered Christian. Maybe some those Christians just perverting Christian teaching their ends surely Bible readily used support un-Christian acts can\'t much moral code? Bible word God, couldn\'t have made less easy misinterpret? know that your beliefs aren\'t perversion what your intended? there single unambiguous interpretation Bible, then should atheist take interpretation over another just your say-so? Sorry, someone claims that believes Jesus that murdered others because Jesus Bible told must call Christian. Obviously those extreme sorts beliefs should questioned. since nobody ever proved that does exist, must very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared faiths, nonsense. That does hold, because pointed start this dialogue, positive assertions concerning existence entities inherently much harder disprove than negative ones. Nobody ever proved that unicorns don\'t exist, that doesn\'t make unlikely that they myths. therefore much more valid hold negative assertion default than hold positive assertion default. course, weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing better still. Well, atheism\'s great, there many theists? Unfortunately, popularity belief little with correct whether works- consider many people believe astrology, graphology, other pseudo-sciences. Many atheists feel that simply human weakness want believe gods. Certainly many primitive human societies, religion allows people deal with phenomena that they adequately understand. course, there\'s more religion than that. industrialized world, find people believing religious explanations phenomena even when there perfectly adequate natural explanations. Religion have started means attempting explain world, nowadays serves other purposes well. many cultures have developed religions. Surely that must something? really. Most religions only superficially similar- example, it\'s worth remembering that religions such Buddhism Taoism lack sort concept Christian sense. course, most religions quick denounce competing religions, it\'s rather religion justify another. What about famous scientists philosophers have concluded that exists? every scientist philosopher believes god, there does not. Besides, already been pointed out, truth belief determined many people believe Also, important realize that atheists view famous scientists philosophers same that theists view their religious leaders. famous scientist only human- expert some fields, when talks about other matters words carry special weight. Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish speaking subjects which outside their fields expertise. really saying that widespread belief religion indicates nothing? entirely. certainly indicates that religion question properties which have helped spread far. theory memetics talks memes sets ideas which propagate themselves between human minds, analogy with genes. Some atheists view religions sets particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread encouraging their hosts convert others. Some memes avoid destruction discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, using peer pressure keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken. Some religious memes even encourage their hosts destroy hosts controlled other memes. course, memetic view there particular virtue associated with successful propagation meme. Religion good thing because number people believe more than disease good thing because number people have caught Even religion entirely true, least puts across important messages. What fundamental messages atheism? There many important ideas atheists promote. following just them- don\'t surprised ideas which also present some religions. There more moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules. especially sceptical positive claims. want your life have some sort meaning, it\'s find Search what true, even makes uncomfortable. Make most your life, it\'s probably only you\'ll have. It\'s good relying some external power change you- must change yourself. Just because something\'s popular doesn\'t mean it\'s good. must assume something, assume something it\'s easy test. Don\'t believe things just because want them true. finally (and most importantly): beliefs should open question.

Matthew Wiener () contributed section Voyager, section Sakigake obtained from ISAS material posted Yoshiro Yamada (). PLANETARY MISSIONS MARINER (VENUS, MARS, MERCURY FLYBYS ORBITERS) MARINER first U.S. attempt send spacecraft Venus, failed minutes after launch 1962. guidance instructions from ground stopped reaching rocket problem with antenna, onboard computer took control. However, there turned guidance software, rocket promptly went course, Range Safety Officer destroyed Although sometimes claimed have been incorrect FORTRAN statement, actually transcription error which (indicating smoothing) omitted from expression R-dot-bar (nth smoothed value derivative radius). This error software treat normal minor variations velocity they were serious, leading incorrect compensation. MARINER became first successful probe flyby Venus December 1962, returned information which confirmed that Venus very (800 degrees Fahrenheit, revised degrees world with cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily carbon dioxide (sulfuric acid later confirmed 1978). MARINER launched November 1964, lost when protective shroud failed eject craft placed into interplanetary space. Unable collect Sun\'s energy power from solar panels, probe soon died when batteries solar orbit. intended Mars flyby with MARINER MARINER sister probe MARINER reach Mars 1965 took first close-up images Martian surface all) flew planet. probe found cratered world with atmosphere much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that Mars dead world both geological biological sense. MARINER sent Venus 1967. reconfirmed data that planet collected five years earlier MARINER plus information that Venus\' atmospheric pressure surface least times that Earth\'s, equivalent being 3,300 feet under surface ocean. MARINER were sent Mars 1969 expanded upon work done MARINER four years earlier. However, they failed take away concept Mars dead planet, first made from basic measurements MARINER MARINER ended Atlantic Ocean 1971 when rocket launcher autopilot failed. MARINER sister probe MARINER became first craft orbit Mars 1971. returned information Planet that other probe done before, revealing huge volcanoes Martian surface, well giant canyon systems, evidence that water once flowed across planet. probe also took first detailed closeup images Mars\' small moons, Phobos Deimos. MARINER used Venus gravity assist Mercury 1974. probe return first close-up images Venusian atmosphere ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details cloud cover, plus fact that entire cloud system circles planet four Earth days. MARINER eventually made three flybys Mercury from 1974 1975 before running attitude control gas. probe revealed Mercury heavily cratered world with mass much greater than thought. This would seem indicate that Mercury iron core which makes percent entire planet. PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, SATURN FLYBYS ORBITERS) PIONEER through failed meet their main objective photograph Moon close-up they reach enough into space provide information area between Earth Moon, including data Allen radiation belts circling Earth. three craft failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER launched October 1958, PIONEER November PIONEER December PIONEER Moon probe which missed Moon became first U.S. spacecraft orbit 1959. PIONEER originally designed flyby Venus, mission scaled down instead studied interplanetary environment between Venus Earth 36.2 million kilometers 1960, record until MARINER PIONEER through were placed into solar orbit from 1965 1968: PIONEER still transmitting information this time. PIONEER (would have been number suffered launch failure 1969. PIONEER became first spacecraft flyby Jupiter 1973. PIONEER followed 1974, then went become first probe study Saturn 1979. Both vehicles should continue function through 1995 heading into interstellar space, first craft ever PIONEER Venus (1978) (also known PIONEER Venus Orbiter, PIONEER burned Venusian atmosphere October 1992. made first radar studies planet\'s surface probe. PIONEER Venus (also known PIONEER sent four small probes into atmosphere December 1978. main spacecraft burned high atmosphere, while four probes descended parachute towards surface. Though none were expected survive surface, probe make transmitted 67.5 minutes ground before batteries failed. RANGER (LUNAR LANDER IMPACT MISSIONS) RANGER were test probes RANGER lunar impact series. They were meant high Earth orbit testing 1961, rocket problems left them useless orbits which quickly decayed. RANGER launched January 1962, intended land instrument capsule surface Moon, problems during launch caused probe miss Moon head into solar orbit. RANGER take some images Moon flew camera unfortunately aimed deep space during attempt. RANGER launched April 1962, same purpose RANGER suffered technical problems enroute crashed lunar farside, first U.S. probe reach Moon, albeit without returning data. RANGER launched October 1962 similar RANGER lost solar panel battery power enroute eventually missed Moon drifted into solar orbit. RANGER through more modified lunar missions: They were send back live images lunar surface they headed towards impact with Moon. RANGER failed this objective 1964 when cameras operate. RANGER through performed well, becoming first U.S. lunar probes return thousands lunar images through 1965. LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY) LUNAR ORBITER through were designed orbit Moon image various sites being studied landing areas manned APOLLO missions 1969-1972. probes also contributed greatly understanding lunar surface features, particularly lunar farside. five probes series, launched from 1966 1967, were essentially successful their missions. They were first U.S. probes orbit Moon. were eventually crashed into lunar surface avoid interference with manned APOLLO missions. SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS) SURVEYOR series were designed primarily APOLLO lunar module could land surface Moon without sinking into soil (before this time, feared some that Moon covered great layers dust, which would support heavy landing vehicle). SURVEYOR successful proving that lunar surface strong enough hold spacecraft from 1966 1968. Only SURVEYOR were unsuccessful missions. rest became first U.S. probes soft land Moon, taking thousands images scooping soil analysis. APOLLO landed feet from SURVEYOR 1969 returned parts craft Earth. SURVEYOR last series, purely scientific mission which explored Tycho crater region 1968. VIKING (MARS ORBITERS LANDERS) VIKING launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida August 1975 TITAN 3E-CENTAUR rocket. probe went into Martian orbit June 1976, lander down western slopes Chryse Planitia July 1976. soon began programmed search Martian micro-organisms (there still debate whether probes found life there not), sent back incredible color panoramas surroundings. thing scientists learned that Mars\' pinkish color, dark blue they originally thought (the pink sunlight reflecting reddish dust particles thin atmosphere). lander down among field sand boulders stretching cameras could image. VIKING orbiter kept functioning until August 1980, when attitude-control propellant. lander switched into weather-reporting mode, where been hoped would keep functioning through 1994- after November 1982, errant command been sent lander accidentally telling shut down until further orders. Communication never regained again, despite engineers\' efforts through 1983. interesting side note: VIKING 1\'s lander been designated Thomas Mutch Memorial Station honor late leader lander imaging team. National Space Museum Washington, D.C. entrusted with safekeeping Mutch Station Plaque until attached lander manned expedition.

1411;DeCenso, spite requiring Scholarly opinion hanging Judas, rejects that scholarly opinion those scholars then rephrases those scholars opinion subject: Actually, further research Greek word apacgw, will find that does denote success. Those scholars indeed have excellent reason assume that suicide successful. pointed out, recently checked several Lexicons: \tGreek English Lexicon Testament, Louw Nida \tRobinson\'s Greek English Lexicon Testament \tGreek English Lexicon Testament, Grimm \tWord study Concordance, Tynsdale Greek English Lexicon Testament other early Christian Writings, Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \tThe Analytical Greek Lexicon, Perschbacher couple simply stated hanged oneself, couple were more explicit stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself hanging. couple also noted that meaning root words apacgw strangle, throttle choke (which pretty much invalidates suggested David Joslin that Judas hung upside down). best references though, Robinson\'s Greek English Lexicon Testament, only stated translation, gave both root words, literal translation, related greek words which same roots, also other presented specific examples word greek literature give further context). word apagchw root words: gchw strangle root, root word means literally away. This root words included words which denote transition. mean transition place (eg: greek word apagello means send message). also denote change state specifically change from life death. Robinson specifically makes comparison word apokteiuo, which means kill. literal meaning word apacgw means throttle, strangle way, implicitly denotes change life state (ie: away from life, death). while word apacgw does mean hang, specifically denotes death well. Thus Robinson quite specific when state that means hang oneself, one\'s life hanging. then notes apacgw Homers Odessy 19:230 denote context. presents that example apacgw being used explicitly mean suicide hanging. since there perfectly good word strangling, without added denotation death, insist that Bible written God, every word precicely correct, stuck with complete meaning apacgw (ie: Since word apacgw used, then death denoted result). way, note that DeCenso also presents example apacgw: Note DeCenso, say, Septuagint translation from Hebrew Greek, have shown original meaning Hebrew Hebrew died), thus whether simply echoed Greek. should also pointed that, regardless added died, correct translation would still apacgw, indeed from strangulation (redundant, correct). Further, have evidence that Septuagint repeatedly rewritten reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), such editing even necessarily executed Greeks. Thus sure that Septuagint stands, paragon ancient greek. what really need prove your point DeCenso, example, ancient greek, someone committing apacgw surviving. Otherwise would simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence. would note DeCenso, that everytime research your apparently contrived exegisis, pretty much find false. Thus, think that going text, something over above what source clearly says, then better have explicit Greek historical source justify way, Rose\'s statement about trees around Potter\'s Field: Unless Rose show that these trees thousand years old, that there 2000 year stumps there, thousand year description area which mentions such trees, then inappropriate assert that present placement trees prove location trees thousand years (after all, things change). your other argument, that money Judas used same silvers: True, Peter author Acts) does specifically call Judas\' betrayal iniquity, that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\' actions iniquity either. Further John 13:29 that Judas took Some thought that because, Judas money box, Jesus telling what need feast- that should give something poor, after receiving morsel immediately went out, night. Note that said that Judas left, does that took money box. Thus when your explanation still seems would choose unproven iniquity, mentioned another author, different book, written different time, over iniquity explicitly mentioned author acts. find this forced contrived. course this particular argument becomes moot, since have have seen evidence that apacgw means suicide. see, since Judas\' hanging successful, could have spent money mentioned John 13:29, because Matthew Mark explicitly betrayal high holy (ie: Passover), thus could have spent money before killing himself next day. Thus money which bought Field Blood would have have been pieces silver course pieces silver that night well, thus couldn\'t have spent that either. dear, believe that house cards comming down).

Today\'s (4/23) edition York Times reports that O\'Connor told panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such using giant external fuel tanks used launching space shuttles, building station around existing space shuttle with wings tail removed. Currently, there three options being considered, presented advisory panel meeting yesterday (and reported today\'s Times). Option Cost Modular Approach This option being studied team from MSFC. aside, there redesign teams MSFC, JSC, LaRC supporting (Station Redesign Team) Crystal City. Both LeRC Reston folks also on-site these locations, helping respective teams with their redesign activities.} features this option are: Uses Bus-1, modular developed Lockheed that\'s qualified ELV\'s. provides propulsion, GN&C Communications, Data Management. Lockheed developed this Force. Power Station Capability obtained Shuttle Flights. Solar arrays used provide power. vehicle flies arrow mode optimize microgravity environment. Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize vehilce power source missions. Human tended capability opposed sexist term man-tended capability) achieved addition Common module. This modified version existing module (docking ports added International Partners\' labs, taking place nodes SSF). Shuttle docked station missions. Orbiter would provide crew habitability capability. International Human Tended. NASDA modules, another power Permanent Human Presence Capability. power module, U.S. habitation module, ACRV (Assured Crew Return Vehicle). Option Space Station Freedom Derived Option team based LaRC, lead Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like existing design, which have come know love This option assumes lightweight external tank available assembly flights does option Also, number flights computed 51.6 inclination orbit, both options build-up occurs phases: Initial Research Capability reached after flights. Power transferred from vehicle Orbiter/Spacelab, when visits. Man-Tended Capability (Griffin adopted non-sexist language) achieved after flights. U.S. deployed, solar power module provides power. Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after flights, keeping Orbiter on-orbit ACRV sometimes there would Orbiters on-orbit ACRV, second that comes Logistics Re-supply). Fault Tolerance Capability achieved after flights, with addition power module, another thermal control system radiator, more propulsion modules. After flights, Internationals on-board. More power, Habitation module, ACRV added finish assembly flights. Most systems currently used as-is this option, with exception data management system, which major changes.';2

Let\'s consider some personal interpretations much trust should Orthodox Mormonism, which could never confused with Orthodox Christianity. attacks Christians, Mormon Apostle Bruce McConkie said they thrash around in...darkness trying identify Elohim Jehovah show their relationship promised Messiah. also said Christians wrong believe that Jehovah Supreme Deity [God Father], that Christ came into mortality Only Begotten Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today truth about matter. said that Elohim Father Jehovah Son. Being thus aware astray religious intellectualists have gone defining their three-in-one God, comes surprise learn that they thrash around same darkness trying identify Elohim Jehovah show their relationship promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah Supreme Deity whose came into mortality Only Begotten. with their concept that Spirit, this misinformation about Gods Heaven untrue. fact attested Holy Writ, that Elohim Father, that Jehovah born into mortality Lord Jesus Christ, promised Messiah. (Promised Messiah, 100) Notice that McConkie said Christians wrong about their three-in-one their belief that Spirit they their understanding Elohim Jehovah are. Before examining McConkie\'s attack validity, shall read more statements McConkie other Mormon sources concerning words Elohim Jehovah. McConkie stated: ...the chief designation Christ that been preserved Testament, that ancient work published, exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, 367) _Elohim_, plural word though also used exalted name-title Eternal Father, usage that connotes supremacy omnipotence, being above Gods. (Mormon Doctrine, 224) Agreeing with McConkie question Elohim Jehovah are, Apostle James Talmage stated: _Elohim_, understood used restored Church Jesus Christ, name-title Eternal Father, whose firstborn spirit _Jehovah_ Only Begotten flesh, Jesus Christ. (Jesus Christ, Doctrinal Exposition First Presidency Twelve apostles Mormon Church states that Eternal Father...[is] designate[d] exalted name-title \'Elohim\'... (Articles Faith, 466) ...Christ preexistent, antemortal, unembodied state...was known Jehovah... (Articles Faith, 471) Today Mormon leaders teach that Elohim refers Father Jehovah refers Christ. McConkie attacked Christians saying Jehovah refer Father. stressed that these name-titles should changed around that Christ called Elohim Father called Jehovah. ...the Father...is Elohim, Jehovah.... Jehovah Christ, Christ Jehovah- they same person. (Promised Messiah, 111) Bible, Hebrew word Elohim used refer true God, false gods goddesses, judges Israel. When referring true God, Elohim translated with capital When referring false gods goddesses judges Israel, translated with small translated four times judges (Exod. 21:6- 22:8-9), once judge Sam. 2:25), twice mighty (Gen. 23:6- Exod. 9:28), once angels (Ps. 8:5), once godly (Mal. 2:15), once great (Gen. 30:8), once very great. Sam. 14:15) word Jehovah traditional pronunciation tetragrammation YHWH YHVH with vowel points taken from word Adonai. Many people believe true pronunciation tetragrammation Yahweh Yahveh. However, since Jehovah rather than Yahweh word used Mormonism, this section will also Jehovah instead Yahweh examine validity claims Mormon leaders regarding that name. Jehovah, unlike Elohim, never used false gods. personal name triune Bible. KJV, Jehovah rendered primarily LORD, sometimes GOD, rarely Lord. that understand something about words Elohim Jehovah their Mormon leaders, shall consider Apostle McConkie\'s attack Christians believing Father Jehovah. trying prove that Jehovah refers exclusively Christ, McConkie cited several verses from Bible. Some these verses McConkie\'s interpretation them will examined whether right. Remember, McConkie said Father Jehovah- only Elohim. first example shall consider involves McConkie\'s interpretation 110:1. this verse stated: whom spake David when tongue touched Holy Spirit testified, Lord said unto Lord, thou right hand, until make thine enemies footstool? (Ps. 110:1.) Lords here involved: speaking other- greater than other- making provision triumph glory other. they what message contained this Messianic prophecy? What think Christ? Lord asked certain detractors toward mortal ministry. Whose Christ someone else? born divine Parent will other mortal mortal father? That descendant David matter great pride Jews. they answered, David. David\'s son? Truly was. more, much more. Lord, with irrefutable logic their complete discomfiture, asked, then doth David spirit call Lord, saying, Lord said unto Lord, thou right hand, till make thine enemies footstool? David then call Lord, son? That only David, that great King, acting under inspiration, calls Lord worships such? might add: _Who other Lord, spake unto David\'s Lord?_ there question Jesus interpreting words Psalm? saying that means: \'_The Father said unto Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, thou right hand, until after your mortal ministry- then will raise eternal glory exaltation with where will continue right hand forever.\' (Promised Messiah, 101-102) (emphasis added) Agreeing with above statement McConkie, following remark Mormon pamphlet _What Mormons Think Christ, reads: Lord [Elohim, Father] said unto Lord [Jehovah, Son]... (brackets original) McConkie clearly stated that Elohim Father speaking Jehovah this Psalm. However, when looks Hebrew word translated LORD, becomes apparent that either first LORD Father else Father Jehovah. Either McConkie wrong. Psalm reads: LORD [Jehovah] said unto Lord [Adon], thou right hand, until make thine enemies footstool. (Ps. 110:1) first LORD this verse Jehovah Mormonism says Christ, Father. second Lord Hebrew word Adon (singular Adonai, meaning master lord). first LORD Father second Lord Son, then Father Jehovah Adon. However, Father Jehovah McConkie claimed, then first LORD Jehovah Son, who, then, Adon? Obviously Father Jehovah this Psalm, Adon. Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated following: Lord have called thee righteousness, _Isaiah quoted Father saying Christ_, will hold thine hand, will keep thee, give thee covenant people, light Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, (emphasis added) McConkie said Father speaking Christ this passage which reads: LORD [Jehovah] have called thee righteousness, will hold thine hand, will keep thee, give thee covenant people, light Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6) According McConkie, LORD refers Father, thine thee refer Christ. However, LORD speaking Jehovah which means either McConkie wrong about speaking else Father Jehovah. Another example involves 22:7-8. these verses McConkie stated: shoot lip, they shake head, saying, trusted Lord that would deliver him: deliver him, seeing delighted him. (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, Jesus hung cross_, found these words: chief priests mocking him, with scribes elders, said, saved others- himself cannot save. King Israel, come down from cross, will believe him. trusted God- deliver now, will have him: said, God. thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast same teeth. (Matt. 27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, 530-531) (emphasis added) 22:7-8 reads follows: they that laugh scorn: they shoot lip, they shake head, saying, trusted LORD [Jehovah] that would deliver him: deliver him, seeing delighted him. McConkie said these verses their fulfillment Jesus hung cross. That means person scorned these verses Christ. Who, then, LORD whom trusted? Jehovah Father. Another example involves 31:13 41:9. Regarding them, McConkie stated following: With reference conniving conspiring plots incident Lord\'s arrest judicial trials prophecy was: They took counsel together against they devised take away life. (Ps. 31:13.) Mine familiar friend, whom trusted, which bread, hath lifted heel against (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised Messiah, 532) Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer Christ\'s arrest judicial trials. shall first consider then While McConkie only quoted verse verse will also included give complete understanding matter. have heard slander many: fear every side: while they took counsel together against they devised take away life. trusted thee, LORD [Jehovah]: said, Thou [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14) McConkie said verse referred Jesus Christ. Verse goes tell that (Christ) trusted LORD called Elohim. Mormonism teaches that above Jesus Elohim Father. Verse however, reveals that Elohim Jesus Jehovah Father. McConkie only quoted verse- however, verses will considered this examination. Yea, mine familiar friend, whom trusted, which bread, hath lifted heel against thou, LORD [Jehovah], merciful unto raise that requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10) McConkie stated above that verse referred Judas\' role Christ\'s death. Since Judas familiar friend lifted heel, pronouns mine, verse must refer Christ. Notice that beginning verse there change pronoun thou, which refers LORD (Jehovah). Then pronouns which refer Christ used again. That means Christ speaking Jehovah Father these verses. Another example involves McConkie\'s following remark about 110:4. great Messianic prophecies, spoken mouth David, ever after order Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah, 450) McConkie admitted this Messianic prophecy involving Christ. question What this verse refers Christ? LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, will repent, Thou priest ever after order Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4) Does LORD, which Jehovah, refer Christ? McConkie right Jesus Jehovah, Father not, then LORD would have refer Christ. who, then, addressed priest forever after order Melchizedek? Bible reveals that referred Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10- 6:20- therefore, LORD (Jehovah) 110:4 Father. Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. these verses McConkie stated: atoning sacrifice future Messiah, Isaiah said... _Lord_ laid iniquities all.... pleased _Lord_ bruise him... (Promised Messiah, 234) (emphasis added) McConkie rightly said these verses refer atoning sacrifice future Messiah. However, what failed mention that they also prove that Father Jehovah. Verse reads: like sheep have gone astray- have turned every way- LORD [Jehovah] hath laid [Christ] iniquity all, verse reads: pleased LORD [Jehovah] bruise [Christ]... Obviously LORD laid Christ iniquity bruised Father called Jehovah these verses. Remember, McConkie stated that some sectarians even believe that Jehovah Supreme Deity, that Christ came into mortality Only Begotten Son. called this concept misinformation that untrue. prove that McConkie misinformed believing untruth, Scriptural references Sam. 7:14- 2:7) will examined. McConkie stated following regarding these Scriptures: midst passage that clearly Messianic, Lord says Seed David: will father, shall son. Sam. 7:14.) second Psalm, whole which also clearly Messianic, occurs this statement: Thou Son- this have begotten thee. (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both these statements Hebrews says they prophecies that Christ would come God. (Promised Messiah, 143) McConkie cited Heb. show that Sam. 7:14 refer Christ would come God. Since McConkie first referenced Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with verse verses 11-13 will also included. since time that commanded judges over people Israel, have caused thee rest from thine enemies. Also LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that will make thee house. when days fulfilled, thou shalt sleep with fathers, will seed after thee, which shall proceed bowels, will establish kingdom. shall build house name, will stablish throne kingdom ever. will father, shall son. Sam. 7:11-14) These verses teach that LORD (Jehovah) would have Son, Messiah. second example McConkie cited 2:7. This examination will include verse Notice that LORD (Jehovah) says, Thou Son- this have begotten thee. will declare decree: LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto Thou Son- this have begotten thee. shall give thee heathen thine inheritance, uttermost parts earth possession. McConkie said these verses Scripture clearly Messianic, acknowledged they teach that Christ would come God. What willing acknowledge, however, that these Scriptures also teach that Father Jehovah that sectarians believe Jehovah Supreme Deity whose Jesus Christ, Only Begotten, right their belief. Another example involves Mic. 5:4. this verse McConkie stated following: truly, Lord _during mortal ministry! Truly, this whom written_: shall stand feed strength Lord, majesty name LORD God... shall great unto ends earth. (Mic. 5:4.) (Promised Messiah, 182) (emphasis added) According McConkie, pronoun beginning Mic. refers Christ during mortal ministry. Who, then, LORD God? Mic. reads: [Christ] shall stand feed strength LORD [Jehovah], majesty name LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim]... shall great unto ends earth. Obviously LORD Jesus Christ Jehovah Father referred Jehovah Elohim. Another example involves Isa. 61:1. these verses McConkie stated following: number Messianic passages speak Lord, and...his anointed (Ps. 2:2), signifying that Chosen consecrated apart ministry mission that his. _Jesus applied these passages himself_ quoting Isaiah\'s prophecy. Lord hath anointed preach good tidings unto meek (Isa. 61:1), then saying: This this scripture fulfilled your ears (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, 182-183) (emphasis added) first source McConkie quoted reads follows: kings earth themselves, rulers take counsel together, against LORD [Jehovah], against anointed. McConkie said anointed Christ. that true, Jehovah? Jehovah always Christ, anointed one? Obviously Jehovah referring Father anointed indeed referring Christ. second source McConkie cited Isa. 61:1 which states: Spirit Lord [Adonai] [Jehovah] upon because LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed preach good tidings unto meek- hath sent bind brokenhearted, proclaim liberty captives, opening prison them that bound- anointed preach, bind proclaim, open Jesus Christ. Who, then, anointed Him? This verse says LORD (Jehovah) anointing. Again, face same problem. Jehovah does refer Father, only Christ, then Jesus anointed someone, who? McConkie pointed out, Jesus applied these passages himself. Therefore, Jehovah anointed Christ Father. Other examples could cited show that McConkie other Mormon leaders wrong when they Father Jehovah. However, these should enough expose their error. Now, what about Mormonism\'s claim that Jesus Jehovah, Elohim? true that Jesus Jehovah. following Scriptures prove this fact: Thus saith LORD [Jehovah] King Israel, redeemer LORD [Jehovah] hosts- first, last- beside there God. (Isa. 44:6) [Jesus said] ...I first last: that liveth, dead... (Rev. 1:17-18) ...saith LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon whom they have pierced, they shall mourn him, mourneth only son... (Zech. 12:1,10) Behold, [Christ] cometh with clouds- every shall him, they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7) ...I LORD [Jehovah] God, Holy Israel... (Isa. 43:3) ...Ye denied Holy [Christ] Just... (Acts 3:14) shall come pass that whosoever shall call name LORD [Jehovah] shall delivered... (Joel 2:32) ...the name Jesus Christ Nazareth...there none other name under heaven given among men, whereby must saved. (Acts 4:10,12) Behold, Lord [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his reward with him... (Isa. 40:10) ...Behold, [Christ] come quickly- reward with me... (Rev. 22:12) ...the LORD [Jehovah] shall come, saints with thee. (Zech. 14:5) ...at coming Lord Jesus Christ with saints. Thess. 3:13) LORD [Jehovah] shepherd... (Ps. 23:1) [Jesus said] good shepherd... (John 10:14) ...saith Lord [Jehovah]. will seek that which lost... (Ezek. 34:15-16) ...the come seek save that which lost. (Luke 19:10) LORD [Jehovah] God, Holy Israel, Saviour... (Isa. 43:3) Looking that blessed hope, glorious appearing great Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. also Jer. 42:5 Rev. 1:5- Mal. Heb. 13:8- Kin. 8:28,39 John 2:24-25- Isa. 25:8 Tim. 1:10- 107:24,29 Matt. 8:26- Prov.3:12 Rev. 3:19) While Mormons right when they Jesus Jehovah, they wrong when they Elohim. Bible reveals that Jehovah only true Elohim there others false. Remember, Jehovah personal name triune revealed Himself Bible. Before consider Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah Elohim separate gods Mormons claims first note that only both Father Christ addressed Jehovah Elohim Holy Spirit. Whereof _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ covenant that will make with them after those days, saith Lord, will laws into their hearts, their minds will write them- their sins iniquities will remember more. (Heb. 10:15-17) (emphasis Holy Ghost said added) Behold, days come, _saith LORD_ [Jehovah], that will make covenant with house Israel, with house Judah... will their inward parts, write their hearts- will their [Elohim], they shall people.... will forgive their iniquity, will remember their more. (Jer. 31:31,33-34) (emphasis added) prophecy came time will man: holy spake they were moved _Holy Ghost_. Pet. 1:21) (emphasis Holy Ghost added) Spirit LORD [Jehovah] spake word tongue. Sam. 23:2. also Heb. 3:7-11 with 95:6-11) continue with Biblical quotes which show that Jehovah Elohim separate gods Mormons claim. when LORD [Jehovah] that [Moses] turned aside see, [Elohim] called unto midst bush, said, Moses, Moses. said, Here I.... [Bruce McConkie acknowledged that Christ\'s voice that spoke Moses burning bush... Promised Messiah, 394] LORD [Jehovah] said... Moses said unto [Elohim], Behold, when come unto children Israel, shall unto them, [Elohim] your fathers hath sent unto you- they shall What name? what shall unto them? [Elohim] said unto Moses, THAT said, Thus shalt thou unto children Israel, hath sent unto you. [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou unto children Israel, LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim] your fathers, [Elohim] Abraham, [Elohim] Isaac, [Elohim] Jacob, hath sent unto you: this name ever, this memorial unto generations. (Exod. 3:4,7,13-15) [Elohim] spake unto Moses, said unto him, LORD [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2) LORD [Jehovah], there none else, there [Elohim] beside girded thee, though thou hast known (Isa. 45:5) LORD [Jehovah] true [Elohim], living [Elohim], everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10) Thus saith LORD [Jehovah] King Israel, redeemer LORD [Jehovah] hosts- first, last- beside there [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6) Therefore will cause into captivity beyond Damascus, saith LORD [Jehovah], whose name [Elohim] hosts. (Amos 5:27) Behold, heaven heaven heavens LORD\'s [Jehovah\'s] [Elohim], earth also, with that therein (Deut. 10:14) Wherefore thou great, LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim]: there none like thee, neither there [Elohim] beside thee, according that have heard with ears. Sam. 7:22) said unto them, Hebrew- fear LORD [Jehovah], [Elohim] heaven, which hath made land. (Jon. 1:9) [Elohim] save LORD [Jehovah]? rock save [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31) Blessed nation whose [Elohim] LORD [Jehovah]... (Ps. 33:12. also 144:15) Hast thou known? hast thou heard, that everlasting [Elohim], LORD [Jehovah], Creator ends earth, fainteth not, neither weary? there searching understanding. (Isa. 40:28) mighty [Elohim], even LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, called earth from rising unto going down thereof. (Ps. 50:1) Sing unto [Elohim], sing praises name: estol that rideth upon heavens name JAH, rejoice before him. (Ps. 68:4) [Regarding word Jah, Bruce McConkie stated: (Hebrew Yah) contracted form Jehovah, Jahveh, Yahweh which names have reference Christ, Israel. Mormon Doctrine, 391] David arose, went with people that were with from Baale Judah, bring from thence [Elohim], whose name called name LORD [Jehovah] hosts that dwelleth between cherubims. Sam. 6:2) ...the Great Mighty [Elohim], LORD [Jehovah] hosts, name. (Jer. 32:18) [Elohim], make them like wheel- stubble before wind.... Fill their faces with shame- that they seek name, LORD [Jehovah].... That know that thou, whose name alone JEHOVAH, most high over earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18) Bible clearly teaches that Jehovah Elohim. fact, only Elohim there true, living, mighty, great, everlasting Elohim. Elohim Israel, kingdoms earth, heavens. Creator made heavens their host earth that dwell thereon. Jehovah\'s name Elohim hosts. (Amos 5:27) only Jehovah, Elohim, Elohim Jehovah. Bible reveals that Elohim\'s name (Ps. 68:4), Jehovah (Ps. 83:18), Jehovah hosts. Sam. 6:2- Jer. 32:18) nation whose Elohim Jehovah blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this Jehovah Elohim Mormons. Another Mormon error regarding Elohim Jehovah belief that Elohim, Jehovah, Father spirits, including Jesus. Articles Faith Apostle James Talmage, Doctrinal Exposition First Presidency Twelve apostles states that Eternal Father...\'Elohim,\' literal Parent of...the spirits human race. 466) This Doctrinal Exposition also states explicitly that Jesus Christ Father spirits have taken shall take bodies upon this earth, them. Son, they sons daughters Elohim. 473) Apostle Talmage stated that _Elohim_...is name-title Eternal Father, whose firstborn spirit _Jehovah_-- (Jesus Christ, Apostle Bruce McConkie stated following about this matter: ...Jehovah-Christ...did fact create earth forms plant animal life face thereof. _But when came placing earth, there change Creators_. That Father himself became personally involved. things were created Son, using power delegated Father, except man. spirit again flesh, created Father_. There delegation authority where crowning creature creation concerned. (Promised Messiah, (emphasis added) Mormon leaders claim that Jehovah-Christ create either man\'s spirit body. They maintain that Mormon Elohim, father, created both spirit body. Bible reveals truth about created man. Moses spake unto LORD [Jehovah], saying, LORD [Jehovah], [Elohim] _spirits flesh_, over congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. also 16:20-23) (emphasis added) ...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth heavens, layeth foundation earth, _formeth spirit within him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added) ...the LORD [Jehovah]...made this soul... (Jer. 38:16) will contend ever, neither will always wroth: spirit should fail before _souls which have made_.... ...saith LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis souls...I have made added) Behold, LORD [Jehovah], [Elohim] flesh_... (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added) Thus saith LORD [Jehovah], redeemer, that _formed thee from womb_. LORD [Jehovah] that maketh things... (Isa. 44:24) (emphasis added) Thus saith LORD [Jehovah]... have made earth, _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12) (emphasis added) ...God [Elohim] created upon earth... Unto thee shewed, that thou mightest know that LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim]- there none else beside him. (Deut. 4:32,35) Thus saith [El] LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth earth, that which cometh that giveth breath unto people upon spirit them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5) ...Thus saith LORD [Jehovah] hosts, [Elohim] Israel... have made earth, _the man_ beast that upon ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added) Bible reveals that Jehovah Elohim spirits flesh flesh itself, that formed spirit within him, that made this soul formed from womb. indeed create man. Mormon leaders right when they Jesus Jehovah, then they wrong when they create man. they right when they father created man, then they wrong when they Jehovah. Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus create man, Mormon scriptures teach that did. states following: Behold, Jesus Christ. Father Son.... never have showed myself unto _man whom have created_, never believed thou hast.... Behold, this body, which behold, body spirit- _man have created_ after body spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16) (emphasis added) that taketh upon sins world- that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added) ...the Abraham, Isaac, Jacob...is that same created heavens earth, things that them are. Behold created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added) D&C, 93:10 states that worlds were made [Christ]- _men were made him_- things were made him, through him, him. (emphasis added) Another error Bruce McConkie involving Jehovah creation belief that Jehovah many pre-mortal spirits helping create. Included this alleged group Joseph Smith, That [Christ] aided creation this earth many noble great spirit children Father evident from down, there space there, will take these materials, will make earth whereon these dwell. (Abra. 3:22-24.) Michael Adam these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Peter, James, John, Joseph Smith, many other noble great ones played part great creative enterprise. (Doctrines Salvation, vol. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, 169) Bible reveals truth about this matter: Thus saith LORD [Jehovah], redeemer, that formed thee from womb, LORD [Jehovah] that maketh things- that stretcheth forth heavens alone- that spreadeth abroad earth myself. (Isa. 44:24) Which alone spreadeth heavens, treadeth upon waves sea. (Job 9:8) Jehovah, Himself, created things. alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him. Regarding Mormon \'Elohim, Apostle McConkie stated: Elohim. plural word though also used exalted name-title Eternal Father, usage that connotes supremacy omnipotence, being above Gods. (Mormon Doctrine, 224) also stated that Jesus...is above save Father only. (Promised Messiah, 363) Bible states that above so-called gods triune Jehovah. LORD [Jehovah] great [El], great King above gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3) thou, LORD [Jehovah], high above earth: thou exalted above gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9) know that LORD [Jehovah] greater than gods [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. also 135:5- Deut. 10:17) Mormon leaders right when they Jehovah Elohim father, these verses from Bible would teaching that Mormon above father. However, McConkie clearly stated, Mormons believe Elohim father, Jehovah son, above Gods that Jesus above except father- Bible teaches that Jehovah above Elohim. Dev. March 1982, Bruce McConkie made following remark about praying Jesus: Another peril that those involved often begin pray directly Christ because some special friendship they feel been developed.... This plain sectarian nonsense. prayers addressed Father, only.... ...Perfect prayer addressed Father, name Son- uttered power Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With Lord, 19-20) McConkie states book Promised Messiah that Mormons pray Father, Son... same book McConkie states that Christ [the Son] Jehovah. This important remember, because although McConkie said prayer offered Mormon Christ Jehovah, Bible states repeatedly that people prayed Jehovah, only heard those prayers, accepted them valid requests. following small sample vast number times people prayed Jehovah. distress called upon LORD [Jehovah], cried unto [Elohim]: heard voice temple, came before him, even into ears. (Ps. 18:6) LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, have heard prayer supplication, that thou hast made before have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, name there ever- mine eyes mine heart shall there perpetually. Kin. 9:3) said unto Jeremiah prophet, Let, beseech thee, supplication accepted before thee, pray unto LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim], even this remnant... (Jer. 42:2) LORD [Jehovah], beseech thee, thine attentive prayer servant, prayer servants, desire fear name... (Neh. 1:11) that when Solomon made praying this prayer supplication unto LORD [Jehovah], arose from before altar LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling knees with hands spread heaven. Kin. 8:54) went therefore, shut door upon them twain, prayed unto LORD [Jehovah]. Kin. 4:33) Hezekiah, Thus saith LORD [Jehovah], [Elohim] David father, have heard prayer, have seen tears: behold, will unto days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5) acknowledge unto thee, mine iniquity have hid. said, will confess transgressions unto LORD [Jehovah]- thou forgavest iniquity sin. this shall every that godly pray unto thee time when thou mayest found... (Ps. 32:5-6) Notice above 32:6 that godly pray Jehovah. According McConkie other Mormon leaders, that Christ very whom McConkie said people should pray. Bible reveals there only true Elohim, name Jehovah. other Elohim false. They idols that cause their followers commit adultery against true Elohim idolatry. LORD [Jehovah] great, greatly praised: feared above gods [Elohim]. gods [Elohim] nations idols: LORD [Jehovah] made heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5) Thou shalt have other gods [Elohim] before (Exod. 20:3) know that LORD [Jehovah] greater than gods [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11) shall thou forget LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim], walk after other gods [Elohim], serve them, worship them, testify against this that shall surely perish. (Deut. 8:19) Thou shalt make covenant with them, with their gods [Elohim]. They shall dwell land, lest they make thee against thou serve their gods [Elohim], will surely snare unto thee. (Exod. 23:32- Take heed yourselves, that your heart deceived, turn aside, serve other gods [Elohim], worship them. (Deut. 11:16) That come among these nations, these that remain among you- neither make mention name their gods [Elohim], cause swear them, neither serve them, yourselves unto them. (Josh. 23:7) ...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] your hurt. (Jer. 7:6) LORD [Jehovah] true [Elohim], living [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10) they forsook LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim] their fathers, which brought them land Egypt, followed other gods [Elohim], gods [Elohim] people that were round about them, bowed themselves unto them, provoked LORD [Jehovah] anger. (Jud. 2:12) Shall make gods [Elohim] unto himself, they gods [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, will this once cause them know, will cause them know mine hand might- they shall know that name LORD [Jehovah]. Jer. 16:20-21) seem evil unto serve LORD [Jehovah], choose this whom will serve- whether gods [Elohim] which your fathers served that were other side flood, gods [Elohim] Amorites, whose land dwell: house, will serve LORD [Jehovah]. people answered said, [Elohim] forbid that should forsake LORD [Jehovah], serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh. 24:15-16) These verses teach that only true, living Elohim heaven earth Jehovah triune made heaven earth therein. Jehovah greater than Elohim, because other Elohim idols. reality behind them demonic. (Deut. 32:17) Jehovah Elohim given explicit warnings guidelines regarding these false Elohim. told people have Elohim Him. told people that they left false Elohim, those Elohim would snare them, they would hurt would perish. warned people take heed that their heart deceived into worshiping, serving, swearing making covenants with false Elohim. Jehovah Elohim told people would eventually judge false Elohim their followers. Despite these warnings guidelines, Elohim\'s covenant people forsook believed worshiped false Elohim\'s people they came contact with. 10:6 states that children Israel evil again sight LORD [Jehovah] served Baalim, Ashtaroth, gods [Elohim] Syria, gods [Elohim] Zidon, gods [Elohim] Moab, gods [Elohim] children Ammon, gods [Elohim] Philistines, forsook LORD [Jehovah], served him. This examination shown that Elohim Mormonism, like Elohim 10:6 true Jehovah Elohim. Therefore, people leave true Elohim Mormon Elohim will evil...in sight LORD [Jehovah]. Although McConkie attacked Christians their belief triune Spirit their belief that Father [Jehovah] sent into world, these beliefs true. triune- Spirit- Jehovah- send into world redeem mankind. obvious from this examination that Christians thrash around in...darkness about Elohim Jehovah are. wonders what Holy Writ McConkie mind when stated that attests fact that Elohim Father, that Jehovah Son. certainly mean Bible which teaches that Father, Son, Holy Spirit Jehovah Elohim. apparently mean either, because chapter 109, verses 1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer Father Jehovah. Summary Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\'s statement that Mormons have clear perfect understanding nature (Doctrines Salvation, 1:279) accurate. Mormon gods true Mormonism claims, idols which cause their followers commit adultery against idolatry. answer Jesus\' question, whom that Mormons Jesus someone different from Jesus revealed Bible whom apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting Mormon Jesus believing another Jesus whom Paul warned about. Bernard Brockbank, First Quorum Seventy, admitted 1977 issue Ensign, Mormon publication, that Mormon Jesus different from Christian Jesus. stated that true that many Christian churches worship different Jesus Christ than worshipped Mormons Church Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints. people believe Mormon Jesus committing adultery against idolatry. They have Son- therefore, they have Father, they have eternal life. Apostle Bruce McConkie rightly stated: Salvation comes only worshiping true God. (Promised Messiah, 163) McConkie also rightly stated that mere worship proper scriptural names does assure that worshiping true living God, because true names Deity applied false concepts God. (Mormon Doctrine, 270) Remember that Apostle Stephen Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave conception Godhead. (Contributions Joseph Smith, important people have left true triune revealed Bible repent return Him. They must forsake sins idolatry adultery which they committing Mormonism. ...all that forsake thee shall ashamed, they that depart from shall written earth, because they have forsaken LORD [Jehovah], fountain living waters. (Jer. 17:13) shall thou forget LORD [Jehovah] [Elohim], walk after other gods [Elohim], serve them, worship them, testify against this that shall surely perish. (Deut. 8:19) Thou shalt make covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32) ...Put away strange gods [Elohim] that among you, clean, change your garments. (Gen. 35:2) ...flee from idolatry. Cor. 10:14) necessary that Christians heed warnings Bible. they they will fall into sins adultery against idolatry. Remember, know only true eternal life. (John 17:3)';3

Larson\'s lack fancy PH.D. degree might reason that orthodox physicists ignoring him, VALID REASON. Sometimes takes relative outsider CLEARLY FOREST THROUGH TREES. same time, clear from books that also knew ORTHODOX physics astronomy well physicist astronomer, well enough point their CONTRADICTIONS, ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. Larson have funds, etc. experimentally test Theory. necessary simply compared various parts Theory with OTHER researchers\' experimental observational data. many cases, explanation BETTER. SELF-CONSISTENT Theory MUCH MORE than ORTHODOX physicists astronomers have! They CLAIM looking unified field theory that works, have been IGNORING over years now! Modern physics does explain physical universe well. Some parts some Larson\'s books FULL quotations leading orthodox physicists astronomers agree. remember that epicycles, crystal spheres, geocentricity, flat earth theory, etc., ALSO once SEEMED explain well, were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. Prof. Frank Meyer, Professor Emeritus UW-Superior, was/is STRONG PROPONENT Larson\'s Theory, still President Larson\'s organization, INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY UNIFIED SCIENCE, Editor their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY. moved Minneapolis after retiring. Super Collider BOONDOGGLE! AGAINST contruction Superconducting Super Collider, Texas anywhere else. would GROSS WASTE money, contribute almost NOTHING scientific value. Most physicists don\'t realize but, according comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory late Physicist Dewey Larson, described books, strange GOOFY particles (mesons, hyperons, ALLEGED quarks, etc.) which they finding EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, Cern, etc.) really just ATOMS ANTI-MATTER, which CREATED high-energy colliding beams, which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they incompatible with their environment. larger more expensive collider will ONLY create more elements anti-matter that physicists have seen there before, physicists will EVEN MORE CONFUSED THAN THEY NOW! more types anti-matter atoms worth $8.3 BILLION cost?!! Don\'t have much more important uses this WASTED money?! Another thing consider that primary proposed location Texas serious growing problem with some kind fire ants eating insulation underground cables. much POISONING ground ground water with insecticides will required keep ants Supercollider?! Naming Super Collider after Ronald Reagon, proposed, TOTALLY ABSURD! built, should named after leading particle PHYSICIST.

Larson\'s Theory, positron actually particle MATTER, anti-matter. When positron electron meet, rotational vibrations (charges) rotations their respective photons which they made) neutralize each other. Larson\'s Theory, ANTI-MATTER half physical universe THREE dimensions TIME, ONLY dimension space, exists RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP MATERIAL half. LARSONIAN Relativity perihelion point orbit planet Mercury been observed precisely measured ADVANCE rate seconds century. seconds this advance attributed calculations gravitational perturbations from other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, etc.). remaining seconds being used help prove Einstein\'s General Theory Relativity. late Physicist Dewey Larson achieved results CLOSER seconds than General Relativity can, INSTEAD using SPECIAL Relativity. more books, applied LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION HIGH ORBITAL SPEED Mercury. Larson TOTALLY REJECTED General Relativity another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY. also REJECTED most Special Relativity, including parts about mass increases near speed light, Lorentz Transform doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 1.000 REALLY MOVING FASTER THAN SPEED LIGHT, although most that motion away from TIME.). Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe, there THREE dimensions time instead only one. those dimensions measured from material half physical universe. dimension that measure CLOCK time. relative speeds, values other dimensions NEGLIGIBLE- high speeds, they become significant, Lorentz Transformation must used FUDGE FACTOR. [Larson often used term COORDINATE TIME when writing about this.] regard mass increases, been PROVEN atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near speed light. formula acceleration ACCELERATION FORCE MASS, F/m). Orthodox physicists IGNORING THIRD FACTOR: FORCE. Larson\'s Theory, mass STAYS CONSTANT FORCE drops toward zero. FORCE actually MOTION, COMBINATIONS MOTIONS, RELATIONS BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS. expansion universe, example, OUTward SCALAR motion inherent universe result so-called Bang (which another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY). UNIVERSE MOTION wish recommend EVERYONE book UNIVERSE MOTION, Dewey Larson, 1984, North Pacific Publishers, (P.O. 13255, Portland, Oregon 97213), pages, indexed, hardcover. contains Astrophysical portions GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe developed that author, UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. contains FINAL SOLUTIONS most Astrophysical mysteries, including FORMATION galaxies, binary multiple star systems, solar systems, TRUE ORIGIN 3-degree background radiation, cosmic rays, gamma- bursts, TRUE NATURE quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. contains what astronomers astrophysicists looking for, they ready seriously consider with OPEN MINDS! following example Theory\'s success: first book 1959, STRUCTURE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, Larson predicted existence EXPLODING GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them. They NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE Larson\'s comprehensive Theory. when QUASARS were discovered, immediate related explanation them also. GAMMA-RAY BURSTS Astro-physicists astronomers still scratching their heads about mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS. They were originally thought originate from neutron stars disc galaxy. Gamma Telescope Earth orbit been detecting them directions uniformly, their source locations space correspond known objects, (except cases directional coincidence). Gamma-ray bursts NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe developed late Physicist Dewey Larson. According page book UNIVERSE MOTION, published 1984, gamma-ray bursts coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS ANTI-MATTER HALF physical universe, which Larson calls Cosmic Sector. Because relationship between anti-matter material halves physical universe, they connected together, gamma-ray bursts into material half anywhere space, seemingly random. (This source locations bursts correspond with known objects, come from directions uniformly.) wonder close space source location would have gamma-ray burst kill most life Earth! There would predict one, stop Perhaps some MASS EXTINCTIONS past, which being blamed impacts comets asteroids, were actually caused nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation About half stars galaxy vicinity binary double. orthodox astronomers astrophysicists still have satisfactory theory about they form there many them. binary star systems actually LIKELY CONSEQUENCE comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe developed late Physicist Dewey Larson. will summarize Larsons explanation, which detailed Chapter book UNIVERSE MOTION some other books. First all, according Larson, stars generate energy fusion. small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse. rest results from COMPLETE ANNIHILATION HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON). Each element DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT. heavier element lower this limit. star\'s internal temperature increases grows mass accretion absorption decay products cosmic rays, gradually reaching destructive temperature limit lighter lighter elements. When internal temperature star reaches destructive temperature limit IRON, there Type SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION! This because there MUCH iron present- that related structure iron atoms atom building process, which Larson explains some books [better than can]. When star explodes, lighter material outer portion star blown outward space less than speed light. heavier material center portion star already bouncing around close speed light, because high temperature. explosion pushes that material OVER speed light, expands OUTWARD TIME, which equivalent INWARD SPACE, often actually DISAPPEARS while. Over long periods time, both masses start fall back gravitationally. material that been blown outward space starts form GIANT star. material that been blown OUTWARD TIME starts form WHITE DWARF star. BOTH stars then start moving back toward MAIN SEQUENCE from opposite directions Diagram. chances masses falling back into exact same location space, making single lone star again, near zero. They will instead form BINARY system, orbiting each other. According Larson, white dwarf star INVERSE DENSITY GRADIENT densest SURFACE), because material center most widely dispersed (blown outward) time. This ELIMINATES need resort MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about degenerate matter, neutron stars, black holes, etc.. LARSONIAN Solar System Formation mass heavy material center exploding star relatively SMALL, then, instead single white dwarf star, there will SEVERAL mini white dwarf stars (revolving around giant star, probably still away three-dimensional TIME affected heat, etc.). These will become PLANETS! Chapter UNIVERSE MOTION, Larson used this information, other principles comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe, derive version Bode\'s Law. Black Hole FANTASY! heard that physicist Stephen Hawking recently completed theoretical mathematical analysis black holes merging together into SINGLE black hole, concluded that black hole would have MORE MASS than original black holes. Such result should recognized EVERYone FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about whole IDEA black holes, etc.! After reading Physicist Dewey Larson\'s books about comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe, especially book UNIVERSE MOTION, clear that black holes NOTHING more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES! strange object Cygnus just unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, black hole that orthodox astronomers physicists badly want prove their theory. way, understand much publicity being given physicist Stephen Hawking. physicists astronomers seem acting Hawking\'s severe physical problem somehow makes wiser. does NOT! wish same attention been given Physicist Dewey Larson while still alive. Widespread publicity attention should given Larson\'s Theory, books, organization (The International Society Unified Science). ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION heard that concept many years ago, connection with UFO\'s unorthodox inventors, never able find they work, they constructed. found possible clue about they might work pages 112-113 book BASIC PROPERTIES MATTER, late Physicist Dewey Larson, which describes part Larson\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe. quote paragraph: indicated preceding chapter, development theory universe motion arrives totally different concept nature electrical resistance. electrons, find, derived from environment. brought Volume [Larson\'s book NOTHING MOTION] that there physical processes operation which produce electrons substantial quantities, that, although motions that constitute these electrons are, many cases, absorbed atomic structures, opportunities utilizing this type motion such structures limited. follows that there always large excess free electrons material sector [material half] universe, most which uncharged. this uncharged state electrons cannot move with respect extension space, because they inherently rotating units space, relation space space motion. open space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently same location with respect natural reference system, manner photon. context stationary spatial reference system uncharged electron, like photon, carried outward speed light progression natural reference system. material aggregates thus exposed flux electrons similar continual bombardment photons radiation. Meanwhile there other processes, discussed later, whereby electrons returned environment. electron population material aggregate such earth therefore stabilizes equilibrium level. Note that Larson\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons also massLESS, basically photons light particular frequency (above unit frequency) spinning around axis particular rate (below unit rate). (Unit velocity speed light, there vibrational rotational equivalents speed light, according Larson\'s Theory.) might have above below labels mixed up.] Larson saying that outer space filled with mass- LESS UN-charged electrons flying around speed light! this true, then ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION fields spacecraft might able interact with these electrons, other particles space, perhaps GIVING them charge (and mass) shooting them toward rear achieve propulsion. Larson\'s Theory, electrical charge one-dimensional rotational vibration particular frequency (above unit frequency) superimposed rotation particle.) paragraph quoted above might also give clue confused meteorologists about lightning generated clouds.

Better worse (almost?) always defined context moral system. Your prediction will _always_ correct, *within* *that* *moral* *system*. What need objective definition good bad- wish luck. Isn\'t that what _you\'re_ doing, when assuming objectively real morality? Besides, what _exactly_ provably wrong with statement? Claiming there objective morality suddenly positive claim? Besides, think _can_ lend some credence claim- ponder different individuals, both fully functional human beings members society, with wildly different moral codes. morality objective, least should base, \'incorrect\' morality seems function fine. come? producing these individuals, might easiest pick them from different societies- say, islamic some polynesian matrilineal system, example such still exist). deletia testing footballs desks thing good under some circumstances, because wish achieve some goal, some reason.

This makes difficult highly complex central brain coordinate movements very large creatures. there\'s little selection pressure such brains. Instead, simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\'t rule intelligent dinosaurs, points that direction. Then there thermodynamic arguments. tiny creature like lemur needs frequently because it\'s internal heat rapidly lost it\'s high surface volume ratio. contend that creature that must spend most it\'s time energy feeding won\'t have time develop exercise intelligence. That argument somewhat weak. dinosaur\'s problem reverse, must moderate it\'s heat production because it\'s high volume surface ratio makes tend retain waste heat.
