Most scattered solar system close encounters with Jupiter Saturn, many accreted into giants, especially Uranus Neptune. large planetesimal captured Neptune call Triton [captured how? Perhaps collision with smaller, already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps very close passage through Neptune\'s atmosphere mondo aerobraking!]. notes that recently discovered Kuiper Belt objects, 1992 1993 plus Chiron Pholus, about same mass, identifies this group one-accretion-down from larger bodies Triton Pluto/Charon. Pluto/Charon, thinks, formed when impacting body proto-Pluto, knocking some material into ring around Pluto which later accreted Charon- similar ideas about formation Earth\'s moon. There good evidence from spectra that surfaces Pluto Charon very different (Pluto methane frost, Charon doesn\'t), which used evidence impact theory. believes that there around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\'s orbit, beyond 1992 1993 first members this population found, model.

1082;here\'s least Christian\'s answer: Jesus JEW, Christian. this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes sense. Matt 5:17 think that [Jesus] came abolish Prophets- come abolish, fulfill. Jesus lived under Jewish law. However, culmination promises Prophets. came *fulfill* prophecies fully obey God\'s purposes. Verse says truly you, until heaven earth pass away, smallest letter stroke shall pass away from Law, until accomplished. this verse IMHO last phrase. Jesus, fulfillment law, accomplished what supposed accomplish. Verse Whoever then annuls least these commandments, teaches others, shall called least kingdom heaven- whoever keeps teaches them, shall called great kingdom heaven. Taken context Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under law, this makes sense. general, appears that Jesus responding some criticism must have received about doing away with Law. That Jesus\' intent all. come earth live should lived fulfill promises made people back [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your heel, *He* will bruise head.] Jesus appeared doing away with because honor traditions equal God. regularly locked horns with religious leaders because would conform *their* rules, only God\'s Law. Matthew passage Jesus defending dedication defending himself against accusors. Almost entire Sermon Mount (Matt. 5-7) dedicated helping Jewish people understand true intent Law, sweeping away clutter which been introduced Pharasees their traditions. Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes relationship Jesus this way: [23] before faith came, were kept custody under law, being shut faith which later revealed. [24] Therefore become tutor lead Christ, that justified faith. [25] that faith come, longer under tutor. [26] sons through faith Christ Jesus. believe this says that after Christ revealed, served it\'s purpose, i.e. tutor lead Christ, now, longer under tutor. been fulfilled Christ said would God, author Law, Christ/Man, Jesus, same personality. Therefore, Testament (the last will testament Jesus) based same moral principles. makes sense that many principles re-expressed Christianity. other hand, that fulfilled it\'s purpose Christians relate through Christ, Law, also makes sense that practices symbolisms were established represent mysteries this relationship. i.e. Baptism representing Christ\'s death, burial, resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8), Lord\'s supper memorial sacrifice Cor. 11:26), Sunday worship commemorating resurrection (Matt 28:1ff, Acts 20:7) That\'s Christian\'s explanation. don\'t claim have these issues completely settled even mind welcome other Christians offer other alternatives.

It\'s also entirely possible that Hitler lying when claimed believe God. certainly can\'t conclude that he\'s atheist, though. ------------------------------ Subject: Bible proves Typical posting: Bible says that... Response: Most readers alt.atheism feel that Bible questionable accuracy, written thousands years many authors were recording oral tradition that existed many years before. Thus, claimed \'truth\' questionable legitimacy. This isn\'t that Bible truth simply that truth must examined before being accepted. Many readers this group also feel that because passage subject interpretation, claim that passage \'means\' thing thing only legitimate. Note that this feeling tends extend other books. also remarkable many atheists that theists tend ignore other equally plausible religious books favour those their religion. ------------------------------ Subject: Pascal\'s Wager Typical posting: believe turn incorrect, have lost nothing don\'t believe turn incorrect, will hell. Therefore foolish atheist. Response: This argument known Pascal\'s Wager. several flaws. Firstly, does indicate which religion follow. Indeed, there many mutually exclusive contradictory religions there. This often described avoiding wrong hell problem. person follower religion religion Y\'s version hell. Secondly, statement that believe turn incorrect, have lost nothing true. Suppose you\'re believing wrong true might punish your foolishness. Consider also deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine favour prayer. Another flaw argument that based assumption that possibilities equally likely least, that they comparable likelihood. fact, possibility there being close zero, argument becomes much less persuasive. sadly argument only likely convince those believe already. Also, many feel that intellectually honest people, belief based evidence, with some amount intuition. matter will cost-benefit analysis. Formally speaking, argument consists four statements: does know whether exists. believing one\'s eternal soul does exist. Believing consequence does exist. Therefore one\'s interest believe God. There approaches argument. first view assumption, consequence problem with this approach, abstract, that creates information from information. This considered invalid information theory. Statement indicates information about statement indicates that beneficial information gained from absolute lack information about God. This violates information entropy information been extracted from information, cost. alternative approach claim that both assumptions. problem with this that then basically assumption which states Christian position, only Christian will agree with that assumption. argument thus collapses Christian, your interests believe rather vacuous tautology, Pascal intended argument viewed. biggest reason Pascal\'s wager failure that omniscient will certainly know really believes believes wager. will spurn latter... assuming actually cares whether people believe him. ------------------------------ Subject: What Occam\'s Razor?

There incredibly intricate complex universe there, there also created universe. Clearly this must non-zero complexity. Given that both explanations facts, Occam\'s Razor might suggest that should take simpler solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there third even more simple solution: There isn\'t incredibly intricate complex universe there. just imagine that there This third option leads logically towards solipsism, which many people find unacceptable. ------------------------------ Subject: it\'s good believe Jesus Typical posting: want tell people about virtues benefits religion.

Surely don\'t think this appeared here just chance? Response: This known Argument From Design. matter dispute whether there element design universe. Those believe that complexity diversity living creatures earth evidence creator best advised read newsgroup talk.origins while. There insufficient space summarize both sides that debate here. However, conclusion that there scientific evidence favour so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there much evidence, observation theory that explain many complexities universe life earth. origin Argument Design feeling that existence something incredibly intricate say, human improbable that surely can\'t have come about chance- that surely there must some external intelligence directing things that humans come from chaos deliberately. human intelligence improbable, surely existence mind capable fashioning entire universe complete with conscious beings must immeasurably more unlikely? approach used argue favour existence creator turned around applied Creationist position. This leads familiar theme creator created universe, what created creator?, with addition spiralling improbability. only declare that creator created just was). From here might well what wrong with saying that universe just without introducing creator? Indeed Stephen Hawking, book Brief History Time, explains theory that universe closed finite extent, with beginning end. Argument From Design often stated analogy, so-called Watchmaker Argument. asked imagine that found watch beach. Does assume that created watchmaker, that evolved naturally? course assumes watchmaker. like watch, universe intricate complex- argument goes, universe must have creator. Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over above those common Arguments Design. Firstly, watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas claimed have created universe from nothing. These sorts creation clearly fundamentally different, analogy therefore rather weak. Secondly, watchmaker makes watches, there many other things world. walked further along beach found nuclear reactor, wouldn\'t assume created watchmaker. argument would therefore suggest multitude creators, each responsible different part creation. Finally, first part watchmaker argument conclude that watch part nature because ordered, therefore stands from randomness nature. second part argument, start from position that universe obviously random, shows elements order. Watchmaker argument thus internally inconsistent. ------------------------------ Subject: Independent evidence that Bible true Typical posting: events Testament confirmed independent documentary evidence. example... Response: writings Josephus often mentioned independent documentary evidence. Early versions Josephus\'s work thought have mentioned Jesus James- extant version discusses John non-Christian context. Many scholars believe that original mentioned Jesus James passing, that this expanded Christian copyists. Several reconstructions original text have been published this effect. Much information appears Ecclesiastical History Eusebius (about C.E.). worthless historical material because deliberate falsification wily Eusebius generally acknowledged \'the first thoroughly dishonest historian antiquity.\' Eusebius generally given title authorship this material. Aside from Testament, biographical information about Jesus more well-documented. further information, please consult Frequently Asked Questions file newsgroup soc.religion.christian. ------------------------------ Subject: Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem Typical posting: Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that impossible Bible both true complete. Response: Godel\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that consistent formal system which sufficiently expressive that model ordinary arithmetic, formulate expressions which never proven valid invalid (\'true\' \'false\') within that formal system. (Technically speaking, system must also recursive- that there must decision procedure determining whether given string axiom within formal system.) Essentially, such systems formulate what known Liar Paradox. classic Liar Paradox sentence ordinary English This sentence false. Note that proposition undecidable, formal system cannot even deduce that undecidable. logic used theological discussions rarely well defined, claims that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that impossible prove disprove) existence worthless isolation. trivially define formal system which possible prove existence God, simply having existence stated axiom. This unlikely viewed atheists convincing proof, however. possible succeed producing formal system built axioms that both atheists theists agree with. then possible show that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds that system. However, that would still demonstrate that impossible prove that exists within system. Furthermore, certainly wouldn\'t tell anything about whether possible prove existence generally. Note also that these hypothetical formal systems tell nothing about actual existence God- formal systems just abstractions. Another frequent claim that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that religious text (the Bible, Book Mormon whatever) cannot both consistent universally applicable. Religious texts formal systems, such claims nonsense. ------------------------------ Subject: George Bush atheism patriotism Typical posting: George Bush really that atheists should considered citizens?

Here contradictions starting with trial continuing through assension. Acts 1:18: this (Judas) purchased field with reward iniquity- falling headlong, burst asunder midst, bowels gushed out. Matt. 27:5-7: (Judas) cast down pieces silver temple, departed, went hanged himself. chief priests...bought with them potter\'s field. Before cock crow Matthew 26:34 Before cock crow twice Mark 14:30 14:72 second time cock crew. Peter called mind word that Jesus said unto him, Before cock crow twice, thou shalt deny thrice. when thought thereon, wept. 26:74 Then began curse swear, saying, know man. immediately cock crew. 26:75 Peter remembered word Jesus, which said unto him, Before cock crow, thou shalt deny thrice. went out, wept bitterly. 22:60 Peter said, Man, know what thou sayest. immediately, while spake, cock crew. 22:61 Lord turned, looked upon Peter. Peter remembered word Lord, said unto him, Before cock crow, thou shalt deny thrice. 13:38 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou down life sake? Verily, verily, unto thee, cock shall crow, still thou hast denied thrice. 18:27 Peter then denied again: immediately cock crew. (This interesting because Matthew quotes prophesy that never made! only time does this either...) 27:9 Then fulfilled that which spoken Jeremy prophet, saying, they took thirty pieces silver, price that valued, whom they children Israel value- zechariah 11:11-13 (nothing Jeremiah remotely like) What color robe placed Jesus during trial? scarlet Matthew 27:28 purple John 19:2 Mark says third hour, a.m., John says sixth hour (noon) when sentence passed. Matthew This Jesus king Jews Mark\t King Jews Luke\t This king Jews John\t Jesus Nazareth king Jews vinegar Matthew 27:34 wine with myrrh Mark 15:23 Matthew said many stood off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary mother James, mother Zebedee\'s children. Mark Luke speak many off, Mark includes Mary Magdeline Mary mother James less. John says that Jesus\'s mother stood cross, along with sister Mary Magdalene. Matt.27:46,50: about ninth hour Jesus cried with loud voice, saying, Eli, eli, lama sabachthani? that say, God, God, hast thou forsaken ...Jesus, when cried again with loud voice, yielded ghost. Luke23:46: when Jesus cried with loud voice, said, Father, unto hands commend spirit: having said thus, gave ghost. John19:30: When Jesus therefore received vinegar, said, finished: bowed head, gave ghost. Matthew says that veil temple rent, that there earthquake, that dark from sixth ninth hour, that graves opened bodies saints arose went into Jeruselem, appearing many (beating Jesus resurection). Mark Luke speak darkness veil temple being rent mention earthquake risen saints. John only mentions Jesus\'s side being peirced. Matthew says Jews asked Pilate guard prevent body from being stolen disciples, tomb sealed. this supposedly done, other gospels mention these precautions. Depends where look- Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that will spend three days three nights heart earth, Mark 10:34 after three days (meta treis emeras) will rise again. from quick look, prophecies have after three days, post-resurrection narratives have third day. Matthew says Sunday dawn, Mark says rising, John says dark. 28:1 sabbath, began dawn toward first week, came Mary Magdalene other Mary sepulchre. 16:1 when sabbath past, Mary Magdalene, Mary mother James, Salome, bought sweet spices, that they might come anoint him. 20:1 first week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when dark, unto sepulchre, seeth stone taken away from sepulchre. 28:2 And, behold, there great earthquake: angel Lord descended from heaven, came rolled back stone from door, upon 28:3 countenance like lightning, raiment white snow: 28:4 fear keepers shake, became dead men. 28:5 angel answered said unto women, Fear know that seek Jesus, which crucified. 16:5 entering into sepulchre, they young sitting right side, clothed long white garment- they were affrighted. 24:4 came pass, they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, stood them shining garments: 20:12 seeth angels white sitting, head, other feet, where body Jesus lain. Matthew says guard paid tell this story, other gospel makes this claim. Matthew says angel tomb told Marys that Jesus also told them, tell disciples meet Galilee. disciples then went mountain previously agreed opon, Jesus there. This only appearance, except women tomb. Matthew only devotes five verses visit with disciples. Mark says that Jesus walked with disciples country, that they told rest disciples, refused believe. Later appeared disciples mealtime. Luke says followers went, same that Jesus rose from dead, Emmaus, village eight miles from Jeruselem, there Jesus jioned them unrecognised. While they meal together that evening, they finally recognised Jesus, whereopon dissapeared. Returning once Jeruselem, they told disciples their experience, suddenly Jesus appeared among them, frightening them, they thought spirit. Jesus then some fish honey then preached them. John says Jesus appeared disciples evening arrose, Jeruselem, where they were hiding. breathed Holy Ghost opon them, Thomas present refused believe. Eight days later Jesus joined disciples again same place this time convinced Thomas.\tOnce more Jesus made appearance disciples Tiberias again recognised. After telling them cast their netson other side boat, Jesus becomes known them prepares bread fish them. They together converse. book acts further adds confusion. says that Jesus showed himself apostles period days after resurection (thus contradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke John) spoke them things pertaining kingdom God: when spoken these things, while they beheld, taken cloud recieved their sight. while they looked steadfastly toward heaven went stood them white apparel: Which also said, Galilee, stand gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which taken from into heaven, shall comein like manneras have seen into heaven Acts 1:3-11 Paul outdoes every other authority saying that Jesus seen persons between time resurection assension, although does where.\tHe also claims that himself born time also Jesus. 15:6-8. Matthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus recieved into heaven after finished talking with disciples Jeruselem. Luke says Jesus desciples Bethany that while blessed them, parted from them carried into heaven. John says nothing about Acts contradicts above. (See previous section) 24:34 Verily unto you, This generation shall pass, till these things fulfilled. 13:30 Verily unto you, that this generation shall pass, till these things done. 21:32 Verily unto you, This generation shall pass away, till fulfilled. thessalonians 4:15-18 Corinthians 15:5 (12) Matthew 27:3-5 (minus from Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias elected until after resurrection) 28:16 Then eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into mountain where Jesus appointed them. \tAnd Elijah went whirlwind into heaven. Kings 2:11) \tNo hath ascended heaven that came down from heaven, \t... Man. (John 3:13) see, there number contradictions account trial, crucifiction resurection Jesus. these good witnesses, would think that they could SOME these important details right! fact, cannot find very many points where they AGREE. would think that they could least agree some points they were supposedly observing!)

Gain values conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, high-thrust interplanetary flight possible, because system acceleration (a(t)) capabilities always less than local gravitational acceleration. contrast, gain values 50-100 times higher found some fusion concepts, which offer high-thrust flight capability. performance example shows 53.3 (34.4 powered- 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 19\% payload single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle.

Motorola Inc. announced February that selected Delta launch most satellites 66-satellite Iridium communications constellation, April, McDonnell Douglas awarded USAF Medium Launch Vehicle contract. launch services contract with Motorola Iridium constellation launch launch least Iridium satellites. Another satellites have been contracted launched Khrunichev Enterprise Russian Proton vehicle launches. These satellites planned Delta will launched time, providing least launches. Additional satellites Iridium constellation, such planned on-orbit spares, also launched Delta. Although details launch services contract were reported negotiation, final. USAF contract also went MDC, bidding variant their Delta launcher. This contract only initially worth $7.5 million, establishes launch options launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002. These launches will deploy next generation USAF\'s Global Positioning System Block navigation satellites, plus other programs. First option meet USAF launch options expected exercised this year, after which USAF expected request launches Deltas year least years. Under this contract USAF also request launch demand services from 1996-2002 time period, with launch occur within days request. [Commentary: these contracts fulfilled, they should provide excellent business base MDC\'s Delta launch program through turn century. Combined, these contracts have potential about launches, worth about $2,200 MDC, sustaining core business base $300-400 M/year. Other contracts international commercial payloads, well NASA Medium ELV-class payloads, will this business base keeping viable commerical launch company. However, should noted there risk elements these contracts. Motorola\'s Iridium communications constellation received Federal Communications Commission license operation U.S., Motorola lined financing financial partners Iridium venture. Without these approvals financial backing there will Iridium launches. But, hopefully, these uncertainties will settled this year. Similarly, USAF program been target several Congressional actions which have slowed production Block satellites deleted funding program favor USAF NLS/Spacelifter program. this time, while appears contract will executed, future funding other USAF commercial launch contracts being reconsidered part national space launch strategy reviews. Some opinions expressed from within Administration Congress propose cancellation upgrade programs (including programs) favor proposed Spacelifter program. Such opinions have some weight this year\'s budget deliberations, particularly funds will more difficult find shrinking Defense budget.] COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS GO-AHEAD first commercial license operate remote sensing satellite approved early February Department Commerce\'s Office Space Commerce. license granted WorldView Imaging Corporation Oakland, California build operate pair imaging satellites provide multi-spectral images Earth. [Commentary: There been little data released this venture WorldView DoC, other than announcement operating construction license. This reported request WorldView. Most industry speculation identifies this venture Star Wars spinoff, using SDI-type technology provide digital Earth sensing data, heavily integrated into digital databases remote sensing/GIS users. Most probable customers this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, urban planners. noteworthy this first commercial venture under 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act. Act, passed last November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft sold users differing prices. Prior this act, remote sensing data from satellites sold users same prices, private remote sensing ventures would have sell government-set Landsat data prices. There rumors several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their through system different stages development. think large Landsat SPOT satellite systems will provide majority satellite remote sensing data market next decade contrast these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such WorldView others exploit market niches innovative technology, believe, find profitability margin. predict there some very interesting ventures appearing next year so.] INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE STILL GOOD INVESTMENT Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still moneymaker, despite having failed last Atlas launches. recent analyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said more than ever convinced that company return Atlas historical 95\%-plus success rate, this will become highly profitable, cash- generating unit. Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate management, Morgan Stanley projects that Atlas problems cleared unit could earnings year 1995 $100 year 2000. This based upon GD\'s projection capturing about Atlas launches year world market. [Commentary: Three failures their launch system hurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division. Since restructured only keep very profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might next sold. Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space Systems Division some potential moneymaker, despite current problems they their together. Sales projected about $560 1993, which will probably generate loss about capture their projected share space launch market, they have managed clean reliability their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales. until they demonstrate Atlas Centaur program back track, this division will continue show substantial losses. response sell-off rumors, opinion, this operation really good candidate takeover quick profitability. such takeover, current corporate divisional management would replaced with another from outside firm. SSD\'s case, division back track, management team will have concentrate hard technical problems with Atlas Centaur, well selling Atlas services. This would indicate only another firm with experience rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, able convince customers their launch services. Optimally, firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, experience marketing space technology internationally well. Candidates this might TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, Martin, possibly McDonnell Douglas Boeing. most those firms have cash flow problems (MDC), have substantial business contraction (Boeing MDC), involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), have taken substantial debt (Martin). coming with $700-1500 purchase price division chunk change company.] ARIANE PREDICTS LAUNCH DEMAND Arianespace, operator Ariane launch system, projecting launch demand late 1990\'s. early February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection space transportation market next decade. Over short run, Arianespace expects retain their dominant position sustain majority share launch market. international commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane holds contracts General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds contracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds Great Wall\'s Long March vehicle holds launch contracts. Three-quarters future launch contracts which Ariane compete projected come from communications satellites with remaining 25\% split between weather, Earth observation, scientific satellites. Most future telecommunications demand growth predicted come from Asia/Pacific region. Arianespace expects current market consolidation individual satellite operators into regional national groups will continue, with these groups investing heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. Arianespace predicts average mass telecommunications satellites should increase over today\'s average level, about 3000 GEO. Demand commercial launch services expected remain strong over next three years, second half decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease. Arianespace bases this prediction upon matching satellite transponder demand supply, particularly data compression techniques appear could double triple transponder capacity using existing near-term transponders. significant possible changes market identified arrival launch vehicles, including Russian launch systems. Arianespace predicts that long term, investors purchasing launch services looking best trade between launch service quality price, that Russian other launch services will have prove their capabilities service quality, their market penetration will minimal. [Commentary: Ariane releases their market surveys annually, reported their prior market survey past issue CSN/STI. Comparing surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences numbers. most notable change consideration data compression techniques, reducing demand physical transponders orbit. note that contrast some predictions, demand space- based communications transponders appears remain strong. While fiber optic lines making substantial inroads into established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand telecommunications services world wide point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented decrease space transponder demand. Fiberoptic cables provide higher capability service, only from established point established point establish fiberoptic link necessary install cable between points, while there improved network solutions, installing large network distributed fiberoptic links cost millions billions dollars. broadcast services where there existing ground network structure, satellites still offer most cost effective solution. services required into region, cheaper install small satellite link costing only tens thousands dollars into existing global satellite network. This allows rapid growth satellite services, kept demand high. replacement market fiberoptics growing well, since demand grows between points serviced, becomes cost effective later install fiberoptic link handle increase traffic. Since telecommunications data transfer markets still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy. satellites also getting longer orbital lifetimes. Current generation satellites getting guarantees years on-orbit service more, contrast years service from last generation\'s satellites. This back some launch demand, satellite owners rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals. last note- Arianespace didn\'t flag this year, looks like space transportation market will rather over- supplied existing launch systems near term. annual commercial launch demand about 15-20 medium sized satellites year. From supply side, Ariane capable launching about dozen medium sized satellites year, Delta capable about 9-12 year, Atlas capable 6-12, Long March 4-8, Japan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable other systems such Zenit Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches year. That\'s capability small market. only expect competition intensify commercial launches.] NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT Pegasus launch Orbital Sciences Corporation spawned investigation over apparent violation range safety rules. valid abort order from NASA range safety officer halt mission overridden Pegasus launched violation range safety rules. last minutes Pegasus launch countdown, abort command receivers aboard Pegasus failed. Such failure typically scrubs launch,and NASA range safety officer Wallops Island, issued mission abort order about minute before scheduled Pegasus launch. Somehow this command overridden launch team message lost communications channels, Pegasus launched despite valid abort call. Fortunately, Pegasus functioned expected, abort command receiver needed. this incident spark investigation since valid abort order given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, obeyed. Leading investigation National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, Force. This investigation marks first time NTSB taken lead incident involving space launch. According NTSB, their investigation will take about months, primarily looking lines authority, communications links safety procedures used launch. [Commentary: This first time that NTSB investigation into space launch. Their leadership requested Department Commerce\'s Office Commercial Space Transportation, licensed commercial launch. time writing this column, some initial investigations have been concluded, some results starting leak into trade press. Apparently, four different communications channels were during test. After abort destruct receiver stopped responding, NASA test director range controller Mission Control room Wallops Island gave abort orders about minute before launch. According mission rules, this should have stopped launch. Somehow, test conductor ordered abort reversed, NASA communicator relayed that order B-52 carrying Pegasus about seconds before launch. Differing explainations exactly this happened proposed with best being that clear lines communications clear definition responsibilities mission control team, understanding mission rules were established before launch. more more commercial launches, more these procedural issues going crop will have resolved. This case interesting because first time NTSB been called investigate commercial launch problem they with commercial aircraft problems). think this problem will turn primarily problems with procedures communications, will cleared with issuance guidelines launch communications should specific lines authority should delineated.] ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR ANNOUNCED Tsniimach Enterprise Russia announced marketing small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components. versions launcher being marketed: Aerokosmos winged vehicle launched like Pegasus, Severkosmos, launched from mobile ground transporter.

This one\'s little different that they offering variants ex-Soviet ICBMs, can\'t identify customers being targeted substantial financial backing.] GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released results preliminary study feasibility commercial rocket launching site Camden County, Georgia Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site Atlantic coast. preliminary study recommended site pursued commercial launch site, stating reopening site feasible projected investment returns, plus environmental other geographic considerations. However, report site might ideal other aerospace uses, recommended other potential uses. [Commentary: This should nails coffin Kingsland Commercial Launch Site. While other sites still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland found without customer anchor tenant, substantial infrastructure then expected returns were justify cost development. This might point some discriminators judging feasibility commercial launch site. These include: there identified customer provide core usage sufficient recover setup costs? there market advantage using site? existing infrastructure used modified site? financing found enough cost support investment? Other commercial launch site ventures including those Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore Platform, Hawaii, Vandenberg have also judged against these criteria. opinion, some these ventures flying hope speculation, sound financial grounds.] SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING last official acts, former President Bush authorized space technology transfer several joint space ventures between other firms. these proposed technology Spain build small booster. With that regulatory impediment removed, 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning first launch 1995/96 time period. Capricornia described small 3-stage solid booster designed 250-500 into LEO. Several launch sites being examined system, including Iberian peninsula Canary Islands. Originated INTA Spain, project reports development funding, will technology from Argentina\'s Condor launch vehicle well from [Commentary: Several firms have identified market opportunity providing small launcher European market. Small payloads from European firms organizations currently either Ariane piggyback launches US/Italian Scout launcher.

Space technologies have been specifically targeted part this program, beginning with manufacture launch advanced multi-purpose satellite 1997. objective this investment raise South Korea\'s aerospace technology level world\'s countries 2000. [Commentary: South Korea been quietly working develop national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. I\'m noting this flag that potential players coming into commercial space market. part their national effort, national telecommunications satellites Korea Telecom will launched April 1995 Delta. Designated Koreasat platforms will provide television telephone service throughout Korean Peninsula, southwestern Japan portions China bordering North Korea. South Korea launched first small satellite piggyback Ariane 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) costing about $8.8 Uribyol-2 planned piggyback launch October this year, again Ariane, will entirely made Korea. Uribyol-3, projected 1995 launch, will environment- monitoring micro-satellite.

987;Jim, always thought that homophobe only word used rallies, didn\'t beleive real people used Let\'s agree term\'s definition. homophobe actively militantly attacks homosexuals because actually latent homosexual uses hostility conceal true orientation. Since everyone disapproves condemns homosexuality homophobe (your implication clear), must necessarily follow that latent homosexuals bisexual very least. Crap crap crap crap crap. definition type \'phobe comes from phobia irrational fear Hence homophobe (not only meetings, word apparently general now. perhaps isn\'t bible? Wouldst thou prefer were communicate with thou bilespeak?) Does arachnophobe have irrational fear being spider? Does agoraphobe have irrational fear being wide open space? understand English? Obviously someone phobia will react They will their best avoid that possible they will either strike away. gaybashings occur because natural processes? People definately have homophobia will either away from people cause them themselves) violence. Isn\'t that what said What taking issue with here, your remarks merely parenthetical mine nothing useful. [...] would seem homosexuality evolutionary function (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs when members generation pass along their traits subsequent generations. Homosexuality evolutionary deadend. take your usage term, homophobe, sense seem intend, then really homosexual evolution species least, going nowhere. *every* time with woman they intend produce children? Hmm...no wonder world overpopulated. Obviously keep Monty Python song: Every sperm sacred. *you* say, purpose means limit population growth then your arguement, natural. Consider context, I\'m talking about evolutionary function. most basic requirements evolution that members species procreate, those don\'t have purpose that context. Another point that offspring each generation survive, participation both parents necessary family must exist, since homosexuals reproduce, they cannot constitute family. Since majority humankind part family, homosexuality evolutionary abberation, contrary nature will. Well that true, your arguements homosexuals would have vanished *years* non-procreation. Also parent from single parent families should babies cold now, they must, your arguement, die. your argument, homosexuality genetically determined. your second point, prove again that have idea what context means. talking about evolution, preservation species, fundamental premise whole process. gets worse. Since overwhelming majority people actually -prefer- heterosexual relationship, homosexuality social abberation well. homosexual eschews biological imperative reproduce then social imperative form participate most fundamental social element, family. wait, there\'s more. Read above. expect have least children now, with family growing. These days less with procreation (admittedly without there would no-one) more with pleasure. pre-pill pre-condom days, there chance producing children. These days just ain\'t true! People decide whether have children when. Soon they will able choose it\'s (but that\'s another arguement...) it\'s more lifestyle decision. Again your arguement, since homosexuals choose not) reproduce they must akin people decide have children. Both unnatural each other. another non-sequitur. evolutionary function that exists procreation, that also recreation incidental. That homosexuals don\'t procreate means that -only- recreation nothing more- they serve -evolutionary- purpose. Since homosexuals have come closet have convinced some policy makers that they have civil rights, they claiming that their sexuality preference, life-style, orientation, choice that should protected law. homosexuality mere choice both contrary nature anti-social, then perverse choice- they have even less credibility than before they became prominent. People people people. tell anyone else live their life? god(tm)? fancy date? Here\'s pretty obvious dodge, really think you\'ve said anything just feel obligated respond every statement? telling anyone anything, demonstrating that there arguments against practice homosexuality (providing it\'s merely alternate lifestlye) that homophobic, that reasonably call perverse context even atheist understand. realize course that this comes dangerously close establishing value, that atheists compelled object that basis, consistent, have case this regard. characterize opposition homosexuality homophobic ignore some very compelling arguments against legitimization homosexual life-style. since charge only intended intimidate, it\'s really just demogoguery taken seriously. Fact Jim, there more persuasive arguments suppressing homosexuality than those given, consider this start. Again crap. your arguments based outdated ideals. Likewise bible. Would honest Christian condemn generations spawned bastard eternal damnation? someone crushes penis (either accidently not..!). Both Deuteronomy. I\'m sure your comment pertains something, you\'ve disguised well can\'t what. Where mention ideals, out-dated otherwise? Your arguments very reactionary- have anything contribute? homosexuals should excluded from participation scouting, reasons same those used restrict them from teaching- their logic, homosexuals deviates, social biological. Since adult role model child, incumbent parent ensure that child isolated from those would child harm. this case, harm means primarily social, though that could extended easily enough. show *anyone* that everyone would describe normal, will take (Puma baseball cap) you. man\'s meat another man\'s poison!

This shift effected moving front back clipping planes used PEXlib view table entry lines just hair backwards (i.e. smaller coordinates), compared their positions view table entry used areas.

April 1993 RELEASE: 93-64 John Gibbons, Director, Office Science Technology Policy, outlined members-designate Advisory Committee Redesign Space Station April three budget options guidance committee their deliberations redesign space station. option billion, mid-range option billion high option billion will considered committee. Each option would cover total expenditures space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 would include funds development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost also must include adequate program reserves insure program implementation within available funds. Over next years, billion reserved within NASA budget President\'s technology investment. result, station options above billion must accompanied offsetting reductions rest NASA budget. example, space station option billion would require billion offsets from NASA budget over next years. Gibbons presented information organizational session advisory committee. Generally, members-designate focused upon administrative topics used session acquainted. They also received legal ethics briefing orientation process Station Redesign Team following develop options advisory committee consider. Gibbons also announced that United States international partners Europeans, Japanese Canadians have decided, after consultation, give full consideration Russian assets course space station redesign process. that end, Russians will asked participate redesign effort as-needed consulting basis, that redesign team make their expertise assessing capabilities possible other Russian capabilities systems. U.S. international partners hope benefit from expertise Russian participants assessing Russian systems technology. overall goal redesign effort develop options reducing station costs while preserving research exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration Russian assets could factor achieving that goal. Gibbons reiterated that, President Clinton committed redesigned space station making every effort preserve science, technology jobs that space station program represents. However, also committed space station that well managed that does consume national resources which should used invest future this industry this nation. NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said Russian participation will accomplished through East-West Space Science Center University Maryland under leadership Roald Sagdeev.';2

Studies indicate that they reality have only minute impact, both absolute terms relative other chemical sources. remainder this item response from author quoted study, Charles Jackman. atmospheric modelling study space shuttle effects stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, organized Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute Space Studies. three groups involved Michael Prather Maria Garcia (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), Malcolm (Atmospheric Environmental Research, Inc.). effort look effects space shuttle Titan rockets stratosphere. following estimated sources stratospheric chlorine: Industrial sources: 300,000,000 kilograms/year Natural sources: 75,000,000 kilograms/year Shuttle sources:\t 725,000 kilograms/year shuttle source assumes space shuttles Titan rockets launched yearly. Thus launches would less than 0.25\% total stratospheric chlorine sources. effect ozone minimal: global yearly average total ozone would decreased 0.0065\%. This much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity solar flares. influence human-made chlorine products ozone computed atmospheric model calculations decrease globally averaged ozone between 1980 1990. influence space shuttle Titan rockets stratosphere negligible. launch schedule Space Shuttle Titan rockets would need increased over factor hundred order have about same effect ozone increases industrial halocarbons present time.

Much this royal dating even some tales problematic: example, Daniel speaks Nebuchadrezzar\'s transformation into beast, story that reported Qumran scrolls Nabonidus- Belshazzar portrayed last king Babylon, although never king- Darius called Mede conquered Babylon placed before Cyrus Persia, although such Darius known (the Medes followed Persians, Darius name several Persian kings).

316;regular questions about gamma correction since great pains deal with properly (the image loader program maintain). Here explanation often answer these questions. This might suitable inclusion FAQ. \tGraeme Gill. ########################################################################### note gamma correction images Author: Graeme Gill graeme@labtam.oz.au Date: 93/5/16 What this gamma stuff anyway -------------------------------------- Although would nice think that image image, there complications. only there whole bunch different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc), there whole other technical stuff that makes dealing with images complicated. Gamma those things. you\'ve ever downloaded images from net, you\'ve probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look some look dark, some look light. this ask. This, gamma correction lack it). need gamma correction -------------------------------------- Gamma correction needed because nature CRTs (cathode tubes monitors usually used viewing images). have some sort real live scene turn into computer image measuring amount light coming from each point scene, then have created linear un-gamma-corrected image. This good thing many ways because manipulate image values image file were light (ie. adding multiplying will work just like real light real world). take image file turn each pixel value into voltage feed into CRT, find that _doesn\'t_ give amount light proportional voltage. amount light coming from phosphor screen depends voltage something like this: Light_out voltage crt_gamma just dump your nice linear image CRT, image will look much dark. this have gamma correct image first. need opposite what will image, that things cancel out, what want. have this your image: gamma_corrected_image image (1/crt_gamma) most CRTs, crt_gamma somewhere between 3.0. that does seem complicated ----------------------------------------------------- problem that display programs gamma correction. Also sources images give linear images (Video cameras video signals general). Because this, images already have some gamma correction done them, rarely sure much. display those images with program that does gamma correction you, image gets corrected twice looks light. display those images with program that doesn\'t gamma correction, then will look vaguely right, perfect, because gamma correction exactly right particular CRT. Whose fault this ----------------------- really three things. those display programs there that don\'t gamma correction properly. Another that most image formats don\'t specify standard gamma, don\'t have some recording what their gamma correction third thing that many people understand what gamma correction about, create images with varying gamma\'s. least file formats right thing. Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format semi-standard recording gamma image. JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies that image encoded must have gamma (ie. linear image everyone obeys rules). Some image loaders (for instance image utility) allow specify only gamma monitor using, individual gamma values image trying view. Other image viewers (eg. another image program) utilities (eg. toolkit) provide ways changing gamma image, have figure overall gamma correction yourself, allowing undoing gamma correction image has, then gamma correction need suite your monitor. Note that 2.21 doesn\'t provide easy modifying gamma image. need adjust curves appropriate gamma ColEdit controls. Altering Intensity controls doesn\'t right thing, fails take account effect gamma This tends give tint image. figure what viewer does, what gamma screen --------------------------------------------------------------------- simplest that loading file chkgamma.jpg (provided with distribution), which JFIF jpeg format file containing grayscale ramps. ramps chosen look linear human eye, using continuous tones, other using dithering. your viewer does right thing gamma corrects images, then ramps should look symmetrical, point which they look equally bright should almost exactly half from bottom. find this point helps move away little from screen, de-focus your eyes bit.) your viewer doesn\'t gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have long dark part short white part, point equal brightness will above center. your viewer does have setting right amount gamma correction display, then equal brightness point above center increase gamma, decrease below center. value will usually around [with instance, adjust display gamma with -dispgamma flag, once you\'ve right, DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable your .profile] figure what gamma image ------------------------------------------------- This most tricky bit. general rule seems that true color (ie. bit, .ppm .jpg) images have gamma (linear), although there many about that have some gamma correction. seems that majority pseudo color images (ie. images with color maps .gif etc.) gamma corrected some degree other. your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good, gamma corrected images will look light. your viewer doesn\'t gamma correction, then linear images will look dark, gamma corrected images will Linear images sometimes such good thing ----------------------------------------------------- reason that many high quality formats (such Video) gamma correction that actually makes better storage medium. This because human logarithmic response light, gamma correction similar compression characteristic. This means images could make better bits color (for instance), they used gamma correction. implication though, that every time want image processing should convert image linear bits retain same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, none popular image formats agree standard gamma correction factor, difficult justify gamma corrected images popular level. some image formats standardize particular gamma, image manipulation software takes care extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data, then gamma corrected distribution images would good thing. told that Kodak PhotoCD format instance, standard gamma correction factor that enables highest quality bits used hold image).';1

1289;King James Version Bible there three differents words translated into word hell. These Greek words have totally different meanings. words Hades, Tartaros, Gehenna. bibical usage, Greek word Hades used only times Testament, roughly equivalent Testament word Sheol... meaning grave (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10). Hades likened hole ground. Bible nothing with fire!) Most modern bibical translators admit that English word hell translate Hades Sheol unfortunate misleading practice. Why? Because when seeing word hell many readers impute traditional connotation ever-burning inferno, when this never remotely intended Greek language English! true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer state abode dead, sense spirits walking around some sort shadowy realm. Hades simply abode call grave. dead this hell. second hell Bible, Tartaros, mentioned only once scripture, Pet.2:4- spared angels that sinned, cast them down hell (TARTAROS), delivered them into chains darkness reserved unto judgment... Following their rebellion unseat from throne (Isa.14:12-14- Rev.12:4), archangel Lucifer (now Satan) third created angels (now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18). They were cast down Tartaros, place condition restraint that imposed mutinous angels they await ultimate judgment (Jude Cor.6:3). Tartaros, then, hell that applies only evil, rebellious angels demons interesting that ancient Greeks used this word describe place which Zeus confined rebellious Titans). Nowhere Bible there mention being into this particular hell. third word that translated hell Bible Gehenna. comes from Hebrew HINNOM, meaning valley Hinniom. Hinnom deep, narrow ravine located south southwest Jerusalem. Testament times place abominable pagan rites, including infant sacrifice there that apostate kings Ahaz Manasseh made their children pass through fire Molech. rites were specifically celebrated Tophet, place abhorrence, chief groves valley). King Josiah ancient Judah finally these abominations. defiled valley, rendering ceremonially unclean Kings 23:10). Later valley became cesspool city dump Jerusalem- repository sewage, refuse animal carcasses. bodies dispised criminals were also burned there along with rubbish. Fires burned continuously, feeding constant supply garbage refuse. Aceldama, field blood, purchased with money Judas received betrayal Christ (Matt.27:8) also part valley Hinnom. what does this valley called Gehenna have with hell? Rev.19:20: Satan inspired political dictator miracle-working religious figure, False Prophet, working with will resist re-establishment government Jesus Christ Second Coming. Their fate revealed apostle John: beast taken, with false prophet... These both were cast alive into lake fire burning with brimstone. Where will this temporary lake fire (this hell) prophet Isaiah wrote this lake fire prepared Beast: Tophet valley Hinnom) ordained old, king prepared, hath made deep large, pile thereof fire wood, breath Lord, like stream brimstone, doth kindle (Isa.30:33). thousand years later, Satan himself will cast into this rekindled fiery lake where Beast False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10). what wicked have died over millennia? Does Bible that they suffering fiery punishment their sins lake fire? sequence Rev.20 incorrigibly wicked resurrected thrown into lake fire after Satan cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will become these wicked? Will they writhe flames eternity? wicked will burned from intense heat coming Gehenna fire earth. They consumed, annihilated, destroyed! This punishment will everlasting (permanent final). Bible calls second death (Rev.20:14- 21:8), from which there possibility further resurrection. Bible does teach eternal punishment, eternal punishing. prophet Malachi provides graphic description. For, behold, cometh that shall burn oven, proud, yea, that wickedly, shall stubble, that cometh shall burn them up... (4:1). righteous, says that wicked shall ashes under soles your feet...(Mal.4:3). Gehenna place destruction death, place living torture! Jesus talking Jews understood about this Gehenna valley Hinnom. Utter destruction fire complete. Nothing left, ashes! Every text Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means complete destruction, living torture (not eternal life torment)! Bible says, Romans 6:23, wages death, eternal life torture. punishment revealed Bible Death... cessation life.;3

This probably longest entire collection. ________________________________________________________ that Prophecy Fulfilled considering Christian religion, judging according claims, important look claims fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy. scribe Matthew perhaps most eager draw what thinks prophetic answers career Jesus Nazareth. will see, Matthew\'s main strategy take various Testament passages, often even about promised Messiah, apply them circumstances Testament. must also bear mind question authenticity accounts. Since gospels were written least years after Jesus executed, know much happened exactly stated. But, purposes analysis, will take particular claims face value. Immanuel: begin, course, beginning. 1.21-22): [Mary] will bear son, you, Joseph, will name \'Jesus\' (which means G\'d salvation), will save people from their sins. this happened fulfil what lord spoken prophet: [Isaiah 7.1-16]: days Ahaz BCE), king Judah, Rezin Syria Pekah Israel made Jerusalem (capitol Judah), could quite conquer When house David (i.e. Ahaz court Judah) were told this, ...its heart heart people shook... And, lord G\'d said Isaiah, meet with Ahaz... ...And lord spoke Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah, naturally) saying, sign G\'d your lord. deep Sheol high heaven. But, Ahaz said, won\'t ask- will lord test. Then (Isaiah) said, Hear then, house David. enough weary men, that must weary too? Therefore, lord himself will give sign: Behold, young woman with child will bear son, name Immanuel, which means, G\'d with will curds honey when knows refuse evil choose good. For, before child knows refuse evil choose good, land kings dread will have been deserted... Matthew homes just sentence that italics. Further, Hebrew word almah, (young woman), specifically, virgin. But, this prophecy about Messiah. prophecy about event happen years later. prophecy about virgin (bethulah) mother. short, about Jesus. Matthew made verse context, tries make specific case Mary. should noted that want read prophecy general manner, very general one, made Mary. Mary, virgin not, indeed young woman with child. course, shady problems. Jesus, while thought later Christians G\'d walking among men, never called name, Immanuel. Christianity wished claim this prophecy Jesus, becomes best cut-and-paste prophecy... second class prophecy. convincing. Egypt: After Jesus\'s birth Bethlehem, Matthew tells about quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion Egypt, wishes liken Jesus Moses. This done escape alleged infanticidal rampage king, Herod. 2.15] ...and remained there until death Herod. This fulfil what lord spoken: Egypt have cal-led son. What lord really said this. [Hosea 11.1] When Israel child, loved him. And, Egypt called son. more called them people), more they went from they kept sacrificing Ba\'als, kept burning incense idols. Matthew conveniently omits rest Hosea\'s oracle. But, indeed Israel that, once called Egypt, wanted return. This history. Jesus certainly being spoken here. And, draw some kind parallel here, wind with Jesus that flees resists G\'d. Again, this prophecy just convincing Matthew probably hoped. Rachel Weeps: While Jesus vacationing Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought kill him, thus ordered executions young male children. Matthew then writes, 2.17-18] this, that which spoken prophet Jeremiah fulfilled: voice heard Ramah, wailing loud lamentation-- Rachel weeping children- refused consoled, because they were more. reference passage Jeremiah 31.15, referring carrying Israel into exile Sargon Assyria) BCE. Rachel, ancestor major tribes Israel, Ephraim, Manasseh, said weep descendants more. metaphorical, course, since Rachel lived dies before Hebrews were even Egyptian exile. interesting note that Leah, Rachel, ancestor Judeans (the land where Jesus Bethlehem were). anyone should weeping children, Leah. only connexion that Rachel with Bethlehem that legends have that buried north city, Ephrath, (Bethlehem). Herod infanticide, rather unlikely that such event actually occurred. never knows, event mentioned alluded anywhere else Bible, mentioned secular records time. Herod particularly unliked reign, many less evil deeds Herod were carefully recorded. This might prime example events were added Jesus\'s life enhance message church\'s gospel. Because whole story\'s similarity tale infant Moses Egypt, highly likely that device Matthew prophetic, artificial, approval Jesus. surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects mention rest Jeremiah quote. children prophet speaks dead, exiled Assyrian Empire. G\'d comforts weeping Rachel, saying that children will returned-- will gather them back together. course, this would suit Matthew\'s purpose, children speaks dead good. Again, prophecy Matthew sets even that, anyone bothers check out, convincing. Nazarene: even have next chapter find another Matthean prophecy. After leaving Egypt, Joseph wife take infant Jesus live city Nazareth, 2.23] ...that what spoken prophets might fulfilled, shall called Nazarene. First thing notice that Matthew does mention name prophet(s) this time. Second, have There Messianic prophecies speaking Nazarene. Worse, there prophecies, period, mentioning Nazarene. Still worse, there Nazarenes mentioned Testament all. book Judges, angel tells Samson\'s mother that will, [Judges 13.5] ...conceive bear son. razor shall tough head, will Nazirite from birth. will deliver Israel from hands Philistines. This course prophecy Jesus, messiah G\'d. But, best that found. Obviously, Matthew begun overboard cut-and-paste prophecies, that simple making them now. Bearing Diseases: Jesus next goes around healing people physical illnesses disabilities. 8.17] This fulfil what spoken prophet Isaiah, took infirmities bore diseases. expected, verse quoted Isaiah quoted context, words skewed Christian scheme. have, 53.4] Surely [the suffering servant], borne sickness, carried pains. From reading surrounding passages Isaiah, know that prophet speaking present tense collective nation Israel, Jehovah\'s chosen servant people. speaks Israelites suffering exile, voice gentile nations that look upon This image deeply ingrained Jewish identity --an image chastised, cherished, Israel instrument nations\' salvation G\'d. verses speak Israel taking sicknesses which literal metaphorical manifestations guilt discipline. They speak servant going around healing people. Notice that servant Isaiah takes sicknesses pains nations (and individual Jews). Jesus, know, take diseases onto himself. verses here Isaiah prophecy something come, rather something that already happened. While believed that Jesus took eternal punishment hell, bear illnesses healed. while someone might want that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted deeds Israel spiritual atonement, admit that Matthew\'s parallel misses where intended have effect. Silent Messiah: Upon healing multitudes commoners, said that Jesus ordered them keep quiet, presumable that wouldn\'t arouse attention local rulers. 12.15-21] This fulfill what spoken prophet Isaiah. Behold servant whom have chosen, beloved, with whom soul pleased. will spirit him, will announce justice Gentiles. will wrangle aloud, will anyone hear voice streets. will break bruised reed quench smoldering wick until brings justice victory, gentiles will hope name. Isaiah passage quoted reads, 42.1-4] Behold servant whom uphold, chosen, whom soul delights. have spirit him, will bring forth justice nations. will lift voice, make heard street. will break bruised reed, quench smoldering wick. will faithfully bring forth justice. will fail (burn dimly) discouraged (bruised) until established justice earth. coastlands await law. see, Matthew conveniently left part passage, because does suit dealings Jesus. Christians could never think Jesus failing, never would light mankind burn dimly. But, servant nation Israel will indeed come when done. When gentiles come embrace G\'d there will longer chosen people, rather will children G\'d. Also, ending phrase been changed from Judaic ...the coastlands await law. Christologic, Gentiles will hope name. While original proclaims Torah Jehovah, other rewrites strange doctrine believing name. doubt servant referred Jesus, only read whole chapter, Isaiah hear about beloved blind imperfect servant, people robbed plundered... that when Matthew\'s attempt prophecy examined, crumbles. Three Days Three Nights: come upon prophecy supposedly uttered very mouth Jesus himself. speaks crucifixion resurrection. 12.40] Jonah belly whale three days three nights, will heart earth three days three nights. Before further discussion occur, necessary know Jews understood days. names went, each hours long, lasting from sunset following sunset 6pm. What referred period light from ending sunset 6pm. Thus, according time scale, sabbath began Friday evening, lasted until saturday evening. This Jews celebrate their sabbath daylight portion Saturdays, instead Sundays. seems like real miracle that Christians didn\'t forget that Saturday indeed seventh last week!) Thus, when days nights referred together, hour daylight portions hour night periods being spoken Thus, Jesus says that will grave, hell, otherwise unresurrected three days three nights. good book tells Jesus crucified ninth hour, which 3pm, Friday afternoon. then into grave sometime after that. Then, Jesus left grave, rose, before dawn what call Sunday (The dawn after sabbath over). What this means that Jesus was, using time clarity, grave from Friday night some time before Sunday morning. could also little time before Friday, since bible specific here. What this means using Jewish time that grave day, nights, possibly couple hours day. Certainly this problem Jesus prediction. There absolutely even able have death involve three days three nights --even using modern time measurements. then suspect that this error another Matthew\'s little mistakes, that gospel writer false words into god\'s mouth. matter made prediction, more than unconvincing... counter-convincing. Hearing Understanding: Jesus tool habit speaking vast audiences parables-- stories which deeper meaning could found, were already elect, those chosen understand message Jesus. reasons that those understand parables ones wants. people cannot understand them, there need bother with them, since they will accept plain message better. Matthew says, 13.14-16] With them [the audience] indeed fulfilled prophecy Isaiah which says, will indeed hear never understand- will indeed see, never perceive. Because this people\'s heart grown dull, their ears heavy hearing, they have shut their eyes they would perceive with them, with their ears, understand with their heart, turn heal them. original Isaiah passages part earlier works, call ministry. This BCE, when Israel flourishing, right before falls under authority Assyria. Isaiah sees good times ending, also vision from G\'d, calling bring reform Israel Judah. 6.9-13] G\'d said, this people, `Hear hear, understand- see, perceive.\' Make heart this people fat, make their ears heavy, shut their eyes, they will with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, turn healed. Then Isaiah said, long, lord? said, Until cities waste without inhabitant, houses without men, land utterly desolate, G\'ds take away, forsaken places many land. though tenth will remain will burned again, like terebinth whose stump still stands when tree felled. holy seed stump. Here that really G\'d causes people Israel stop listening prophet\'s warnings, reaffirms promise made Solomon\'s (and David\'s) seed/lineage. read rest Isaiah, find that this done fulfil plan G\'d Israel servant, light nations. (Look Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3) that Matthew cut-and-pasted just little portion Isaiah\'s verse, suit gospel needs. More than that, altered words, make people didn\'t understand Jesus\'s stories. And, see, Isaiah\'s verses prophecies, rather commands from G\'d him, present. Once again, Matthew\'s prophecy falls flat face. Matthew tries again make Jesus\'s parables look like they have prophetic approval. 13.35] ...he said nothing them without parable. This fulfil what spoken prophet, will open mouth them parables. will utter that which been hidden since foundation world. Matthew really botches here. attempts quote from prophet, from Psalms. 78.2-4] will open mouth parable. will utter dark sayings old, things that have heard known, things that fathers have told will hide them from their children, tell coming generation glorious deeds lord... pointed out, verses Psalms really come from prophet. might also want know that earlier copies Matthew\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\'s name this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught error tried cover some Perhaps most significant part this that, once again, Matthew altered Testament Scriptures. Jesus said earlier, speaks parables that some will understand them. parables Psalms hidden. Further, they speak things known, that fathers have told Jesus deals with things hidden since foundation world. Indeed Jesus dealt secrecy confusion. This direct opposition parables Psalms. wonder Matthew rewrite them! still once again, Matthew\'s artificial prophecies fall flat their face. But, Christians rarely look this. Matthew\'s prophecies aren\'t only things about Christianity that beginning look bad. Excuses Little Faith: 17.14-21, that disciples able around casting demons, except case. knowing what epilepsy was, people thought those with disease were possesed with demons. wonder that disciples were unable dispossess epileptic. But, Jesus, perhaps more enlightened than they, reported have rebuked them, saying they didn\'t have enough faith. This seems strange. this demon special? seems that either true believer faith does not. Apparently, enough faith will allow someone move mountains. course, will find one, these days that move real mountains. parts seas. only miracles Charismatics speak those rumoured happen trips Mexico some faraway place. Major miracles making some woman\'s arthritis feel better Sunday morning T.V. gods, including Jesus, always shrouded ancient lore writings, protected from skeptics their sacred pasts.

Sometimes, they say, love these people worship with... lives people change... that seeing G\'d. Thus people lulled sleep, satisfied with turning G\'d into everyday sights. But, that seeing G\'d speaking of... seeing G\'d people used see. What world that good, compassion human hearts, love given taken women, forgiveness practised Christian Atheist alike, beauty created mind man. These things that done- these what see. But, said this only because everybody little faith. Jesus Rides Ass: Shortly after accepting role Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests donkey brought ride into Jerusalem. 21.5] This took place fulfil what spoken prophet, saying, Tell daughter Zion, Behold, your king coming you, humble, mounted ass, ass-colt. course, passage quoted from Zechariah reads little differently. your king comes you- triumphant victorious, humble, riding ass, ass- colt... will command peace nations. There isn\'t that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves animal --an ass-colt-- while Matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently. Thus, Jesus call both colt adult ass. From Matthew\'s version, comical picture divine Christ sweating straddle donkeys. This could inevitably lead theological, proctological dilemma! find that account written earlier Mark, only colt called brought Jesus. This indeed fits verses Zechariah properly, shows that Matthew attempt prophetic verses, bungled. Now, excluding many respectable Christians have met, have noticed that while Christ thought have ridden asses, situation often reversed nowadays... Then, entering Jerusalem temple, priests were angered people youngsters calling Jesus messiah. But, Jesus replied might expect Matthew have done, 21.16] Haven\'t read? `Out mouth babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise.\' more likely that Matthew made this response since Jesus never point such little prophetic things since, might expect, quote error, which seems Matthew\'s track record quite well. might Jesus Matthew, Haven\'t read? source reads, [Psalms 8.1-2] YaHWeH lord, majestic your name whole world! You, whose glory chanted above heavens babes infants, have founded bulwark against your foes still enemy avenger. passages hardly need comment. There perfect praise spoken psalm, what praise there given G\'d, messiah king, Jesus. mentioned, seems just more case Matthew\'s making convenient prophetic scripture. YHVH said lord...: Jesus said have asked from whom promised Jewish messiah-king descended. Jews agree-- king David. But, then Jesus counters quoting Psalms 110, LORD said Lord, right hand, until your enemies under your feet. Taken face value, Jesus denying necessity Davidic descent. assumes opposition their answer. course, Christian answer that agrees, trying make some hidden point, reveal some mystery about divine nature messiah-king. It\'s tempting believe this, Christian interested matters investigation. But, there problems. Jesus\'s time, psalm thought about messiah. And, easy David might refer messiah superior. need only look scriptures about messiah that expected great king, bringing Jews times even better than those under David\'s rule. course, Jews listening good answer, passage could indeed refer divine messiah, such Christians worship. problem lies meaning this psalm, error that apparently several Jews Jesus\'s time also made. must remember that there were various factions among Jews, often result different expectations messiah-king. Jesus apparently these adventists, like audience, thought messiah\'s advent imminent, interpreted Psalms 110, among others, being messianic. What problem, then? Psalm literally reads, YHVH\'s utterance lord: \tSit right hand, until make your enemies your footstool. YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion. Rule midst your foes! Your people will offer themselves freely lead your host holy mountains. priest order Melchizedek forever. word lord often mistakenly capitalised Christian bibles denote divinity this lord. But, Hebrew, word adoni, capitalisation exists. Adoni simply means lord, generic term would used often scriptures refer kings G\'d. merely address respect. There nothing text itself imply that word refers either divinity messiah-king. That this supposed written David certain. title psalm translates either psalm David, psalm about David. seems fitting assume written court poet, about David\'s covenant endorsement from G\'d. psalm been written David, unlikely that would talking about messiah. idea perfect king, descended from David, present David\'s age. have extensive tales David\'s doings sayings-- none which include praises messiah. Many psalms show evidence being written long after David dead, times exile when G\'d show favour David\'s kingdom hold. description psalm David very well. David promised G\'d rise power, victory over enemies, successful judgement among nations conquered. achieved priesthood common Melchizedek being righteous king, enabled bless people. fits. have blame this problem Matthew alone, though. Here, there artificial prophecy alluded though scripture rather questionable. Still, this event common other gospels too. Matthew little more easily this time. interesting note, though, Matthew dresses event. earlier gospel Mark tells tale with Jesus simply speaking crowd. Matthew Pharisees, became religious competition infant Christianity, target Jesus\'s question. might expect, Matthew writes that event ends embarrassing Pharisees. Such power pen. Moses Jesus, Together Along...: leave gospel story Matthew momentarily pseudo-prophecy John\'s gospel. gospel story John deserves special treatment, because seems removed from real events Jesus\'s career told even Matthew. But, moment, will just look verse. early church leaders founded religion Jewish hopes messiah king, artificial extension original promises made G\'d. When constructing history Abraham, Moses wrote promise land nationhood Jewish people. While this accomplished eventually, under rule king David, Christians came along later decided that they would claim fulfillment promise. But, they expanded promise, preaching about heavenly kingdom. [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham, rejoiced day. glad. would nice approval Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing Jesus messiah, anything Christian. have tried, failed find event Testament which corresponds John\'s little prophecy. course John making Testament backings, just like forerunner Matthew. Many Christians know that their faith many foundations such fraud, surprising they still cling Potter\'s Field: told that Jesus betrayed while Jerusalem followers, Judas Iscariot. Matthew writes, 27.5-10] throwing down pieces silver temple, [Judas] departed... But, chief priests, taking silver, said, isn\'t lawful treasury, since blood money. they... bought potter\'s field with bury strangers in... Then fulfilled what spoken prophet Jeremiah, they took thirty pieces silver, price whom price been some sons Israel, they gave them potter\'s field, lord directed This prophecy utterly gross bastardisation Testament Scripture. First, Matthew made mistake regarding name prophet. Zechariah utters verses which Matthew makes [Zech. 11.12-13] ...And they weighed wages, thirty shekels silver. Then YHVH said Cast them treasury, --the lordly price which paid them. took thirty shekels silver cast them into treasury house YHVH. First all, verses Zechariah deal with betrayer messiah, G\'d. deal with shepherd, most likely priest, chosen serve function presiding over people shortly before G\'d would send Judah Israel into conflict with another. word, treasury, been replaced King James Scholars with potter, precisely because this made Matthew\'s quote better. But, this blatant error. correct translation Hebrew indeed treasury, which also makes perfect sense Zechariah\'s context, whereas potter\'s field totally unrelated. Whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation. However, given Matthew\'s track record, finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty. course, Matthew would have ample reason altering text. thirty pieces silver match Judas\'s situation, most Christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy toss around. However, correct translation Zechariah directly contradicts situation with Judas high priests. high priests would money treasury. worthless shepherd Zechariah does exactly opposite! course, average Thursday-Night Bible student, prophecy presented Matthew would taken Testament face value. those, Matthew\'s work convincing enough. Wine, Vinegar, Casting Lots: Then, Jesus away crucified. 27.34-35] ...they gave vinegar drink, mingled with gall- when tasted would drink And, when they crucified him, they divided garments among them casting lots: that might fulfilled what spoken prophet, They parted garments among them, upon vesture they cast lots. First all, vinegar offered Jesus actually common sour wine, type that Roman soldiers drank regularly. find that right before Jesus dies, soldiers themselves give some drink --not polluted with gall. 19.28-30] Jesus... said, thirst. bowl vinegar stood there, they sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth. When received vinegar, said, finished- But, Matthew seems drawing passage from prophets, from Psalms. 69.20-28] looked pity, there none- comforters, found none. They gave poison food (lit. they gall meat), thirst, they gave vinegar drink... them punishment upon punishment, they have acquittal from thee. them blotted Book Living. course, sour wine offered Jesus done request drink. This does indeed seem show pity. psalm quoted about David political military enemies. about messiah Jesus. then surprising that into further problem when that Jesus psalm asks G\'d damnation crucifiers, whereas Jesus gospels says, 23.34] Jesus said, Father, forgive them, don\'t know what they Further, Matthew misses with attempt create prophecy having gall bitter substance) into Jesus\'s drink, meat, psalm stipulates. With prophecy vinegar faulty, naturally ask, What casting lots? This brings 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion itself. Suffice that fact that Jesus\'s clothes were divided told great thing. turns that this happened often felon those days. will soon see, perhaps least erroneous passage psalm when applied Jesus. does indeed bring interesting question quality Jesus\'s clothes. removed from worldly possessions, ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises some suspicions. 22nd Psalm: This psalm attributed David, lament condition under attack enemies. becomes song praise YHVH hope. Taken context, parts seem plight Jesus crucifixion quite well. will examine primary passages. Verse 1-2: god, god! have forsaken me?! from helping from words groaning? god, day, don\'t answer, night, find rest. Jesus said have cried first sentence while cross. This suggests that whole psalm really about Jesus, rather than king David. course, rest first stanza does nicely Jesus execution. Jesus pictured complaining about whole ordeal, supposed like lamb mute before shearers. Indeed, Jesus doesn\'t much groaning, even when cross. certainly does both night cross. 6-8: But, worm, man-- scorned men... mock They make faces their heads- committed cause YHVH. deliver him... delights him. This seems Jesus\'s execution pretty well, with exception Holy messiah being called worm. 12-13: Many bulls encompass me... they open their mouths widely like ravening roaring lion. 16-18: Yea, dogs round about company evildoers encir-cle they have pierced hands feet. bones... They divide garments among them, cast lost raiment. 19-21: you, YHVH, away! ...Deliver soul from sword, life from power dog! Save from mouth lion, afflicted soul from horns wild bull! would seem quite convincing, I\'m sure early Christian fathers wrote this prophecy thought too. Unfortunately, this prophecy fatal flaw. words have pierced really exist psalm. correct Hebrew translation Yea, dogs round about company evildoers encircles like lion, they hands feet... Hebrew phrase like lion very rare verb form which mean pierced differ phonetic character. word Hebrew text literally, like lion (ka\'ari), which makes sense context, even further fits animal imagery employed psalm writer. convenience that would urge Christian change word ka\'aru. But, needed (yet artificial) weight prophecy this just what Christian translators have chosen While correct translation does eliminate psalm from referring Jesus, absence does much honesty translators. Apart from erroneous verse psalm does lend itself Jesus easily. Verse speaks sufferer being saved from sword rather than cross. This naturally fits psalm\'s true subject, king David. side note, know that crucifixions pierce hands, palms, rather forearms. This doesn\'t much favour traditional thought resurrected Jesus showing disciples scars palms. then, facts aren\'t bound religious beliefs. Matthew escapes culpability this time, does attempt draw many direct links between this psalm lord Jesus. psalm, like many others, minds gospel writers when they compiled stories interpretations Jesus\'s life death. much these scriptures have contributed what actually written down question that serious repercussions Christian theology. easy see, those faithful fundamentalists, some events Testament might have been enhanced scribes such eager Matthew. But, does less speculate than simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims. far, this said good things Matthew. reference piercing looks like Jesus\'s crucifixion. John\'s gospel recount, written about years after fact, tells Jesus\'s execution, 19.34,37] soldiers pierced side with spear, came blood water... these things took place that Scripture fulfilled... will look whom they\'ve pierced. course, this built passage taken blatantly context. Prophet Zechariah tells much nation Israel will split from Jerusalem Judah with them. 12.7-10] YHVH will give victory Judah... that day, will seek destroy nations that come against Jerusalem Judah). will pour spirit compassion supplication... Jerusalem that when they look they have pierced, they will mourn, weep bitterly over like weep over firstborn child. John\'s attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker that Matthew\'s attempts. Matthew, least, usually excontexts more than just passage. John\'s errors grossly obvious blatant here. does speak well gospel writers, helps show prophetic aspects their religion were founded. Reckoned with Transgressors: After arrest, Jesus quickly executed claiming Jewish kingship, messiahship. According version gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with thieves. 15.27] with they crucified robbers, right, left. scripture fulfilled which says, reckoned with transgressors. Here, Mark trying link Jesus passage Isaiah about servant nation Israel. passage about messiah, reads whole chapter Isaiah surrounding chapters, sees that servant nation. verses also about what this servant gone through past, prediction what come, event. servant thought criminal. This also happens description Jesus. passage really been about messiah, still clear executing Jesus between thieves would fulfill prophecy Isaiah. Jesus would more fittingly fulfill with whole ministry. considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career. Locking onto single event rather poor steal prophecy, least this case, that Mark could have made better analogy with general comparisons. Mark goes tell those were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him. [15.32] This expected from couple robbers. course later recount, Luke decides change some things. Luke tells 23.39-43] criminals hanged with railed, Aren\'t messiah?! Save yourself, This certainly fits with Mark\'s recount, which tells people crucified Jesus said, Save yourself! that robbers same. then Luke goes other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying, Don\'t fear G\'d, since under same sentence condemnation? indeed justly receiving reward deeds. But, this done nothing wrong. said, Jesus, remember when come your kingdom. Jesus answered, Verily you, today will with paradise. Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived. stretches imagination this picture ruffian rebuking fellow criminal with such eloquent speech. have rather strange picture criminal lamenting over goodness punishment justness suffering. Such man, apparently noble principle, doesn\'t seem likely have been robber. wonder amount theatrics created Luke. course, Luke\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\'s. Luke only criminal revile Jesus, both. easy enough discount discrepancy because account made those wish believe part error free words G\'d have this avenue open. This another example writer trying take Testament passage expand reinterpret suit theology. this case, embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, have seen. World-- comes perhaps most extraordinary embarrassing passages Testament. found three synoptic gospel stories, casts some most unfavourable doubt whole theory Christianity. Jesus mentions destruction Jewish temples buildings, disciples about this, about world which been warning about. disciples: Tell when will this [the temple\'s destruction] what will sign your coming, close age? Jesus: Take care that leads astray, many will come name, saying, christ. ...you will hear wars rumours wars... this must take place, yet. For, nation will rise against nation... this beginning birthpangs. They will deliver up... death, false prophets will arise lead many astray. ...But endures will saved. This gospel will preached throughout whole world, testimony nations, then will come. when desolation spoken prophet Daniel, ...let those Judea flee mountains. Immediately after tribulation those days, will darkened... stars will fall from heaven... then will appear sign heaven, tribes earth will mourn, coming... will send angels... gather elect... Learn lesson tree: soon branch becomes tender puts forth leaves, know that summer near. also, when these things, will know that near, very gate. Truly you, this generation will pass away until these things take place... But, hour, knows- angels, Son, only Father... Therefore, also must ready, coming hour expect. From this, clear that Jesus thought world would within lifetimes least some disciples. tells them that although doesn\'t know exact hour, that will come, thus they must ready. Theologians have their pants panic find some this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself explicit. told disciples that their generation would still around End, that they particular should prepare prepare swept away. There have been some resorted removing inerrant nature Bible, said that phrase, this generation shall pass away... really means this race people will pass away... course, word generation used many times refer exactly that, generation disciples. interesting notion that when decided learn Greek, didn\'t learn well enough make himself clear. But. quite obvious from rest dialogue that disciples least some them) supposed live World. charge mistranslation completely blown away looking Apostles\' responses. becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, Peter 4.7, John 2.18, Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what said. very near. 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter Matthew, ignored meaning altogether. 2,000 years, they have waited their executed leader come back, hearing wars, rumours wars, sure that coming soon. Surely must must wait. imagine tired must sitting around there, being holy, waiting just right moment spring? shortly after crucifixion, Jesus Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died. said that after three days, three days three nights, three periods time, three eternal seconds --or three whatever they decide makes less trouble-- seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance. Then Saviour decided wasn\'t best interests religion stick around, therefore disappeared from sight into heaven. story goes, anyway. been seen, there were many things attributed Jesus when people around writing gospel stories down. them, Jesus fulfiller prophecy scripture. have seen, though, that this matter quite shaky. But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast faith, simple belief. What doctrinal objections could solved with argumentation brute force, faith forgetfulness kept away from question. question investigate never been easiest treat matters. Thus 2,000 years, prophecies cited Testament have gone largely accepted. Things well continue that some time. Pausing moment consider doctrines Christianity have been accepted used (properly improperly) support wars persecution, suppose there prophecy which Christianity securely keep hold.';0

Let\'s step back consider functionality want: microgravity/vacuum process research life sciences research (adaptation space) spacecraft maintenence NASA approach, explified Shuttle far, centralize functionality. These projects failed meet their targets wide margin: military commercial users took most their payloads Shuttle after wasting much effort their payloads crumbled into disorganization miscommunication. Over billion been spent these projects with reduction launch costs littel improvement commercial space industrialization. Meanwhile, military commercial users have come with superior strategy space development: constellation. Firstly, different functions broken down into different constellations placed optimal orbit each function: thus have GPS/Navstar constellation 12-hour orbits, comsats Clarke Molniya orbits, etc. Secondly, task distributed amongst several spacecraft constellation, providing redundancy full coverage where needed. SSF\'s main functions require quite different environments also prime candidates constellization. have makings microgravity constellation now: COMET long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab short-duration flights. best strategy this area inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation U.S. facilities Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, transition from Shuttle/Spacelab much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET SSTO/SIF/COMET. might also expand research program take advantage interesting space environments, high-radiation Allen belt gas/plasma gradients comet tails. COMET system much more easily retrofitted these tasks, where station large affordably launch beyond LEO. need study life sciences just microgravity, also lunar Martian gravities, radiation environments deep space instead protected shelter LEO. This very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical space program until costs come down orders magnitude. Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts scope investigation, sample size. propose LabRatSat, constellation tether-bolo satellites that test various levels gravity super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that representative radiation environment encountered Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips. miniaturized life support machinery might operated real-time from earth thru interface. AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons LDEFs lunar Martian surface, testing actual environment cost before $billions spent astronauts. largest market spacecraft servicing Clarke orbit. propose fleet small teleoperated robots small test satellites which ground engineers practice their skills. Once place, robots stuck solar arrays antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc. Once fleet working, spun commercial company(s) work with comsat companies develop comsat replaceable module standards. applying successful constellation strategy, getting failed centralized strategy SSF, have radically improved capability program while greatly cutting cost. fraction SSF\'s pricetag, satellites where satellites are, study life\'s adaptation much large more representative variety space environments, microgravity vacuum research inexpensively and, needed, special-purpose orbits.

Standard low-cost microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration clock synchronization. ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus communication protocol composed three levels: Protocol, Base Protocol, Application Protocol. PROTOCOL: This simple efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data. provides cooperative synchronization partners with different clock rates. transactions include addressing, framing bits into bytes, byte acknowledgment receiver. BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes asymmetrical interconnect between host computer multiple peripherals. host becomes ACCESS.bus manager. Base Protocol defines format ACCESS.bus message envelope, which transaction with additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features Base Protocol auto-addressing plugging. Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique addresses, without need setting jumpers switches. plugging ability attach detach devices while system running, without rebooting. APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This highest level ACCESS.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific particular types devices. Each type requires different Application Protocol. Three broad device types have been identified: keyboards, locators, text devices.

Now, there goals: move DistortedData(x,y) Reference(x,y) keep Length(e) measured from current (x,y)\'s) close possible DigitizedLength(e) measured using digitized (x,y)\'s). every point, compute displacement based example: (x,y) points which know Reference(x,y), move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) Current(x,y)). This will slowly move DistortedReference(x,y) towards Reference(x,y). other points, examine current length each edge. each edge, compute displacement which would make that edge correct length (where correct DigitizedLength). Take vector these edge displacements, move point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements. This will keep triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh. Iterate until happy (for example, point moves very much). alpha0 alpha1 need determined experimentation. Consider much believe Reference(x,y) i.e., absolutely insist final points exactly matching References, want balance some error matching Reference against changes length edges.

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group, original name committee that wrote standard. JPEG designed compressing either full-color gray-scale digital images natural, real-world scenes. does work well non-realistic images, such cartoons line drawings. JPEG does handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, does handle motion picture compression. Standards compressing those types images being worked other committees, named JBIG MPEG respectively. JPEG lossy, meaning that image decompression isn\'t quite identical what originally algorithm achieves much compression exploiting known limitations human eye, notably fact that small color details aren\'t perceived well small details light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG intended compressing images that will looked humans. plan machine-analyze your images, small errors introduced JPEG problem you, even they invisible eye. useful property JPEG that degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters. This means that image maker trade file size against output image quality. make *extremely* small files don\'t mind poor quality- this useful indexing image archives, making thumbnail views icons, etc. etc. Conversely, aren\'t happy with output quality default compression setting, jack quality until satisfied, accept lesser compression. JPEG? There good reasons: make your image files smaller, store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller transmitting files across networks archiving libraries images. Being able compress Mbyte full-color file down Kbytes makes difference disk space transmission time! comparing JPEG, size ratio more like four one. More details below.) your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly, you\'ll have convert JPEG some other format viewing manipulating images. Even with JPEG-capable viewer, takes longer decode view JPEG image than view image simpler format (GIF, instance). Thus, using JPEG essentially time/space tradeoff: give some time order store transmit image more cheaply. It\'s worth noting that when network phone transmission involved, time savings from transferring shorter file much greater than extra time decompress file. I\'ll arithmetic yourself. other reason JPEG will gradually replace standard Usenet posting format that JPEG store full color information: bits/pixel million colors) instead less (256 fewer colors). have only 8-bit display hardware then this seem like much advantage you. Within couple years, though, 8-bit will look obsolete black-and-white MacPaint format does today. Furthermore, reasons detailed section JPEG more useful than exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG considerably more appropriate than Usenet posting standard. When should JPEG, when should stick with GIF? JPEG *not* going displace entirely- some types images, superior image quality, file size, both. first things learn about JPEG which kinds images apply rule thumb, JPEG superior storing full-color gray-scale images realistic scenes- that means scanned photographs similar material. JPEG superior even don\'t have 24-bit display hardware, superior (See section details.) does significantly better images with only distinct colors, such cartoons line drawings. particular, large areas pixels that *exactly* same color compressed very efficiently indeed GIF. JPEG can\'t squeeze these files much does without introducing visible defects. This sort image best kept form. particular, single-color borders quite cheap files, they should avoided JPEG files.) JPEG also hard time with very sharp edges: pure-black pixels adjacent pure-white pixels, example. Sharp edges tend come blurred unless very high quality setting. Again, this sort thing found scanned photographs, shows fairly often files: borders, overlaid text, etc. blurriness particularly objectionable with text that\'s only pixels high. have with small-size overlaid text, don\'t JPEG Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, instance) usually fall between scanned images cartoons terms complexity. more complex subtly rendered image, more likely that JPEG will well same goes semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never converted JPEG. need least about gray levels before JPEG useful gray-scale images. should also noted that lossless gray-scale images levels, while JPEG not. have existing library images, wonder whether should convert them JPEG. will lose little image quality (Section which argues that JPEG image quality superior GIF, only applies both formats start from full-color original. start from GIF, you\'ve already irretrievably lost great deal information- JPEG only make things worse.) However, disk space savings justify converting anyway.

There seems widespread confusion about meaning these settings. Quality does mean keep 95\% information, some have claimed. quality scale purely arbitrary- it\'s percentage anything. name game using JPEG pick lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into image indistinguishable from original. This setting will vary from image another from observer another, here some rules thumb. default quality setting very often best choice. This setting about lowest without expecting defects typical image. first- defects, then Except experimental purposes, never above saying will produce file three times large hardly better quality. image less than perfect quality begin with, might able down without objectionable degradation. other hand, might need HIGHER quality setting avoid further degradation. second case seems apply much time when converting GIFs JPEG. default about right compressing 24-bit images, usually better converting GIFs (see section more info). want very small file (say preview indexing purposes) prepared tolerate large defects, setting range about right. amusing art. (Note: quality settings discussed this article apply free JPEG software described section many programs based Other JPEG implementations, such Image Alchemy, completely different quality scale. Some programs don\'t even provide numeric scale, just high/medium/low-style choices.) Where JPEG software? Most programs described this section available FTP. don\'t know FTP, article find sources. don\'t have direct access FTP, read about ftpmail servers same article.) That article appears regularly news.answers, sending e-mail mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources body. Anonymous List also helpful it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq news.answers archive. NOTE: this list changes constantly. have copy more than couple months old, latest JPEG from news.answers archive. [6A] looking canned software, viewers, etc: first part this list system-specific programs that only kind system. don\'t what want your machine, check portable JPEG software described list. Note that this list concentrates free shareware programs that obtain over Internet- some commercial programs listed too. Windows: (shareware, $25) excellent viewer JPEG, GIF, many other image formats. also format conversion some simple image manipulations. It\'s available from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z. Version 3.00 major upgrade with support 24-bit displays many other improvements- however, brand still some bugs lurking. prefer bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export. Note that version 2.21 good choice have 24-bit display (you\'ll only 8-bit color), converting 24-bit images JPEG. 2.21 works fine converting other 8-bit images JPEG. CAUTION: there glitch version 2.21: sure check save normal size checkbox when saving JPEG file, file will blurry. Another good choice Windows John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing conversion tasks. ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly- colormapped displays, does better (though slower) color quantization than basic free JPEG software. Both above large, complex packages. just want simple image viewer, xloadimage xli. xloadimage supports JPEG latest release, 3.03. xloadimage free available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z. variant version xloadimage, said fans somewhat faster more robust than original. (The current indeed faster more robust than current xloadimage, least with respect JPEG files, because decoder while xloadimage 3.03 using hacked-over next xloadimage release will this.) also free available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs said right thing with 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS- Windows OS/2 programs, next headings. good choice Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG files. current version, 2.5, available from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. This good basic viewer that works either 386/486 machines. user interface flashy, it\'s functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview. current version, 1.2, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires better VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 386MAX work- Windows OS/2 not). Hiview currently fastest viewer images that bigger than your screen. larger images, scales image down screen (rather than using panning/scrolling most viewers do). prefer this approach, there\'s denying that slows down loading large images considerably. Note: installation tricky- read directions carefully! shareware alternative ColorView ($30). This easier install than either freeware alternatives. user interface also much spiffier-looking, although personally find harder more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. faster than DVPEG little slower than Hiview, least hardware. (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG ColorView seem about same speed, both faster than Hiview.) current version 2.1, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires VESA graphics driver- don\'t have one, look vesadrv2.zip vesa-tsr.zip from same directory. (Many recent have built-in VESA driver, don\'t load VESA driver unless ColorView complains that driver missing.) second shareware alternative Fullview, which been kicking around while, don\'t know stable archive location current (rather old) version inferior above viewers anyway. author tells that version Fullview will shortly will submitted Simtel20 archives that time. well-known viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half speed above viewers) image quality poor except hi-color displays. it\'d have been nice good JPEG capability CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. remarkable variety graphics hardware, these viewers might work your particular machine. can\'t *any* them work, you\'ll need following conversion programs convert JPEG GIF, then view with your favorite viewer. have hi-color hardware, don\'t intermediate format- find TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 reputed right thing with hi-color displays.) Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters FTPable from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip jpeg4386.zip have extended memory). These files compilations free source code described section they will convert JPEG from GIF, Targa, formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These slow limited conversion from format- particular, can\'t 24-bit color output from JPEG. major advantage these tools that they will read write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format well Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files rather widespread BBSes, this useful capability.

NOTE: format files posted Internet, since readable non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also shareware image conversion manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF formats) from many other image formats. also display images. demo version Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: Internet\'s archive site PC-related programs Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).

Requires Windows 256-or-more-colors mode. This no-frills viewer with habit hogging machine completely while decodes- image quality noticeably worse than other viewers. it\'s fast you\'ll anyway, least previewing... JView freeware, fairly fast, good on-line help, write decompressed image Windows format- can\'t create JPEG files, doesn\'t view GIFs. JView also lacks some other useful features shareware viewers (such brightness adjustment), it\'s excellent basic viewer. current version, 0.9, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors this archive found some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, image files- write these formats too, used converter. some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment slideshow. current version 2.1, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This slow 286-compatible version- register, you\'ll 386-only version, which roughly 25\% faster.) ColorView another shareware entry ($30).

With respect JPEG, marginally faster considerably less prone crash when corrupt JPEG file. However, some applications seem have compatibility problems with 1.5.) users should keep mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, same Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section details.) post images Usenet, make sure they JFIF format. Most programs mentioned below generate either format. first choice probably JPEGView, free program viewing images that JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, format. also convert between JPEG formats. current version, 2.0, improvement over prior versions. from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System QuickTime. 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces best color image quality currently available JPEG viewers. JPEGView view large images much less memory than other viewers- fact, it\'s only that deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels typical Mac. Given large image, JPEGView automatically scales down screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (You zoom desired portion, though.) Some people like this behavior, some don\'t. Overall, JPEGView\'s user interface very well thought out. GIFConverter, shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF PICT/JPEG, well several other image formats. latest version 2.3.2. from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 later. GIFConverter better than JPEGView plain JPEG/GIF viewer, much more extensive image manipulation format conversion capabilities, find worth shareware playing around with images. Also, newest version GIFConverter load save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, your best your machine QuickTime. (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: GIFConverter runs memory trying load large JPEG, converting file with JPEG Convert, then viewing version.

Requires QuickTime. PictPixie intended developer\'s tool, it\'s really best choice unless like fool around with QuickTime. Some drawbacks that requires lots memory, produces relatively poor color image quality anything less than 24-bit display, relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie unsupported program, meaning some minor bugs that Apple does intend fix. (There version PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around net. have this should trash it\'s even buggier. Also, QuickTime Starter includes much cleaned-up descendant PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note that Picture Compressor free distributed net.)

Most people don\'t have full-color pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores fewer bits pixel, display fewer distinct colors time. display full-color image, computer must image into appropriate representative colors. This process called color quantization. (This something misnomer, color selection would better term. We\'re stuck with standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization lossy process. turns that most images, details color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact final image quality than errors introduced JPEG (except very lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG full-color format, converting color JPEG image display 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This true *all* color JPEGs: even feed 256-or-less-color into JPEG, what comes decompressor *not* colors, thousands colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel little differently, pixels that started with identical colors will probably come with slightly different colors. Each original color gets smeared into group nearby colors. Therefore quantization always required display color JPEG colormapped display, regardless image source. only avoid quantization gray-scale output. (Incidentally, because this effect it\'s nearly meaningless talk about number colors used JPEG image. Even attempted count number distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give different results because roundoff error differences. occasionally posted images described 256-color JPEG. This tells that poster hasn\'t read this probably converted JPEG from GIF. JPEGs classified color gray-scale (just like photographs), number colors just isn\'t useful concept JPEG.) other hand, image definition already been quantized fewer colors. *does* have definite number colors palette, format doesn\'t allow more than palette entries.) purposes Usenet picture distribution, advantage that sender precomputes color quantization, recipients don\'t have This also *disadvantage* GIF: you\'re stuck with sender\'s quantization. sender quantized different number colors than what display, have re-quantize, resulting much poorer image quality than quantized once from full-color image. Furthermore, sender didn\'t high-quality color quantization algorithm, you\'re luck. this reason, JPEG offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines don\'t match sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image quantized precisely match user\'s display hardware. Furthermore, will able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms (there active research this area), purchase better display hardware, better view JPEG images already have. With GIF, you\'re stuck forevermore with what sent. It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. view 256-color 16-color display, example, probably getting much worse image than need This partly inevitable consequence doing color quantizations (one create GIF, display it), often it\'s also sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs will forced high quality quantizers order acceptable results all, normal they will quantize directly number colors displayed. Thus, JPEG likely provide better results than average program low-color-resolution displays well high-resolution ones! Finally, ever-growing number people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color displays, true 24-bit displays workstations Macintoshes, etc. these people, already obsolete, cannot represent image full capabilities their display. JPEG images drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG all-around better choice than representing images machine-independent fashion. does JPEG work? buzz-words know chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, Huffman arithmetic entropy coding. This article\'s long enough already, I\'m going more than that here. technical information, comp.compression FAQ. This available from news.answers archive rtfm.mit.edu, files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. need help using news.answers archive, this article. What about lossless JPEG? There\'s great deal confusion this subject. JPEG committee define truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., that guarantees final output bit-for-bit identical original input. However, this lossless mode almost nothing common with regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, offers much less compression. present, very implementations lossless JPEG exist, them commercial. Saying free JPEG software DOES lossless image. What does deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step. There still good deal information loss color subsampling step. (With free JPEG code, also -sample turn subsampling. Keep mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with resulting file.) Even with both quantization subsampling turned off, regular JPEG algorithm lossless, because subject roundoff errors various calculations. maximum error counts pixel value- it\'s highly unlikely that this could perceived human eye, might concern doing machine processing image. this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that perhaps half size uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly same amount compression, guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. have application requiring lossless storage images with less than bits pixel (per color component), want look into JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better than JPEG lossless such images. JPEG lossless superior JBIG images with more bits pixel- furthermore, JPEG public domain least with Huffman back end), while JBIG techniques heavily covered patents. [10] argument about file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only family compression algorithms- does *not* refer specific image file format. JPEG committee prevented from defining file format turf wars within international standards organizations. Since can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless agree common file format, this leaves with problem. absence official standards, number JPEG program writers have just gone their thing, result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s. closest thing have de-facto standard JPEG format some work that\'s been coordinated people C-Cube Microsystems. They have defined JPEG-based file formats: JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), low-end format that transports pixels much else. TIFF/JPEG, TIFF 6.0, extension Aldus TIFF format. TIFF high-end format that will record just about everything ever wanted know about image, more besides :-). TIFF more complex than JFIF, well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different incompatible subsets TIFF. It\'s likely that adding JPEG will anything improve this situation. Both these formats were developed with input from major vendors JPEG-related products- it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere both standards. believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF replacement picture postings. JFIF simpler than TIFF available now- TIFF spec only recently been officially adopted, still unusably vague some crucial details. Even when TIFF/JPEG well defined, JFIF format likely widely supported lowest common denominator- TIFF/JPEG files never transportable. particular case that people interested Apple\'s QuickTime software Macintosh. QuickTime uses JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion between JFIF QuickTime JPEG pretty straightforward, several programs available (see portion section 6A). have editor that handles binary files, strip QuickTime JPEG PICT down JFIF hand- section details. Another particular case Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF Image Alchemy). These programs capable reading writing JFIF format. default, though, they write proprietary format developed HSI. This format readable non-HSI programs should used Usenet postings. switch JFIF output. (This applies versions these programs- current releases emit JFIF format default. still should careful post HSI-format files, unless want flamed people non-PC platforms.)

Portions file look like plain JPEG data, they won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

JPEG spec defines different back modules final output compressed data: either Huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed. choice impact image quality, arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file. typical images, arithmetic coding produces file percent smaller than Huffman coding. (All file-size numbers previously cited Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, particular variant arithmetic coding specified JPEG standard subject patents owned IBM, AT&T, Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally arithmetic coding* unless obtain licenses from these companies. (The fair doctrine allows people implement test algorithm, actually storing images with dubious best.) least short run, recommend that people worry about arithmetic coding- space savings isn\'t great enough justify potential legal hassles. particular, arithmetic coding *should not* used images exchanged Usenet. There some small chance that legal situation change future. Stay tuned further details. [13] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? would nice having compressed image with JPEG, could decompress manipulate (crop border, say), recompress without further image degradation beyond what lost initially. Unfortunately THIS CASE. general, recompressing altered image loses more information, though usually much lost first time around. next best thing would that decompress image recompress *without changing then there further loss, i.e., identical JPEG file. Even this true- least, with current free JPEG software. It\'s essentially problem accumulation roundoff error. repeatedly compress decompress, image will eventually degrade where visible changes from first-generation output. usually takes many such cycles visible change.) things to-do list accumulation error avoided limited, optimistic about case, most that could possibly guaranteed would that compressing unmodified full-color output djpeg, original quality setting, would introduce further loss. Even such simple changes cropping border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. you\'re wondering why, it\'s because pixel-block boundaries move. cropped only multiples pixels, might safe, that\'s mighty limited capability!) bottom line that JPEG useful format archival storage transmission images, don\'t want intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps. lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working image, then JPEG when ready file away. Aside from avoiding degradation, will save compression/decompression time this :-). [14] What some rules thumb converting images JPEG? stated earlier, *will* lose some amount image information convert existing image JPEG. obtain original full-color data made from, it\'s better make JPEG from that. need save space have only work from, here some suggestions getting maximum space savings with minimum loss quality. first rule when converting library look each JPEG, make sure happy with before throwing away corresponding GIF- that will give chance re-do conversion with higher quality setting necessary. Some GIFs better left GIFs, explained section particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen fewer colors don\'t convert well. find that JPEG file reasonable quality will *larger* than GIF. check sizes too.) Experience date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs best candidates conversion JPEG. They chew most storage offer most potential savings, they convert JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting much under Kbytes. Also, don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs small those created directly from full-color originals. maintain image quality have converted files much twice straight-through JPEG files would (i.e., shoot 1/3rd size file, 1/4th suggested earlier comparisons). Many people have developed habit putting large constant-color border around image. While useless, this nearly free terms storage cost files. free JPEG files, sharp border boundary create visible artifacts (ghost edges). yourself favor crop border before JPEGing. Windows system, XV\'s manual automatic cropping functions very painless this.) cjpeg\'s default setting appropriate full-color input, inputs, settings often seem necessary avoid image degradation. apply smoothing suggested below, higher setting necessary.) Color GIFs photographs complex artwork usually dithered fool your into seeing more than colors that actually store. enlarge image, will that adjacent pixels often significantly different colors- normal size averages these pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value. trouble with dithering that, JPEG, looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise- JPEG can\'t compress noise very well. resulting JPEG file both larger lower image quality than what would have gotten from JPEGing original full color image it). around this, want smooth image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating color that thought anyway, process getting rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble. Appropriate smoothing will often avoid using high factor, thus further reducing size compressed file, while still obtaining better-looking output image than you\'d without smoothing. With free JPEG software products based it), simple smoothing capability built -smooth when converting GIFs. Values seem work well high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering require larger smoothing factors. regular fine-scale patterns image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing definitely called for.) large smoothing factor will blur output image, which don\'t want. image processing wizard, also smoothing with separate filtering program, such pnmconvol from PBMPLUS package.

INTRODUCTION From small world have gazed upon cosmic ocean untold thousands years. Ancient astronomers observed points light that appeared move among stars. They called these objects planets, meaning wanderers, named them after Roman deities Jupiter, king gods- Mars, war- Mercury, messenger gods- Venus, love beauty, Saturn, father Jupiter agriculture. stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, meteors shooting stars apparently falling from sky. Science flourished during European Renaissance. Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered, orbits planets around were calculated. 17th century, astronomers pointed device called telescope heavens made startling discoveries. years since 1959 have amounted golden solar system exploration. Advancements rocketry after World enabled machines break grip Earth\'s gravity travel Moon other planets. United States sent automated spacecraft, then human-crewed expeditions, explore Moon. automated machines have orbited landed Venus Mars- explored Sun\'s environment- observed comets, made close-range surveys while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus Neptune. These travelers brought quantum leap knowledge understanding solar system. Through electronic sight other senses automated spacecraft, color complexion have been given worlds that centuries appeared Earth-bound eyes fuzzy disks indistinct points light. dozens previously unknown objects have been discovered. Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through solar system some most remarkable achievements 20th century. AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT National Aeronautics Space Administration\'s (NASA\'s) automated spacecraft solar system exploration come many shapes sizes. While they designed fulfill separate specific mission objectives, craft share much common. Each spacecraft consists various scientific instruments selected particular mission, supported basic subsystems electrical power, trajectory orientation control, well processing data communicating with Earth. Electrical power required operate spacecraft instruments systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays photovoltaic cells small nuclear generators power solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries employed backup supplemental power. Imagine that spacecraft successfully journeyed millions miles through space time near planet, only have cameras other sensing instruments pointed wrong speeds past target! help prevent such mishap, subsystem small thrusters used control spacecraft. thrusters linked with devices that maintain constant gaze selected stars. Just Earth\'s early seafarers used stars navigate oceans, spacecraft stars maintain their bearings space. With subsystem locked onto fixed points reference, flight controllers keep spacecraft\'s scientific instruments pointed target body craft\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. thrusters also used fine-tune flight path speed spacecraft ensure that target body encountered planned distance proper trajectory. Between 1959 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched study Moon solar environment- they also scanned inner planets other than Earth Mercury, Venus Mars. These three worlds, own, known terrestrial planets because they share solid-rock composition. early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA employed highly successful series spacecraft called Mariners. Their flights helped shape planning later missions. Between 1962 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted first surveys planetary neighbors space. Mariners used solar panels their primary power source. first final versions spacecraft wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies. Although Mariners ranged from Mariner Venus spacecraft, weighing kilograms (447 pounds), Mariner Mars Orbiter, weighing kilograms (2,147 pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout program. Mariner Venus spacecraft, example, originally been backup Mariner Mars flyby. Mariner spacecraft sent Venus Mercury used components left over from Mariner Mars Orbiter program. 1972, NASA launched Pioneer Jupiter spacecraft. Interest shifting four outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus Neptune giant balls dense quite different from terrestrial worlds already surveyed. Four NASA spacecraft Pioneers Voyagers were sent 1970s tour outer regions solar system. Because distances involved, these travelers took anywhere from months years reach their destinations. Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become first human artifacts journey distant stars. Because Sun\'s light becomes faint outer solar system, these travelers solar power instead operate electricity generated heat from decay radioisotopes. NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft revisit neighbors Mars Venus middle late 1970s. Twin Viking Landers were equipped serve seismic weather stations biology laboratories. advanced orbiters descendants Mariner craft carried Viking Landers from Earth then studied martian features from above. drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus 1978. Pioneer Venus Orbiter equipped with radar instrument that allowed through planet\'s dense cloud cover study surface features. Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through clouds. probes main body which contained scientific instruments radioed information about planet\'s atmosphere during their descent toward surface. generation automated spacecraft including Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) Cassini being developed sent into solar system make detailed examinations that will increase understanding neighborhood planet. discussion objects solar system must start with Sun. dwarfs other bodies, representing approximately 99.86 percent mass solar system- planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust only about 0.14 percent.

After billion years giant, will suddenly collapse into white dwarf final product star like ours. take trillion years cool completely. Many spacecraft have explored Sun\'s environment, none have gotten closer surface than approximately two-thirds distance from Earth Sun. Pioneers 5-11, Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers other spacecraft have sampled solar environment. Ulysses spacecraft, launched October 1990, joint solar mission NASA European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\'s gravity change trajectory, Ulysses will over Sun\'s polar regions during 1994 1995 will perform wide range studies using nine onboard scientific instruments. fortunate that exactly were different almost way, life would almost certainly never have developed Earth. Mercury Obtaining first close-up views Mercury primary objective Mariner spacecraft, launched November 1973, from Kennedy Space Center Florida. After journey nearly five months, which included flyby Venus, spacecraft passed within kilometers (437 miles) solar system\'s innermost planet March 1974. Until Mariner little known about Mercury. Even best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury indistinct object lacking surface detail. planet close that usually lost solar glare. When planet visible Earth\'s horizon just after sunset before dawn, obscured haze dust atmosphere. Only radar telescopes gave hint Mercury\'s surface conditions prior voyage Mariner photographs Mariner radioed back Earth revealed ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling Moon. pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing planet. These apparently were created when Mercury\'s interior cooled shrank, buckling planet\'s crust. cliffs high kilometers miles) long kilometers (310 miles). Instruments Mariner discovered that Mercury weak magnetic field trace atmosphere trillionth density Earth\'s atmosphere composed chiefly argon, neon helium. When planet\'s orbit takes closest Sun, surface temperatures range from degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit) Mercury\'s sunlit side -183 degrees Celsius (-298 degrees Fahrenheit) dark side. This range surface temperature degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) largest single body solar system. Mercury literally bakes freezes same time. Days nights long Mercury. combination slow rotation relative stars Earth days) rapid revolution around Earth days) means that Mercury solar takes Earth days Mercury years time takes innermost planet complete orbits around Sun! Mercury appears have crust light silicate rock like that Earth. Scientists believe Mercury heavy iron-rich core making slightly less than half volume. That would make Mercury\'s core larger, proportionally, than Moon\'s core those planets. After initial Mercury encounter, Mariner made additional flybys September 1974, March 1975 before control used orient spacecraft exhausted mission concluded. Each flyby took place same local Mercury time when identical half planet illuminated- result, still have seen one-half planet\'s surface. Venus Veiled dense cloud cover, Venus nearest planetary neighbor first planet explored. Mariner spacecraft, launched August 1962, first more than dozen successful American Soviet missions study mysterious planet. spacecraft flew orbited Venus, plunged into atmosphere gently landed Venus\' surface, romantic myths speculations about neighbor were laid rest. December 1962, Mariner passed within 34,839 kilometers (21,648 miles) Venus became first spacecraft scan another planet- onboard instruments measured Venus minutes. Mariner launched June 1967, flew much closer planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544 miles) Venus second American flyby, Mariner 5\'s instruments measured planet\'s magnetic field, ionosphere, radiation belts temperatures. Mercury, Mariner flew Venus transmitted ultraviolet pictures Earth showing cloud circulation patterns Venusian atmosphere. spring summer 1978, spacecraft were launched further unravel mysteries Venus. December same year, Pioneer Venus Orbiter became first spacecraft placed orbit around planet. Five days later, five separate components making second spacecraft Pioneer Venus Multiprobe entered Venusian atmosphere different locations above planet. four small, independent probes main body radioed atmospheric data back Earth during their descent toward surface. Although designed examine atmosphere, probes survived impact with surface continued transmit data another hour. Venus resembles Earth size, physical composition density more closely than other known planet. However, spacecraft have discovered significant differences well. example, Venus\' rotation (west east) retrograde (backward) compared east-to-west spin Earth most other planets. Approximately 96.5 percent Venus\' atmosphere times dense Earth\'s) carbon dioxide. principal constituent Earth\'s atmosphere nitrogen. Venus\' atmosphere acts like greenhouse, permitting solar radiation reach surface trapping heat that would ordinarily radiated back into space. result, planet\'s average surface temperature degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), enough melt lead. radio altimeter Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided first means seeing through planet\'s dense cloud cover determining surface features over almost entire planet. NASA\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched 1989, been orbit around Venus since August 1990. spacecraft uses radar-mapping techniques provide ultrahigh-resolution images surface. Magellan revealed landscape dominated volcanic features, faults impact craters. Huge areas surface show evidence multiple periods lava flooding with flows lying previous ones. elevated region named Ishtar Terra lava-filled basin large United States. this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, mountain size Mount Everest. Scarring mountain\'s flank 100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost features Venus named women- Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio Beta Regio exceptions.) Craters survive Venus perhaps million years because there water very little wind erosion. Extensive fault-line networks cover planet, probably result same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics Earth. Venus surface temperature sufficient weaken rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing formation major plates large earthquake faults like Andreas Fault California. Venus\' predominant weather pattern high-altitude, high-speed circulation clouds that contain sulfuric acid. speeds reaching high kilometers (225 miles) hour, clouds circle planet only four Earth days. circulation same direction west east Venus\' slow rotation Earth days, whereas Earth\'s winds blow both directions west east east west alternating bands. Venus\' atmosphere serves simplified laboratory study weather. Earth viewed from space, world\'s distinguishing characteristics blue waters, brown green land masses white clouds. enveloped ocean consisting percent nitrogen, percent oxygen percent other constituents. only planet solar system known harbor life, Earth orbits average distance million kilometers million miles). Earth third planet from fifth largest solar system, with diameter just hundred kilometers larger than that Venus. planet\'s rapid spin molten nickel-iron core give rise extensive magnetic field, which, along with atmosphere, shields from nearly harmful radiation coming from other stars. Earth\'s atmosphere protects from meteors well, most which burn before they strike surface. Active geological processes have left evidence pelting Earth almost certainly received soon after formed about billion years ago. Along with other newly formed planets, showered space debris early days solar system. From journeys into space, have learned much about home planet. first American satellite Explorer launched from Cape Canaveral Florida January 1958, discovered intense radiation zone, called Allen radiation belts, surrounding Earth. Since then, other research satellites have revealed that planet\'s magnetic field distorted into tear-drop shape solar wind stream charged particles continuously ejected from Sun. We\'ve learned that magnetic field does fade into space definite boundaries. know that wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm uneventful, seethes with activity swelling contracting night. Affected changes solar activity, upper atmosphere contributes weather climate Earth. Besides affecting Earth\'s weather, solar activity gives rise dramatic visual phenomenon atmosphere. When charged particles from solar wind become trapped Earth\'s magnetic field, they collide with molecules above planet\'s magnetic poles. These molecules then begin glow known auroras northern southern lights. Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) space play major role daily local weather forecasting. These watchful electronic eyes warn dangerous storms. Continuous global monitoring provides vast amount useful data contributes better understanding Earth\'s complex weather systems. From their unique vantage points, satellites survey Earth\'s oceans, land resources, monitor planet\'s health. These eyes space have saved countless lives, provided tremendous conveniences shown that altering planet dangerous ways. Moon Moon Earth\'s single natural satellite. first human footsteps alien world were made American astronauts dusty surface airless, lifeless companion. preparation human-crewed Apollo expeditions, NASA dispatched automated Ranger, Surveyor Lunar Orbiter spacecraft study Moon between 1964 1968. NASA\'s Apollo program left large legacy lunar materials data. two-astronaut crews landed explored lunar surface between 1969 1972, carrying back collection rocks soil weighing total kilograms (842 pounds) consisting more than 2,000 separate samples. From this material other studies, scientists have constructed history Moon that includes infancy. Rocks collected from lunar highlands date about 4.0-4.3 billion years old. first million years Moon\'s existence were violent that traces this period remain. molten outer layer gradually cooled solidified into different kinds rock, Moon bombarded huge asteroids smaller objects. Some asteroids were large Rhode Island Delaware, their collisions with Moon created basins hundreds kilometers across. This catastrophic bombardment tapered approximately four billion years ago, leaving lunar highlands covered with huge, overlapping craters deep layer shattered broken rock. Heat produced decay radioactive elements began melt interior Moon depths about kilometers (125 miles) below surface. Then, next million years from about billion years lava rose from inside Moon. lava gradually spread over surface, flooding large impact basins form dark areas that Galileo Galilei, astronomer Italian Renaissance, called maria, meaning seas. tell, there been significant volcanic activity Moon more than three billion years. Since then, lunar surface been altered only micrometeorites, atomic particles from stars, rare impacts large meteorites spacecraft astronauts. astronauts landed Moon billion years ago, they would have seen landscape very similar today. Thousands years from now, footsteps left Apollo crews will remain sharp clear. origin Moon still mystery. Four theories attempt explanation: Moon formed near Earth separate body- torn from Earth- formed somewhere else captured planet\'s gravity, result collision between Earth asteroid about size Mars. last theory some good support from certain. Mars planets, Mars long been considered solar system\'s prime candidate harboring extraterrestrial life. Astronomers studying planet through telescopes what appeared straight lines crisscrossing surface. These observations later determined optical illusions popular notion that intelligent beings constructed system irrigation canals planet. 1938, when Orson Welles broadcast radio drama based science fiction classic Worlds H.G. Wells, enough people believed tale invading martians cause near panic. Another reason scientists expect life Mars with apparent seasonal color changes planet\'s surface. This phenomenon speculation that conditions might support bloom martian vegetation during warmer months cause plant life become dormant during colder periods. far, American missions Mars have been carried out. Four Mariner spacecraft three flying planet placed into martian orbit surveyed planet extensively before Viking Orbiters Landers arrived. Mariner launched late 1964, flew past Mars July 1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) surface. Transmitting Earth close-up pictures planet, spacecraft found many craters naturally occurring channels evidence artificial canals flowing water. Mariners followed with their flybys during summer 1969 returned pictures. Mariners showed diversity surface conditions well thin, cold, atmosphere carbon dioxide. 1971, Mariner Orbiter launched mission make year-long study martian surface. spacecraft arrived five half months after lift-off, only find Mars midst planet-wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible several weeks. after storm cleared, Mariner began returning first 7,329 pictures- these revealed previously unknown martian features, including evidence that large amounts water once flowed across surface, etching river valleys flood plains. August September 1975, Viking spacecraft each consisting orbiter lander lifted from Kennedy Space Center. mission designed answer several questions about planet, including, there life there? Nobody expected spacecraft spot martian cities, hoped that biology experiments Viking Landers would least find evidence primitive life past present. Viking Lander became first spacecraft successfully touch down another planet when landed July 1976, while United States celebrating Bicentennial. Photos sent back from Chryse Planitia (Plains Gold) showed bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned lander revealed rolling plain, littered with rocks marked rippled sand dunes. Fine dust from martian soil gives salmon hue. When Viking Lander touched down Utopia Planitia September 1976, viewed more rolling landscape than seen predecessor without visible dunes. results sent back laboratory each Viking Lander were inconclusive. Small samples martian soil were tested three different experiments designed detect biological processes. While some test results seemed indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this activity inorganic nature related planet\'s soil chemistry. there life Mars? knows sure, Viking mission found evidence that organic molecules exist there. Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind velocity direction well atmospheric temperature pressure. weather changes were observed. highest temperature recorded either craft degrees Celsius degrees Fahrenheit) Viking Lander site midsummer. lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees Fahrenheit), recorded more northerly Viking Lander site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured martian weather stations during global dust storms, because atmosphere thin, wind force minimal. Viking Lander photographed light patches frost probably water-ice during second winter planet. martian atmosphere, like that Venus, primarily carbon dioxide. Nitrogen oxygen present only small percentages. Martian contains only about 1/1,000 much water air, even this small amount condense out, forming clouds that ride high atmosphere swirl around slopes towering volcanoes. Local patches early morning form valleys. There evidence that past denser martian atmosphere have allowed water flow planet. Physical features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds islands suggest that great rivers once marked planet. Mars moons, Phobos Deimos. They small irregularly shaped possess ancient, cratered surfaces. possible moons were originally asteroids that ventured close Mars were captured gravity. Viking Orbiters Landers exceeded large margins their design lifetimes days, respectively. first fail Viking Orbiter which stopped operating July 1978, when leak depleted attitude-control gas. Viking Lander operated until April 1980, when shut down because battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter quit August 1980, when last attitude-control used Viking Lander ceased functioning November 1983. Despite inconclusive results Viking biology experiments, know more about Mars than other planet except Earth. NASA\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, launched September 1992, will expand knowledge martian environment lead human exploration planet. Asteroids solar system large number rocky metallic objects that orbit around small considered full-fledged planets. These objects known asteroids minor planets. Most, all, found band belt between orbits Mars Jupiter. Some have orbits that cross Earth\'s path, there evidence that Earth been asteroids past. least eroded, best preserved examples Barringer Meteor Crater near Winslow, Arizona. Asteroids material left over from formation solar system. theory suggests that they remains planet that destroyed massive collision long ago. More likely, asteroids material that never coalesced into planet. fact, estimated total mass asteroids gathered into single object, object would only about 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across less than half diameter Moon. Thousands asteroids have been identified from Earth. estimated that 100,000 bright enough eventually photographed through Earth-based telescopes. Much understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces space debris that fall surface Earth. Asteroids that collision course with Earth called meteoroids. When meteoroid strikes atmosphere high velocity, friction causes this chunk space matter incinerate streak light known meteor. meteoroid does burn completely, what\'s left strikes Earth\'s surface called meteorite. best places look meteorites Antarctica. meteorites examined, 92.8 percent composed silicate (stone), percent composed iron nickel- rest mixture three materials. Stony meteorites hardest identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks. Since asteroids material from very early solar system, scientists interested their composition. Spacecraft that have flown through asteroid belt have found that belt really quite empty that asteroids separated very large distances. Current future missions will selected asteroids closer examination. Galileo Orbiter, launched NASA October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids Jupiter. Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) Cassini missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled launch latter part 1990s, CRAF Cassini missions collaborative project NASA, European Space Agency federal space agencies Germany Italy, well United States Force Department Energy. day, space factories will mine asteroids materials. Jupiter Beyond Mars asteroid belt, outer regions solar system, giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus Neptune. 1972, NASA dispatched first four spacecraft slated conduct initial surveys these colossal worlds their moons rock. Jupiter first port call. Pioneer which lifted from Kennedy Space Center March 1972, first spacecraft penetrate asteroid belt travel outer regions solar system. December 1973, returned first close-up images Jupiter, flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) planet\'s banded cloud tops. Pioneer followed year later. Voyagers were launched summer 1977 returned spectacular photographs Jupiter family satellites during flybys 1979. These travelers found Jupiter whirling ball liquid hydrogen helium, topped with colorful atmosphere composed mostly gaseous hydrogen helium. Ammonia crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps phosphorus) produce brown orange hues that characterize Jupiter\'s atmosphere. likely that methane, ammonia, water other gases react form organic molecules regions between planet\'s frigid cloud tops warmer hydrogen ocean lying below. Because Jupiter\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these organic compounds they exist probably short-lived. Great Spot been observed centuries through telescopes Earth. This hurricane-like storm Jupiter\'s atmosphere more than twice size planet. high-pressure region, Great Spot spins direction opposite that low-pressure storms Jupiter- surrounded swirling currents that rotate around spot sometimes consumed Great Spot might million years old. spacecraft detected lightning Jupiter\'s upper atmosphere observed auroral emissions similar Earth\'s northern lights Jovian polar regions. Voyager returned first images faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter. Largest solar system\'s planets, Jupiter rotates dizzying pace once every hours minutes seconds. massive planet takes almost Earth years complete journey around Sun. With known moons, Jupiter something miniature solar system. mission Jupiter Galileo Project under way. After six- year cruise that takes Galileo Orbiter once past Venus, twice past Earth Moon once past asteroids, spacecraft will drop atmospheric probe into Jupiter\'s cloud layers relay data back Earth. Galileo Orbiter will spend years circling planet flying close Jupiter\'s large moons, exploring detail what Pioneers Voyagers revealed. Galilean Satellites 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed telescope Jupiter spotted four points light orbiting planet. first time, humans seen moons another world. honor their discoverer, these four bodies would become known Galilean satellites moons. Galileo might have happily traded this honor look dazzling photographs returned Voyager spacecraft they flew past these planet-sized satellites. most remarkable findings Voyager mission presence active volcanoes Galilean moon Volcanic eruptions never before been observed world other than Earth. Voyager cameras identified least nine active volcanoes with plumes ejected material extending kilometers (175 miles) above moon\'s surface. Io\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked orange yellow hues, probably result sulfur-rich materials brought surface volcanic activity. Volcanic activity this satellite result tidal flexing caused gravitational tug-of-war between Jupiter other three Galilean moons. Europa, approximately same size Moon, brightest Galilean satellite. moon\'s surface displays complex array streaks, indicating crust been fractured. Caught gravitational tug-of-war like Europa been heated enough cause interior melt apparently producing liquid-water ocean. This ocean covered crust that formed where water exposed cold space. Europa\'s core made rock that sank center. Like Europa, other Galilean moons Ganymede Callisto worlds rock. Ganymede largest satellite solar system larger than planets Mercury Pluto. satellite composed about percent water rest rock. Ganymede\'s surface areas different brightness, indicating that, past, material oozed moon\'s interior deposited various locations surface. Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, lowest density Galilean satellite, suggesting that large amounts water part composition. Callisto most heavily cratered object solar system- activity during history erased craters except more impacts. Detailed studies Galilean satellites will performed Galileo Orbiter. Saturn planet solar system adorned like Saturn. exquisite ring system unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn composed mostly hydrogen. contrast vivid colors wild turbulence found Jovian clouds, Saturn\'s atmosphere more subtle, butterscotch hue, markings muted high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\'s somewhat placid-looking appearance, scientists were surprised high-velocity equatorial stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) hour. Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer sped planet moon Titan September 1979, returning first close-up images. Voyager followed November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed first time complexities Saturn\'s ring system moons. Voyager flew planet moons August 1981. rings composed countless low-density particles orbiting individually around Saturn\'s equator progressive distances from cloud tops. Analysis spacecraft radio waves passing through rings showed that particles vary widely size, ranging from dust house-sized boulders. rings bright because they mostly frosted rock. rings might have resulted when moon passing body ventured close Saturn. unlucky object would have been torn apart great tidal forces surface interior. object have been fully formed begin with disintegrated under influence Saturn\'s gravity. third possibility that object shattered collisions with larger objects orbiting planet. Unable either form into moon drift away from each other, individual ring particles appear held place gravitational pull Saturn satellites. These complex gravitational interactions form thousands ringlets that make major rings. Radio emissions quite similar static heard radio during electrical storm were detected Voyager spacecraft. These emissions typical lightning believed coming from Saturn\'s ring system rather than atmosphere, where lightning observed. they Jupiter, Voyagers version Earth\'s auroras near Saturn\'s poles. Voyagers discovered moons found several satellites that share same orbit. learned that some moons shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\'s rings gaps rings. Saturn\'s 18th moon discovered 1990 from images taken Voyager 1981. Voyager determined that Titan nitrogen-based atmosphere with methane argon more like Earth\'s composition than carbon dioxide atmospheres Mars Venus. Titan\'s surface temperature -179 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might water-ice islands rising above oceans ethane-methane liquid sludge. Unfortunately, Voyager\'s cameras could penetrate moon\'s dense clouds. Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation converting Titan\'s methane ethane, acetylene combination with nitrogen hydrogen cyanide. latter compound building block amino acids. These conditions similar atmospheric conditions primeval Earth between three four billion years ago. However, Titan\'s atmospheric temperature believed permit progress beyond this stage organic chemistry. exploration Saturn will continue with Cassini mission. Cassini spacecraft will orbit planet will also deploy probe called Huygens, which will dropped into Titan\'s atmosphere fall surface. Cassini will probe well radar peer through Titan\'s clouds will spend years examining Saturnian system. Uranus January 1986, four half years after visiting Saturn, Voyager completed first close-up survey Uranian system. brief flyby revealed more information about Uranus retinue moons than been gleaned from ground observations since planet\'s discovery over centuries English astronomer William Herschel. Uranus, third largest planets, oddball solar system. Unlike other planets (with exception Pluto), this giant lies tipped side with north south poles alternately facing during 84-year swing around solar system. During Voyager 2\'s flyby, south pole faced Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when Earth-sized object collided with early life solar system. Voyager found that Uranus\' magnetic field does follow usual north-south axis found other planets. Instead, field tilted degrees offset from planet\'s center, phenomenon that Earth would like having magnetic pole York City other city Djakarta, island Java Indonesia. Uranus\' atmosphere consists mainly hydrogen, with some percent helium small amounts ammonia, methane water vapor. planet\'s blue color occurs because methane atmosphere absorbs other colors. Wind speeds range kilometers (360 miles) hour, temperatures near cloud tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit). Uranus\' sunlit south pole shrouded kind photochemical smog believed combination acetylene, ethane other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding planet\'s atmosphere extending thousands kilometers into space mysterious ultraviolet sheen known electroglow. Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\' cloud tops, there thought scalding ocean water dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep. Beneath this ocean Earth-sized core heavier materials. Voyager discovered moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105 miles) diameter, orbiting Uranus. five previously known Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania Oberon range size from 1,610 kilometers (323 1,000 miles) across. Representing geological showcase, these five moons half-ice, half-rock spheres that cold dark show evidence past activity, including faulting flows. most remarkable Uranus\' moons Miranda. surface features high cliffs well canyons, crater-pocked plains winding valleys. sharp variations terrain suggest that, after moon formed, smashed apart collision with another body event unusual solar system, which contains many objects that have impact craters fragments from large impacts. What extraordinary that Miranda apparently reformed with some material that been interior exposed surface. Uranus thought have nine dark rings- Voyager imaged contrast Saturn\'s rings, which composed bright particles, Uranus\' rings primarily made dark, boulder-sized chunks. Neptune Voyager completed 12-year tour solar system with investigation Neptune planet\'s moons. August 1989, spacecraft swept within 4,850 kilometers (3,010 miles) Neptune then flew moon Triton. During Neptune encounter became clear that planet\'s atmosphere more active than Uranus\'. Voyager observed Great Dark Spot, circular storm size Earth, Neptune\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\'s Great Spot, storm spins counterclockwise moves westward almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) hour. Voyager also noted smaller dark spot fast-moving cloud dubbed Scooter, well high-altitude clouds over main hydrogen helium cloud deck. highest wind speeds planet were observed, 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) hour. Like other giant planets, Neptune gaseous hydrogen helium upper layer over liquid interior. planet\'s core contains higher percentage rock metal than those other giants. Neptune\'s distinctive blue appearance, like Uranus\' blue color, atmospheric methane. Neptune\'s magnetic field tilted relative planet\'s spin axis centered core. This phenomenon similar Uranus\' magnetic field suggests that fields giants being generated area above cores, where pressure great that liquid hydrogen assumes electrical properties metal. Earth\'s magnetic field, other hand, produced spinning metallic core only slightly tilted offset relative center. Voyager also shed light mystery Neptune\'s rings. Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs material orbit around giant planet. clear Neptune could have arcs these could kept from spreading into even, unclumped rings. Voyager detected these arcs, they were, fact, part thin, complete rings. number small moons could explain arcs, such bodies were spotted. Astronomers identified Neptunian moons Triton 1846 Nereid 1949. Voyager found more. moons Proteus actually larger than Nereid, since Proteus orbits close Neptune, lost planet\'s glare observers Earth. Triton circles Neptune retrograde orbit under days. Tidal forces Triton causing spiral slowly towards planet. million years short time astronomical terms), moon will close that Neptunian gravity will tear apart, forming spectacular ring accompany planet\'s modest current rings. Triton\'s landscape strange unexpected those Miranda. moon more rock than counterparts Saturn Uranus. Triton\'s mantle probably composed water-ice, moon\'s crust thin veneer nitrogen methane. moon shows dramatically different types terrain: so-called cantaloupe terrain receding cap. Dark streaks appear cap. These streaks fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen dark, fine-grained particles heights kilometers miles). Triton\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th thick Earth\'s, winds that carry dark particles deposit them streaks coldest surface found solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees Fahrenheit). Triton might more like Pluto than other object spacecraft have visited. Pluto Pluto most distant planets, eccentricity orbit periodically carries inside Neptune\'s orbit, where been since 1979 where will remain until March 1999. Pluto\'s orbit also highly inclined tilted degrees orbital plane other planets. Discovered 1930, Pluto appears little more than celestial snowball. planet\'s diameter calculated approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds size Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\'s surface covered with methane that there thin atmosphere that freeze fall surface planet moves away from Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\'s spin axis tipped degrees. planet known satellite, Charon, discovered 1978. Charon\'s surface composition different from Pluto\'s: moon appears covered with water-ice rather than methane ice. orbit gravitationally locked with Pluto, both bodies always keep same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\'s Charon\'s rotational period Charon\'s period revolution Earth days. Although spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA currently exploring possibility such mission. Comets outermost members solar system occasionally visit inner planets. asteroids rocky metallic remnants formation solar system, comets debris from that beginning survive only from Sun. Most comet nuclei reside Oort Cloud, loose swarm objects halo beyond planets reaching perhaps halfway nearest star. Comet nuclei orbit this frozen abyss until they gravitationally perturbed into orbits that carry them close Sun. nucleus falls inside orbits outer planets, volatile elements which made gradually warm- time nucleus enters region inner planets, these volatile elements boiling. nucleus itself irregular only miles across, made principally water-ice with methane ammonia materials very similar those composing moons giant planets. these materials boil nucleus, they form coma cloud-like head that measure tens thousands kilometers across. coma grows comet gets closer Sun. stream charged particles coming from pushes this cloud, blowing back like flag wind giving rise comet\'s tails. Gases ions blown directly back from nucleus, dust particles pushed more slowly. nucleus continues orbit, dust particles left behind curved arc. Both dust tails point away from Sun- effect, comet chases tails recedes from Sun. tails reach million kilometers million miles) length, total amount material contained this dramatic display would ordinary suitcase. Comets from Latin cometa, meaning long-haired essentially dramatic light shows. Some comets pass through solar system only once, others have their orbits gravitationally modified close encounter with giant outer planets. These latter visitors enter closed elliptical orbits repeatedly return inner solar system. Halley\'s Comet most famous example relatively short period comet, returning average once every years orbiting from beyond Neptune within Venus\' orbit. Confirmed sightings comet back B.C. This regular visitor solar system named Edmond Halley, because plotted comet\'s orbit predicted return, based earlier sightings Newtonian laws motion. name became part astronomical lore when, 1759, comet returned schedule. Unfortunately, Edmond live comet very prominent passes comparatively close Earth. Unfortunately, most recent appearance, Halley\'s Comet passed closer than 62.4 million kilometers (38.8 million miles) from world. comet visible naked eye, especially viewers southern hemisphere, spectacular. Comets have been bright, rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime. Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted omens have been artistically rendered daggers sky. Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will become first traveler close comet nucleus remain proximity they both approach Sun. CRAF will observe nucleus becomes active growing sunlight begins have lighter elements boil form coma tails. Several spacecraft have flown comets high speed- first NASA\'s International Cometary Explorer 1985. armada five spacecraft (two Japanese, Soviet Giotto spacecraft from European Space Agency) flew Halley\'s Comet 1986. Conclusion Despite their efforts peer across vast distances space through obscuring atmosphere, scientists past only body they could study closely Earth. since 1959, spaceflight through solar system lifted veil neighbors space. have learned more about solar system members than anyone previous thousands years. automated spacecraft have traveled Moon planets beyond world except Pluto- they have observed moons large small planets, flown comets sampled solar environment.

When work large program like Freedom Shuttle performed NASA center, center skims portion which goes into what amounts slush fund. This money used fund work center manager wants fund. This estimated over third funds allocated. Think about that: billion cost Freedom, fully billion won\'t spent anything having anything with Space Stations! Now, maybe that billion wisely spent (and maybe wasn\'t), work done with should stand merits, distorting cost other projects. Congress idea existense these wraps- Congress never heard term \'center tax\'. They look Station they getting price they paying note that doesn\'t They wonder this blissfully unaware that third money going something else. dear friends, your mixing fact fiction here. couple weeks ago, when first read this your posting, talked with cost experts here Space Station Headquarters wondering didn\'t post response immediately, have real I\'m supposed doing here Headquarters, digging data looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty totem pole priority. Also, spent last weekend Kansas City, National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling virtues 15,000 science teachers.] First off, yes, concept \'center tax\', \'wrap\' does exist. recall numbers correctly, total \'tax\' program this fiscal year around Million. This computed adding WP-1, WP-2, WP-4 center \'taxes\'. With budget this fiscal year $2.2 Billion, calculater says percentage 04/2.2 1.8\% Over life program, using your figure billion cost SSF, 1.8\% rate comes $540 million. This alot less than billion, will concede it\'s still appreciable amount pocket change. should note that your estimate rate could close actual rate. only charged funds that spent center (kind like McDonalds some states, where have sales food restaurant, don\'t take-out). example, WP-4, vast bulk funds receive Rocketdyne Contract, *NOT* subject center don\'t have numbers front I\'d guess least 95\% WP-4 funds Rocketdyne). could right about rate 1/3, it\'s only applied funds spent center, prime contracts. This leads obvious question What government doing with funds that don\'t prime contractors? (i.e. WP-4 gets slice billion pie. portion this slice goes Rocketdyne. What happens balance funds, which aren\'t eaten center tax?) WP-4, call these funds spend in-house supporting development funds they supporting development work done Rocketdyne). have used these funds setup testbed, checkout electrical power system architecture. testbed real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research years back), with lead-acid batteries simulate Nickel-Hydrogen batteries SSF), switchgear, DC-DC converter units, simulated loads.

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group, original name committee that wrote standard. JPEG designed compressing either full-color gray-scale digital images natural, real-world scenes. does work well non-realistic images, such cartoons line drawings. JPEG does handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, does handle motion picture compression. Standards compressing those types images being worked other committees, named JBIG MPEG respectively. JPEG lossy, meaning that image decompression isn\'t quite identical what originally algorithm achieves much compression exploiting known limitations human eye, notably fact that small color details aren\'t perceived well small details light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG intended compressing images that will looked humans. plan machine-analyze your images, small errors introduced JPEG problem you, even they invisible eye. useful property JPEG that degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters. This means that image maker trade file size against output image quality. make *extremely* small files don\'t mind poor quality- this useful indexing image archives, making thumbnail views icons, etc. etc. Conversely, aren\'t happy with output quality default compression setting, jack quality until satisfied, accept lesser compression. JPEG? There good reasons: make your image files smaller, store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller transmitting files across networks archiving libraries images. Being able compress Mbyte full-color file down Kbytes makes difference disk space transmission time! comparing JPEG, size ratio more like four one. More details below.) your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly, you\'ll have convert JPEG some other format viewing manipulating images. Even with JPEG-capable viewer, takes longer decode view JPEG image than view image simpler format (GIF, instance). Thus, using JPEG essentially time/space tradeoff: give some time order store transmit image more cheaply. It\'s worth noting that when network phone transmission involved, time savings from transferring shorter file much greater than extra time decompress file. I\'ll arithmetic yourself. other reason JPEG will gradually replace standard Usenet posting format that JPEG store full color information: bits/pixel million colors) instead less (256 fewer colors). have only 8-bit display hardware then this seem like much advantage you. Within couple years, though, 8-bit will look obsolete black-and-white MacPaint format does today. Furthermore, reasons detailed section JPEG more useful than exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG considerably more appropriate than Usenet posting standard. When should JPEG, when should stick with GIF? JPEG *not* going displace entirely- some types images, superior image quality, file size, both. first things learn about JPEG which kinds images apply rule thumb, JPEG superior storing full-color gray-scale images realistic scenes- that means scanned photographs similar material. JPEG superior even don\'t have 24-bit display hardware, superior (See section details.) does significantly better images with only distinct colors, such cartoons line drawings. particular, large areas pixels that *exactly* same color compressed very efficiently indeed GIF. JPEG can\'t squeeze these files much does without introducing visible defects. This sort image best kept form. particular, single-color borders quite cheap files, they should avoided JPEG files.) JPEG also hard time with very sharp edges: pure-black pixels adjacent pure-white pixels, example. Sharp edges tend come blurred unless very high quality setting. Again, this sort thing found scanned photographs, shows fairly often files: borders, overlaid text, etc. blurriness particularly objectionable with text that\'s only pixels high. have with small-size overlaid text, don\'t JPEG Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, instance) usually fall between scanned images cartoons terms complexity. more complex subtly rendered image, more likely that JPEG will well same goes semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never converted JPEG. need least about gray levels before JPEG useful gray-scale images. should also noted that lossless gray-scale images levels, while JPEG not. have existing library images, wonder whether should convert them JPEG. will lose little image quality (Section which argues that JPEG image quality superior GIF, only applies both formats start from full-color original. start from GIF, you\'ve already irretrievably lost great deal information- JPEG only make things worse.) However, disk space savings justify converting anyway. This decision you\'ll have make yourself. convert library JPEG, section hints. prepared leave some images format, since some GIFs will convert well. well does JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well.

This seems typical ratio real-world scenes. What good quality settings JPEG? Most JPEG compressors pick file size image quality tradeoff selecting quality setting. There seems widespread confusion about meaning these settings. Quality does mean keep 95\% information, some have claimed. quality scale purely arbitrary- it\'s percentage anything. name game using JPEG pick lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into image indistinguishable from original. This setting will vary from image another from observer another, here some rules thumb. default quality setting very often best choice. This setting about lowest without expecting defects typical image. first- defects, then Except experimental purposes, never above saying will produce file three times large hardly better quality. image less than perfect quality begin with, might able down without objectionable degradation. other hand, might need HIGHER quality setting avoid further degradation. second case seems apply much time when converting GIFs JPEG. default about right compressing 24-bit images, usually better converting GIFs (see section more info). want very small file (say preview indexing purposes) prepared tolerate large defects, setting range about right. amusing art. (Note: quality settings discussed this article apply free JPEG software described section many programs based Other JPEG implementations, such Image Alchemy, completely different quality scale. Some programs don\'t even provide numeric scale, just high/medium/low-style choices.) Where JPEG software? Most programs described this section available FTP. don\'t know FTP, article find sources. don\'t have direct access FTP, read about ftpmail servers same article.) That article appears regularly news.answers, sending e-mail mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources body. Anonymous List also helpful it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq news.answers archive. NOTE: this list changes constantly. have copy more than couple months old, latest JPEG from news.answers archive. [6A] looking canned software, viewers, etc: first part this list system-specific programs that only kind system. don\'t what want your machine, check portable JPEG software described list. Note that this list concentrates free shareware programs that obtain over Internet- some commercial programs listed too. Windows: John Bradley\'s free (version 2.00 excellent viewer JPEG, GIF, other image formats. It\'s available from export.lcs.mit.edu ftp.cis.upenn.edu. file called \'xv-???.tar.Z\' (where version number, currently 2.21)- located \'contrib\' directory export \'pub/xv\' directory upenn. reduces images bits internally, which means it\'s real good choice have 24-bit display (you\'ll still only 8-bit color). Also, shouldn\'t convert full-color images JPEG, because they\'ll color-quantized first. fine tool converting other 8-bit images JPEG. CAUTION: there glitch versions 2.21 earlier: sure check save normal size checkbox when saving JPEG file, file will blurry. Another good choice Windows John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing conversion tasks. ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly- colormapped displays, does better (though slower) color quantization than basic free JPEG software. Both above large, complex packages. just want simple image viewer, xloadimage xli. xloadimage supports JPEG latest release, 3.03. xloadimage free available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z. variant version xloadimage, said fans somewhat faster more robust than original. (The current indeed faster more robust than current xloadimage, least with respect JPEG files, because decoder while xloadimage 3.03 using hacked-over next xloadimage release will this.) also free available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs said right thing with 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS- Windows OS/2 programs, next headings. good choice Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG files. current version, 2.4a, available from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip. This good basic viewer that works either 386/486 machines. user interface flashy, it\'s functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview. current version, 1.2, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires better VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 386MAX work- Windows OS/2 not). Hiview currently fastest viewer images that bigger than your screen. larger images, scales image down screen (rather than using panning/scrolling most viewers do). prefer this approach, there\'s denying that slows down loading large images considerably. Note: installation tricky- read directions carefully! shareware alternative ColorView ($30). This easier install than either freeware alternatives. user interface also much spiffier-looking, although personally find harder more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. faster than DVPEG little slower than Hiview, least hardware. (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG ColorView seem about same speed, both faster than Hiview.) current version 2.1, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires VESA graphics driver- don\'t have one, look vesadrv2.zip vesa-tsr.zip from same directory. (Many recent have built-in VESA driver, don\'t load VESA driver unless ColorView complains that driver missing.) second shareware alternative Fullview, which been kicking around while, don\'t know stable archive location current (rather old) version inferior above viewers anyway. author tells that version Fullview will shortly will submitted Simtel20 archives that time. well-known viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half speed above viewers) image quality poor except hi-color displays. it\'d have been nice good JPEG capability CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. remarkable variety graphics hardware, these viewers might work your particular machine. can\'t *any* them work, you\'ll need following conversion programs convert JPEG GIF, then view with your favorite viewer. have hi-color hardware, don\'t intermediate format- find TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 reputed right thing with hi-color displays.) Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters FTPable from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip jpeg4386.zip have extended memory). These files compilations free source code described section they will convert JPEG from GIF, Targa, formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These slow limited conversion from format- particular, can\'t 24-bit color output from JPEG. major advantage these tools that they will read write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format well Usenet-standard JFIF format.

NOTE: format files posted Internet, since readable non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also shareware image conversion manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF formats) from many other image formats. also display images. demo version Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: Internet\'s archive site PC-related programs Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs non-Unix system with weird directory names- where this document refers directory (eg) msdos/graphics Simtel20, that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>. physically MILnet, should expect rather slow transfer rates from Simtel20. There several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) Simtel20 archives- most users should mirror sites instead. popular mirror site oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics. have capability, retrieve files from Simtel20 e-mail- informational postings comp.archives.msdos.announce find how. outside USA, consult same newsgroup learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror Microsoft Windows: There several Windows programs capable displaying JPEG images.

Requires Windows 256-or-more-colors mode. This no-frills viewer with habit hogging machine completely while decodes- image quality noticeably worse than other viewers. it\'s fast you\'ll anyway, least previewing... JView freeware, fairly fast, good on-line help, write decompressed image Windows format- can\'t create JPEG files, doesn\'t view GIFs. JView also lacks some other useful features shareware viewers (such brightness adjustment), it\'s excellent basic viewer. current version, 0.9, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors this archive found some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, image files- write these formats too, used converter. some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment slideshow. current version 2.1, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This slow 286-compatible version- register, you\'ll 386-only version, which roughly 25\% faster.) ColorView another shareware entry ($30). This early promising contender, been updated some time, this point real advantages over WinJPEG. want anyway, current version 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip. understand that version will appearing once authors finished with ColorView DOS.)

QuickTime, need 68020 better need running System 6.0.7 later. you\'re running System must also install 32-bit QuickDraw extension- this built-in System QuickTime from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which better than several ways. With respect JPEG, marginally faster considerably less prone crash when corrupt JPEG file. However, some applications seem have compatibility problems with 1.5.) users should keep mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, same Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section details.) post images Usenet, make sure they JFIF format. Most programs mentioned below generate either format. first choice probably JPEGView, free program viewing images that JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, format. also convert between JPEG formats. current version, 2.0, improvement over prior versions. from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System QuickTime. 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces best color image quality currently available JPEG viewers. JPEGView view large images much less memory than other viewers- fact, it\'s only that deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels typical Mac. Given large image, JPEGView automatically scales down screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (You zoom desired portion, though.) Some people like this behavior, some don\'t. Overall, JPEGView\'s user interface very well thought out. GIFConverter, shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF PICT/JPEG, well several other image formats. latest version 2.3.2. from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 later. GIFConverter better than JPEGView plain JPEG/GIF viewer, much more extensive image manipulation format conversion capabilities, find worth shareware playing around with images. Also, newest version GIFConverter load save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, your best your machine QuickTime. (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: GIFConverter runs memory trying load large JPEG, converting file with JPEG Convert, then viewing version.

Requires QuickTime. PictPixie intended developer\'s tool, it\'s really best choice unless like fool around with QuickTime. Some drawbacks that requires lots memory, produces relatively poor color image quality anything less than 24-bit display, relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie unsupported program, meaning some minor bugs that Apple does intend fix. (There version PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around net. have this should trash it\'s even buggier. Also, QuickTime Starter includes much cleaned-up descendant PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note that Picture Compressor free distributed net.)

Most people don\'t have full-color pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores fewer bits pixel, display fewer distinct colors time. display full-color image, computer must image into appropriate representative colors. This process called color quantization. (This something misnomer, color selection would better term. We\'re stuck with standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization lossy process. turns that most images, details color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact final image quality than errors introduced JPEG (except very lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG full-color format, converting color JPEG image display 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This true *all* color JPEGs: even feed 256-or-less-color into JPEG, what comes decompressor *not* colors, thousands colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel little differently, pixels that started with identical colors will probably come with slightly different colors. Each original color gets smeared into group nearby colors. Therefore quantization always required display color JPEG colormapped display, regardless image source. only avoid quantization gray-scale output. (Incidentally, because this effect it\'s nearly meaningless talk about number colors used JPEG image. Even attempted count number distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give different results because roundoff error differences. occasionally posted images described 256-color JPEG. This tells that poster hasn\'t read this probably converted JPEG from GIF. JPEGs classified color gray-scale (just like photographs), number colors just isn\'t useful concept JPEG.) other hand, image definition already been quantized fewer colors. *does* have definite number colors palette, format doesn\'t allow more than palette entries.) purposes Usenet picture distribution, advantage that sender precomputes color quantization, recipients don\'t have This also *disadvantage* GIF: you\'re stuck with sender\'s quantization. sender quantized different number colors than what display, have re-quantize, resulting much poorer image quality than quantized once from full-color image. Furthermore, sender didn\'t high-quality color quantization algorithm, you\'re luck. this reason, JPEG offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines don\'t match sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image quantized precisely match user\'s display hardware. Furthermore, will able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms (there active research this area), purchase better display hardware, better view JPEG images already have. With GIF, you\'re stuck forevermore with what sent. It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. view 256-color 16-color display, example, probably getting much worse image than need This partly inevitable consequence doing color quantizations (one create GIF, display it), often it\'s also sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs will forced high quality quantizers order acceptable results all, normal they will quantize directly number colors displayed. Thus, JPEG likely provide better results than average program low-color-resolution displays well high-resolution ones! Finally, ever-growing number people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color displays, true 24-bit displays workstations Macintoshes, etc. these people, already obsolete, cannot represent image full capabilities their display. JPEG images drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG all-around better choice than representing images machine-independent fashion. does JPEG work? buzz-words know chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, Huffman arithmetic entropy coding. This article\'s long enough already, I\'m going more than that here. technical information, comp.compression FAQ. This available from news.answers archive rtfm.mit.edu, files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. need help using news.answers archive, this article. What about lossless JPEG? There\'s great deal confusion this subject. JPEG committee define truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., that guarantees final output bit-for-bit identical original input. However, this lossless mode almost nothing common with regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, offers much less compression. present, very implementations lossless JPEG exist, them commercial. Saying free JPEG software DOES lossless image. What does deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step. There still good deal information loss color subsampling step. (With free JPEG code, also -sample turn subsampling. Keep mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with resulting file.) Even with both quantization subsampling turned off, regular JPEG algorithm lossless, because subject roundoff errors various calculations. maximum error counts pixel value- it\'s highly unlikely that this could perceived human eye, might concern doing machine processing image. this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that perhaps half size uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly same amount compression, guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. have application requiring lossless storage images with less than bits pixel (per color component), want look into JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better than JPEG lossless such images. JPEG lossless superior JBIG images with more bits pixel- furthermore, JPEG public domain least with Huffman back end), while JBIG techniques heavily covered patents. [10] argument about file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only family compression algorithms- does *not* refer specific image file format. JPEG committee prevented from defining file format turf wars within international standards organizations. Since can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless agree common file format, this leaves with problem. absence official standards, number JPEG program writers have just gone their thing, result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s. closest thing have de-facto standard JPEG format some work that\'s been coordinated people C-Cube Microsystems. They have defined JPEG-based file formats: JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), low-end format that transports pixels much else. TIFF/JPEG, TIFF 6.0, extension Aldus TIFF format. TIFF high-end format that will record just about everything ever wanted know about image, more besides :-). TIFF more complex than JFIF, well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different incompatible subsets TIFF. It\'s likely that adding JPEG will anything improve this situation. Both these formats were developed with input from major vendors JPEG-related products- it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere both standards. believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF replacement picture postings. JFIF simpler than TIFF available now- TIFF spec only recently been officially adopted, still unusably vague some crucial details. Even when TIFF/JPEG well defined, JFIF format likely widely supported lowest common denominator- TIFF/JPEG files never transportable. particular case that people interested Apple\'s QuickTime software Macintosh. QuickTime uses JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion between JFIF QuickTime JPEG pretty straightforward, several programs available (see portion section 6A). have editor that handles binary files, strip QuickTime JPEG PICT down JFIF hand- section details. Another particular case Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF Image Alchemy). These programs capable reading writing JFIF format. default, though, they write proprietary format developed HSI. This format readable non-HSI programs should used Usenet postings. switch JFIF output. (This applies versions these programs- current releases emit JFIF format default. still should careful post HSI-format files, unless want flamed people non-PC platforms.) [11] recognize which file format have, what about have alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read, it\'s likely format some other proprietary JPEG-based format. tell what have inspecting first bytes file: JFIF-standard file will start with characters (hex) followed variable bytes (often 10), followed \'JFIF\'. start, rest have JPEG file. This probably decodable as-is JFIF software it\'s worth try, anyway. files start with \'hsi1\'. You\'re luck unless have software. Portions file look like plain JPEG data, they won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs. Macintosh PICT file, JPEG-compressed, will have couple hundred bytes header followed JFIF header (scan \'JFIF\'). Strip everything before should able read Anything else: it\'s proprietary format, JPEG all. lucky, file consist header JPEG data stream. identify start JPEG data stream (look D8), stripping everything before that. uuencoded Usenet postings, characteristic JFIF pattern \tbegin line \tM_]C_X whereas uuencoded files will start with \tbegin line \tM:\'-I learn check former, save yourself trouble downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What about arithmetic coding? JPEG spec defines different back modules final output compressed data: either Huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed. choice impact image quality, arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file. typical images, arithmetic coding produces file percent smaller than Huffman coding. (All file-size numbers previously cited Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, particular variant arithmetic coding specified JPEG standard subject patents owned IBM, AT&T, Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally arithmetic coding* unless obtain licenses from these companies. (The fair doctrine allows people implement test algorithm, actually storing images with dubious best.) least short run, recommend that people worry about arithmetic coding- space savings isn\'t great enough justify potential legal hassles. particular, arithmetic coding *should not* used images exchanged Usenet. There some small chance that legal situation change future. Stay tuned further details. [13] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? would nice having compressed image with JPEG, could decompress manipulate (crop border, say), recompress without further image degradation beyond what lost initially. Unfortunately THIS CASE. general, recompressing altered image loses more information, though usually much lost first time around. next best thing would that decompress image recompress *without changing then there further loss, i.e., identical JPEG file. Even this true- least, with current free JPEG software. It\'s essentially problem accumulation roundoff error. repeatedly compress decompress, image will eventually degrade where visible changes from first-generation output. usually takes many such cycles visible change.) things to-do list accumulation error avoided limited, optimistic about case, most that could possibly guaranteed would that compressing unmodified full-color output djpeg, original quality setting, would introduce further loss. Even such simple changes cropping border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. you\'re wondering why, it\'s because pixel-block boundaries move. cropped only multiples pixels, might safe, that\'s mighty limited capability!) bottom line that JPEG useful format archival storage transmission images, don\'t want intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps. lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working image, then JPEG when ready file away. Aside from avoiding degradation, will save compression/decompression time this :-). [14] What some rules thumb converting images JPEG? stated earlier, *will* lose some amount image information convert existing image JPEG. obtain original full-color data made from, it\'s better make JPEG from that. need save space have only work from, here some suggestions getting maximum space savings with minimum loss quality. first rule when converting library look each JPEG, make sure happy with before throwing away corresponding GIF- that will give chance re-do conversion with higher quality setting necessary. Some GIFs better left GIFs, explained section particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen fewer colors don\'t convert well. find that JPEG file reasonable quality will *larger* than GIF. check sizes too.) Experience date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs best candidates conversion JPEG. They chew most storage offer most potential savings, they convert JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting much under Kbytes. Also, don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs small those created directly from full-color originals. maintain image quality have converted files much twice straight-through JPEG files would (i.e., shoot 1/3rd size file, 1/4th suggested earlier comparisons). Many people have developed habit putting large constant-color border around image. While useless, this nearly free terms storage cost files. free JPEG files, sharp border boundary create visible artifacts (ghost edges). yourself favor crop border before JPEGing. Windows system, XV\'s manual automatic cropping functions very painless this.) cjpeg\'s default setting appropriate full-color input, inputs, settings often seem necessary avoid image degradation. apply smoothing suggested below, higher setting necessary.) Color GIFs photographs complex artwork usually dithered fool your into seeing more than colors that actually store. enlarge image, will that adjacent pixels often significantly different colors- normal size averages these pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value. trouble with dithering that, JPEG, looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise- JPEG can\'t compress noise very well. resulting JPEG file both larger lower image quality than what would have gotten from JPEGing original full color image it). around this, want smooth image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating color that thought anyway, process getting rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble. Appropriate smoothing will often avoid using high factor, thus further reducing size compressed file, while still obtaining better-looking output image than you\'d without smoothing. With free JPEG software products based it), simple smoothing capability built -smooth when converting GIFs. Values seem work well high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering require larger smoothing factors. regular fine-scale patterns image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing definitely called for.) large smoothing factor will blur output image, which don\'t want. image processing wizard, also smoothing with separate filtering program, such pnmconvol from PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg\'s built-in smoother faster than pnmconvol... upshot this that cjpeg -quality -smooth probably good starting point converting GIFs. really care about image, you\'ll want check results maybe other settings. --------------------- more information about JPEG general free JPEG software particular, contact Independent JPEG Group jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.;1

Israelites were direct witness God\'s existence. disobey after KNOWing that real would outright denial therefore immediately punishable. Remember, these laws were written different time applied only God\'s chosen people. Jesus changed that. living grace. longer immediately punishable death. There repentance there salvation through Lord Jesus Christ. just chosen people. Salvation available everyone, Gentile alike. These conflicting statements. clarification other breach logic. don\'t mind people shifting their position issue. irritates when said under premise that change made. What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25? wrong now? Jesus change that? anything, clarified such that quote made. following verses, Jesus takes several portions expounds upon giving clearer meaning what intended. Sure does this. However, doesn\'t address notion stoning non-virgin brides, because this needs clarification. going deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 patently clear intent? think will agree with that there today\'s world, modern-day Pharisees know bible from believe What good head knowledge there nothing heart?

JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands Joint Photographic Experts Group, original name committee that wrote standard. JPEG designed compressing either full-color gray-scale digital images natural, real-world scenes. does work well non-realistic images, such cartoons line drawings. JPEG does handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, does handle motion picture compression. Standards compressing those types images being worked other committees, named JBIG MPEG respectively. JPEG lossy, meaning that image decompression isn\'t quite identical what originally algorithm achieves much compression exploiting known limitations human eye, notably fact that small color details aren\'t perceived well small details light-and-dark. Thus, JPEG intended compressing images that will looked humans. plan machine-analyze your images, small errors introduced JPEG problem you, even they invisible eye. useful property JPEG that degree lossiness varied adjusting compression parameters. This means that image maker trade file size against output image quality. make *extremely* small files don\'t mind poor quality- this useful indexing image archives, making thumbnail views icons, etc. etc. Conversely, aren\'t happy with output quality default compression setting, jack quality until satisfied, accept lesser compression. JPEG? There good reasons: make your image files smaller, store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead 8-bit-per-pixel data. Making image files smaller transmitting files across networks archiving libraries images. Being able compress Mbyte full-color file down Kbytes makes difference disk space transmission time! comparing JPEG, size ratio more like four one. More details below.) your viewing software doesn\'t support JPEG directly, you\'ll have convert JPEG some other format viewing manipulating images. Even with JPEG-capable viewer, takes longer decode view JPEG image than view image simpler format (GIF, instance). Thus, using JPEG essentially time/space tradeoff: give some time order store transmit image more cheaply. It\'s worth noting that when network phone transmission involved, time savings from transferring shorter file much greater than extra time decompress file. I\'ll arithmetic yourself. other reason JPEG will gradually replace standard Usenet posting format that JPEG store full color information: bits/pixel million colors) instead less (256 fewer colors). have only 8-bit display hardware then this seem like much advantage you. Within couple years, though, 8-bit will look obsolete black-and-white MacPaint format does today. Furthermore, reasons detailed section JPEG more useful than exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware. Hence JPEG considerably more appropriate than Usenet posting standard. When should JPEG, when should stick with GIF? JPEG *not* going displace entirely- some types images, superior image quality, file size, both. first things learn about JPEG which kinds images apply rule thumb, JPEG superior storing full-color gray-scale images realistic scenes- that means scanned photographs similar material. JPEG superior even don\'t have 24-bit display hardware, superior (See section details.) does significantly better images with only distinct colors, such cartoons line drawings. particular, large areas pixels that *exactly* same color compressed very efficiently indeed GIF. JPEG can\'t squeeze these files much does without introducing visible defects. This sort image best kept form. particular, single-color borders quite cheap files, they should avoided JPEG files.) JPEG also hard time with very sharp edges: pure-black pixels adjacent pure-white pixels, example. Sharp edges tend come blurred unless very high quality setting. Again, this sort thing found scanned photographs, shows fairly often files: borders, overlaid text, etc. blurriness particularly objectionable with text that\'s only pixels high. have with small-size overlaid text, don\'t JPEG Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, instance) usually fall between scanned images cartoons terms complexity. more complex subtly rendered image, more likely that JPEG will well same goes semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings such). Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never converted JPEG. need least about gray levels before JPEG useful gray-scale images. should also noted that lossless gray-scale images levels, while JPEG not. have existing library images, wonder whether should convert them JPEG. will lose little image quality (Section which argues that JPEG image quality superior GIF, only applies both formats start from full-color original. start from GIF, you\'ve already irretrievably lost great deal information- JPEG only make things worse.) However, disk space savings justify converting anyway. This decision you\'ll have make yourself. convert library JPEG, section hints. prepared leave some images format, since some GIFs will convert well. well does JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here some sample file sizes image have handy, 727x525 full-color image ship harbor. first three files comparison purposes- rest were created with free JPEG software described section File\t Size bytes\t\tComments ship.ppm\t1145040 Original file format compression- bits \t\t\t bytes pixel, plus bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z\t 963829 file passed through Unix compress \t\t\t compress doesn\'t accomplish lot, you\'ll note. \t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif\t 240438 Converted with ppmquant ppmtogif \t\t\t Most savings result losing color \t\t\t info: saves bits/pixel, (See sec. ship.jpg95\t 155622 cjpeg (highest useful quality setting) \t\t\t This indistinguishable from 24-bit original, \t\t\t least nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75\t 58009 cjpeg (default setting) \t\t\t have look mighty darn close distinguish this \t\t\t from original, even with both on-screen once. ship.jpg50\t 38406 cjpeg \t\t\t This slight defects- know what look \t\t\t for, could tell it\'s been JPEGed without seeing \t\t\t original.

Note that this file TINY: \t\t\t compression ratio from original 173:1 this case JPEG make file that\'s factor four five smaller than comparable quality (the file every good GIF, better have full-color display). This seems typical ratio real-world scenes. What good quality settings JPEG? Most JPEG compressors pick file size image quality tradeoff selecting quality setting. There seems widespread confusion about meaning these settings. Quality does mean keep 95\% information, some have claimed. quality scale purely arbitrary- it\'s percentage anything. name game using JPEG pick lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into image indistinguishable from original. This setting will vary from image another from observer another, here some rules thumb. default quality setting very often best choice. This setting about lowest without expecting defects typical image. first- defects, then Except experimental purposes, never above saying will produce file three times large hardly better quality. image less than perfect quality begin with, might able down without objectionable degradation. other hand, might need HIGHER quality setting avoid further degradation. second case seems apply much time when converting GIFs JPEG. default about right compressing 24-bit images, usually better converting GIFs (see section more info). want very small file (say preview indexing purposes) prepared tolerate large defects, setting range about right. amusing art. (Note: quality settings discussed this article apply free JPEG software described section many programs based Other JPEG implementations, such Image Alchemy, completely different quality scale. Some programs don\'t even provide numeric scale, just high/medium/low-style choices.) Where JPEG software? Most programs described this section available FTP. don\'t know FTP, article find sources. don\'t have direct access FTP, read about ftpmail servers same article.) That article appears regularly news.answers, sending e-mail mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources body. Anonymous List also helpful it\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq news.answers archive. NOTE: this list changes constantly. have copy more than couple months old, latest JPEG from news.answers archive. [6A] looking canned software, viewers, etc: first part this list system-specific programs that only kind system. don\'t what want your machine, check portable JPEG software described list. Note that this list concentrates free shareware programs that obtain over Internet- some commercial programs listed too. Windows: (shareware, $25) excellent viewer JPEG, GIF, many other image formats. also format conversion some simple image manipulations. It\'s available from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z. Version 3.00 major upgrade with support 24-bit displays many other improvements- however, brand still some bugs lurking. prefer bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export. Note that version 2.21 good choice have 24-bit display (you\'ll only 8-bit color), converting 24-bit images JPEG. 2.21 works fine converting other 8-bit images JPEG. CAUTION: there glitch version 2.21: sure check save normal size checkbox when saving JPEG file, file will blurry. Another good choice Windows John Cristy\'s free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing conversion tasks. ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly- colormapped displays, does better (though slower) color quantization than basic free JPEG software. Both above large, complex packages. just want simple image viewer, xloadimage xli. xloadimage supports JPEG latest release, 3.03. xloadimage free available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z. variant version xloadimage, said fans somewhat faster more robust than original. (The current indeed faster more robust than current xloadimage, least with respect JPEG files, because decoder while xloadimage 3.03 using hacked-over next xloadimage release will this.) also free available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z. Both programs said right thing with 24-bit displays. MS-DOS: This covers plain DOS- Windows OS/2 programs, next headings. good choice Eric Praetzel\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG files. current version, 2.5, available from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip. This good basic viewer that works either 386/486 machines. user interface flashy, it\'s functional. Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer Mohammad Rezaei\'s Hiview. current version, 1.2, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip. Hiview requires better VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 386MAX work- Windows OS/2 not). Hiview currently fastest viewer images that bigger than your screen. larger images, scales image down screen (rather than using panning/scrolling most viewers do). prefer this approach, there\'s denying that slows down loading large images considerably. Note: installation tricky- read directions carefully! shareware alternative ColorView ($30). This easier install than either freeware alternatives. user interface also much spiffier-looking, although personally find harder more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior. faster than DVPEG little slower than Hiview, least hardware. (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG ColorView seem about same speed, both faster than Hiview.) current version 2.1, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires VESA graphics driver- don\'t have one, look vesadrv2.zip vesa-tsr.zip from same directory. (Many recent have built-in VESA driver, don\'t load VESA driver unless ColorView complains that driver missing.) second shareware alternative Fullview, which been kicking around while, don\'t know stable archive location current (rather old) version inferior above viewers anyway. author tells that version Fullview will shortly will submitted Simtel20 archives that time. well-known viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG latest revision, 8.60a. However, CSHOW\'s JPEG implementation isn\'t very good: it\'s slow (about half speed above viewers) image quality poor except hi-color displays. it\'d have been nice good JPEG capability CSHOW. Shareware, $25. Available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip. remarkable variety graphics hardware, these viewers might work your particular machine. can\'t *any* them work, you\'ll need following conversion programs convert JPEG GIF, then view with your favorite viewer. have hi-color hardware, don\'t intermediate format- find TARGA-capable viewer instead. VPIC5.0 reputed right thing with hi-color displays.) Independent JPEG Group\'s free JPEG converters FTPable from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip jpeg4386.zip have extended memory). These files compilations free source code described section they will convert JPEG from GIF, Targa, formats. Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These slow limited conversion from format- particular, can\'t 24-bit color output from JPEG. major advantage these tools that they will read write HSI\'s proprietary JPEG format well Usenet-standard JFIF format. Since HSI-format files rather widespread BBSes, this useful capability. Version these tools free (prior versions were shareware). from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: format files posted Internet, since readable non-PC platforms. Handmade Software also shareware image conversion manipulation package, Image Alchemy. This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF formats) from many other image formats. also display images. demo version Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip. NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: Internet\'s archive site PC-related programs Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). Simtel20 runs non-Unix system with weird directory names- where this document refers directory (eg) msdos/graphics Simtel20, that really means pd1:<msdos.graphics>. physically MILnet, should expect rather slow transfer rates from Simtel20. There several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) Simtel20 archives- most users should mirror sites instead. popular mirror site oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files (eg) /pub/msdos/graphics. have capability, retrieve files from Simtel20 e-mail- informational postings comp.archives.msdos.announce find how. outside USA, consult same newsgroup learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror Microsoft Windows: There several Windows programs capable displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers generally slower than viewers same hardware, Windows\' system overhead. Note that conversion programs described above inside Windows window.) newest entry WinECJ, which free EXTREMELY fast. Version available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 256-or-more-colors mode. This no-frills viewer with habit hogging machine completely while decodes- image quality noticeably worse than other viewers. it\'s fast you\'ll anyway, least previewing... JView freeware, fairly fast, good on-line help, write decompressed image Windows format- can\'t create JPEG files, doesn\'t view GIFs. JView also lacks some other useful features shareware viewers (such brightness adjustment), it\'s excellent basic viewer. current version, 0.9, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors this archive found some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.) WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, image files- write these formats too, used converter. some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment slideshow. current version 2.1, available from Simtel20 mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip. (This slow 286-compatible version- register, you\'ll 386-only version, which roughly 25\% faster.) ColorView another shareware entry ($30).

QuickTime, need 68020 better need running System 6.0.7 later. you\'re running System must also install 32-bit QuickDraw extension- this built-in System QuickTime from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which better than several ways. With respect JPEG, marginally faster considerably less prone crash when corrupt JPEG file. However, some applications seem have compatibility problems with 1.5.) users should keep mind that QuickTime\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, same Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format. (See section details.) post images Usenet, make sure they JFIF format. Most programs mentioned below generate either format. first choice probably JPEGView, free program viewing images that JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, format. also convert between JPEG formats. current version, 2.0, improvement over prior versions. from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx. Requires System QuickTime. 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces best color image quality currently available JPEG viewers. JPEGView view large images much less memory than other viewers- fact, it\'s only that deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels typical Mac. Given large image, JPEGView automatically scales down screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers. (You zoom desired portion, though.) Some people like this behavior, some don\'t. Overall, JPEGView\'s user interface very well thought out. GIFConverter, shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF PICT/JPEG, well several other image formats. latest version 2.3.2. from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx. Requires System 6.0.5 later. GIFConverter better than JPEGView plain JPEG/GIF viewer, much more extensive image manipulation format conversion capabilities, find worth shareware playing around with images. Also, newest version GIFConverter load save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, your best your machine QuickTime. (But it\'s faster with QuickTime.) Note: GIFConverter runs memory trying load large JPEG, converting file with JPEG Convert, then viewing version. JPEG Convert, version free JPEG conversion utilities, available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will Mac, only does file conversion, viewing. conjunction with viewer. Previous versions this recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, JPEG<=>GIF converter based version code. using this program, definitely should replace with JPEG Convert. Apple\'s free program PictPixie view images JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, format, convert between these formats. PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime. PictPixie intended developer\'s tool, it\'s really best choice unless like fool around with QuickTime. Some drawbacks that requires lots memory, produces relatively poor color image quality anything less than 24-bit display, relatively unfriendly user interface. Worse, PictPixie unsupported program, meaning some minor bugs that Apple does intend fix. (There version PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around net. have this should trash it\'s even buggier. Also, QuickTime Starter includes much cleaned-up descendant PictPixie called Picture Compressor. Note that Picture Compressor free distributed net.) Storm Technology\'s Picture Decompress free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather program inferior above programs many ways, will without System QuickTime, forced older systems. does need 32-bit QuickDraw, really machines can\'t it.) from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx. must file type downloaded image file \'JPEG\' allow Picture Decompress open your machine 32-bit QuickDraw Plus instance), GIFConverter your only choice single-program JPEG viewing. don\'t want GIFConverter, JPEG Convert free viewer.

Most people don\'t have full-color pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores fewer bits pixel, display fewer distinct colors time. display full-color image, computer must image into appropriate representative colors. This process called color quantization. (This something misnomer, color selection would better term. We\'re stuck with standard usage though.) Clearly, color quantization lossy process. turns that most images, details color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact final image quality than errors introduced JPEG (except very lowest JPEG quality settings). Since JPEG full-color format, converting color JPEG image display 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization. This true *all* color JPEGs: even feed 256-or-less-color into JPEG, what comes decompressor *not* colors, thousands colors. This happens because JPEG\'s lossiness affects each pixel little differently, pixels that started with identical colors will probably come with slightly different colors. Each original color gets smeared into group nearby colors. Therefore quantization always required display color JPEG colormapped display, regardless image source. only avoid quantization gray-scale output. (Incidentally, because this effect it\'s nearly meaningless talk about number colors used JPEG image. Even attempted count number distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give different results because roundoff error differences. occasionally posted images described 256-color JPEG. This tells that poster hasn\'t read this probably converted JPEG from GIF. JPEGs classified color gray-scale (just like photographs), number colors just isn\'t useful concept JPEG.) other hand, image definition already been quantized fewer colors. *does* have definite number colors palette, format doesn\'t allow more than palette entries.) purposes Usenet picture distribution, advantage that sender precomputes color quantization, recipients don\'t have This also *disadvantage* GIF: you\'re stuck with sender\'s quantization. sender quantized different number colors than what display, have re-quantize, resulting much poorer image quality than quantized once from full-color image. Furthermore, sender didn\'t high-quality color quantization algorithm, you\'re luck. this reason, JPEG offers promise significantly better image quality users whose machines don\'t match sender\'s display hardware. JPEG\'s full color image quantized precisely match user\'s display hardware. Furthermore, will able take advantage future improvements quantization algorithms (there active research this area), purchase better display hardware, better view JPEG images already have. With GIF, you\'re stuck forevermore with what sent. It\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines. view 256-color 16-color display, example, probably getting much worse image than need This partly inevitable consequence doing color quantizations (one create GIF, display it), often it\'s also sloppiness. JPEG conversion programs will forced high quality quantizers order acceptable results all, normal they will quantize directly number colors displayed. Thus, JPEG likely provide better results than average program low-color-resolution displays well high-resolution ones! Finally, ever-growing number people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit hi-color displays, true 24-bit displays workstations Macintoshes, etc. these people, already obsolete, cannot represent image full capabilities their display. JPEG images drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG all-around better choice than representing images machine-independent fashion. does JPEG work? buzz-words know chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, Huffman arithmetic entropy coding. This article\'s long enough already, I\'m going more than that here. technical information, comp.compression FAQ. This available from news.answers archive rtfm.mit.edu, files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3]. need help using news.answers archive, this article. What about lossless JPEG? There\'s great deal confusion this subject. JPEG committee define truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., that guarantees final output bit-for-bit identical original input. However, this lossless mode almost nothing common with regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, offers much less compression. present, very implementations lossless JPEG exist, them commercial. Saying free JPEG software DOES lossless image. What does deliberate information loss coefficient quantization step. There still good deal information loss color subsampling step. (With free JPEG code, also -sample turn subsampling. Keep mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with resulting file.) Even with both quantization subsampling turned off, regular JPEG algorithm lossless, because subject roundoff errors various calculations. maximum error counts pixel value- it\'s highly unlikely that this could perceived human eye, might concern doing machine processing image. this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that perhaps half size uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image. True lossless JPEG provides roughly same amount compression, guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy. have application requiring lossless storage images with less than bits pixel (per color component), want look into JBIG bilevel image compression standard. This performs better than JPEG lossless such images. JPEG lossless superior JBIG images with more bits pixel- furthermore, JPEG public domain least with Huffman back end), while JBIG techniques heavily covered patents. [10] argument about file formats? Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only family compression algorithms- does *not* refer specific image file format. JPEG committee prevented from defining file format turf wars within international standards organizations. Since can\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless agree common file format, this leaves with problem. absence official standards, number JPEG program writers have just gone their thing, result their programs aren\'t compatible with anybody else\'s. closest thing have de-facto standard JPEG format some work that\'s been coordinated people C-Cube Microsystems. They have defined JPEG-based file formats: JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), low-end format that transports pixels much else. TIFF/JPEG, TIFF 6.0, extension Aldus TIFF format. TIFF high-end format that will record just about everything ever wanted know about image, more besides :-). TIFF more complex than JFIF, well prove less transportable, because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different incompatible subsets TIFF. It\'s likely that adding JPEG will anything improve this situation. Both these formats were developed with input from major vendors JPEG-related products- it\'s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere both standards. believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF replacement picture postings. JFIF simpler than TIFF available now- TIFF spec only recently been officially adopted, still unusably vague some crucial details. Even when TIFF/JPEG well defined, JFIF format likely widely supported lowest common denominator- TIFF/JPEG files never transportable. particular case that people interested Apple\'s QuickTime software Macintosh. QuickTime uses JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside Mac-specific PICT structure. Conversion between JFIF QuickTime JPEG pretty straightforward, several programs available (see portion section 6A). have editor that handles binary files, strip QuickTime JPEG PICT down JFIF hand- section details. Another particular case Handmade Software\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF Image Alchemy). These programs capable reading writing JFIF format. default, though, they write proprietary format developed HSI. This format readable non-HSI programs should used Usenet postings. switch JFIF output. (This applies versions these programs- current releases emit JFIF format default. still should careful post HSI-format files, unless want flamed people non-PC platforms.) [11] recognize which file format have, what about have alleged JPEG file that your software won\'t read, it\'s likely format some other proprietary JPEG-based format. tell what have inspecting first bytes file: JFIF-standard file will start with characters (hex) followed variable bytes (often 10), followed \'JFIF\'. start, rest have JPEG file. This probably decodable as-is JFIF software it\'s worth try, anyway. files start with \'hsi1\'. You\'re luck unless have software. Portions file look like plain JPEG data, they won\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs. Macintosh PICT file, JPEG-compressed, will have couple hundred bytes header followed JFIF header (scan \'JFIF\'). Strip everything before should able read Anything else: it\'s proprietary format, JPEG all. lucky, file consist header JPEG data stream. identify start JPEG data stream (look D8), stripping everything before that. uuencoded Usenet postings, characteristic JFIF pattern \tbegin line \tM_]C_X whereas uuencoded files will start with \tbegin line \tM:\'-I learn check former, save yourself trouble downloading non-JFIF files. [12] What about arithmetic coding? JPEG spec defines different back modules final output compressed data: either Huffman coding arithmetic coding allowed. choice impact image quality, arithmetic coding usually produces smaller compressed file. typical images, arithmetic coding produces file percent smaller than Huffman coding. (All file-size numbers previously cited Huffman coding.) Unfortunately, particular variant arithmetic coding specified JPEG standard subject patents owned IBM, AT&T, Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally arithmetic coding* unless obtain licenses from these companies. (The fair doctrine allows people implement test algorithm, actually storing images with dubious best.) least short run, recommend that people worry about arithmetic coding- space savings isn\'t great enough justify potential legal hassles. particular, arithmetic coding *should not* used images exchanged Usenet. There some small chance that legal situation change future. Stay tuned further details. [13] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression? would nice having compressed image with JPEG, could decompress manipulate (crop border, say), recompress without further image degradation beyond what lost initially. Unfortunately THIS CASE. general, recompressing altered image loses more information, though usually much lost first time around. next best thing would that decompress image recompress *without changing then there further loss, i.e., identical JPEG file. Even this true- least, with current free JPEG software. It\'s essentially problem accumulation roundoff error. repeatedly compress decompress, image will eventually degrade where visible changes from first-generation output. usually takes many such cycles visible change.) things to-do list accumulation error avoided limited, optimistic about case, most that could possibly guaranteed would that compressing unmodified full-color output djpeg, original quality setting, would introduce further loss. Even such simple changes cropping border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. you\'re wondering why, it\'s because pixel-block boundaries move. cropped only multiples pixels, might safe, that\'s mighty limited capability!) bottom line that JPEG useful format archival storage transmission images, don\'t want intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps. lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working image, then JPEG when ready file away. Aside from avoiding degradation, will save compression/decompression time this :-). [14] What some rules thumb converting images JPEG? stated earlier, *will* lose some amount image information convert existing image JPEG. obtain original full-color data made from, it\'s better make JPEG from that. need save space have only work from, here some suggestions getting maximum space savings with minimum loss quality. first rule when converting library look each JPEG, make sure happy with before throwing away corresponding GIF- that will give chance re-do conversion with higher quality setting necessary. Some GIFs better left GIFs, explained section particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen fewer colors don\'t convert well. find that JPEG file reasonable quality will *larger* than GIF. check sizes too.) Experience date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs best candidates conversion JPEG. They chew most storage offer most potential savings, they convert JPEG with least degradation. Don\'t waste your time converting much under Kbytes. Also, don\'t expect JPEG files converted from GIFs small those created directly from full-color originals. maintain image quality have converted files much twice straight-through JPEG files would (i.e., shoot 1/3rd size file, 1/4th suggested earlier comparisons). Many people have developed habit putting large constant-color border around image. While useless, this nearly free terms storage cost files. free JPEG files, sharp border boundary create visible artifacts (ghost edges). yourself favor crop border before JPEGing. Windows system, XV\'s manual automatic cropping functions very painless this.) cjpeg\'s default setting appropriate full-color input, inputs, settings often seem necessary avoid image degradation. apply smoothing suggested below, higher setting necessary.) Color GIFs photographs complex artwork usually dithered fool your into seeing more than colors that actually store. enlarge image, will that adjacent pixels often significantly different colors- normal size averages these pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value. trouble with dithering that, JPEG, looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise- JPEG can\'t compress noise very well. resulting JPEG file both larger lower image quality than what would have gotten from JPEGing original full color image it). around this, want smooth image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating color that thought anyway, process getting rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble. Appropriate smoothing will often avoid using high factor, thus further reducing size compressed file, while still obtaining better-looking output image than you\'d without smoothing. With free JPEG software products based it), simple smoothing capability built -smooth when converting GIFs. Values seem work well high-quality GIFs. Heavy-handed dithering require larger smoothing factors. regular fine-scale patterns image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing definitely called for.) large smoothing factor will blur output image, which don\'t want. image processing wizard, also smoothing with separate filtering program, such pnmconvol from PBMPLUS package. However, cjpeg\'s built-in smoother faster than pnmconvol... upshot this that cjpeg -quality -smooth probably good starting point converting GIFs. really care about image, you\'ll want check results maybe other settings. --------------------- more information about JPEG general free JPEG software particular, contact Independent JPEG Group jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.;1

There four slightly different formats again, them would have been adequate. images stored pixel component, complexity without function, etc, etc. also note that TIFF says that Aldus\' experiments show that reliably compresses well better than formats, suggesting that none formats really useful. What\'s worse, formats aren\'t even implemented very well, e.g., limits code words bits, while bits would have provided substantially better compression. method compresses bytes rather than pixels. absolute worst thing about TIFF that vendor register proprietary TIFF codes formats without even publicly documenting them.

463;'THE DIVINE MASTERS Most Christians would agree, correctly that Jesus Christ Divine Master, projection into physical world, Incarnate. there some very important related facts that Christians COMPLETELY IGNORANT followers most other world religions. First, Jesus Christ unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH- STANDING. There ALWAYS least such Divine Master (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE this world TIMES, continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before after life Jesus. followers some these Masters founded world\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING teachings their Master process. Christians, example, added THREATS ETERNAL DAMNATION Hell, DELETED teaching REincarnation. Secondly, more importantly, after particular Master physically dies leaves this world, there NOTHING that ANYbody except relatively people that INITIATED while still PHYSICALLY alive. (THAT SIMPLY THINGS UNIVERSES.) Therefore, those Christians worship Jesus, pray Jesus, expect Jesus return save them from their sins, only KIDDING THEMSELVES, have allowed themselves DUPED religion that mostly MANUFACTURED Romans. emotional feelings TOTALLY DECEIVING indicator religious validity. These things similarly true followers most other major world religions, including Islam. Thirdly, primary function each Master tune Initiates into AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM SOUND CURRENT, (referred WORD John 1:1-5, River Life Revelation 22:1), personally guide each them thru upper levels Heaven while they still connected their living physical bodies silver cord.

Many Christians likely confuse Masters with Anti-Christ, which temporary world dictator during so-called last days. Masters don\'t ever rule, even when asked expected Jesus was. People continue following Christianity, Islam, other orthodox religions with physically-DEAD Master, will CONTINUE their cycles REincarnation, between Psychic Planes this MISERABLE physical world, until they finally accept Initiation from PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine Master. RE-INCARNATION book HERE HEREAFTER, Ruth Montgomery, describes several kinds evidence supporting REincarnation FACT LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS past lives [about 50\% accurate- subconscious mind sometimes makes things especially with hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially young children, some whom identify their most recent previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL past life experi- ences, DEJA (familiarity with land while travel- there first time vacation), psychic read- ings late EDGAR CAYCE, EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John Baptist REINCARNATION Elias.)

Readers here aside theologizing jargon (such slaves Christ) point that adherents religion *will* read texts (whether classified inspired not) that held models, effort find application their situations. This practice ranges from devotional reading sermons like exegesis canon- ical scripture Word God. highest pitch, this leads question whether *can* find inspired scripture something that absolute guidance actions. problem finding just *what* Lord commands. going aside this essay major direction which Christians have looked these commands, namely Christian tradition. That because reject tradition, because primary audience this essay Protestants, deny tradition determinative value, favor witness Scripture. question want deal with WHAT commandments find from Lord Scripture? that turns hard question. Protestant Inquisitors would *like* turn discussion authority tradition, accomodate them :-), unlike *most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from Scripture Reason Tradition roughly equal standing.

This general problem reading these texts cannot read them without *own* understanding native languages which (normally) read (translated) texts, without *some* appreciation original context (and points, original languages, when English misleads us.) going presume, what follows, that have *general* problem read scripture under control don\'t *really* think this true, will suffice current purposes. will address ONLY issues that arise when have already coped with understanding 2000 year text from another world than live Questions THAT level only introduce MORE reser- vations about commandments issue than will found stipulating that read texts original audience might have done. Among reasons have seeing John\'s _agapate allelou_ *general* commandment (not merely instruction Jesus this disciples that occasion), linking Synoptic Great Commandment that have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting love those whom congenially associate with. Matthew 5:43ff read, have learnt you: love your enemies. fact, Leviticus context quoted does \'hate your enemy\' merely common human presumption. (And Leviticus pains that love should extend strangers amongst people Israel.) Luke, expanding this same context, goes have Jesus say. Even sinners love those love them. [6:27] this suggests [quite strongly, I\'d :-)] that *limiting* scope commandment quite what Jesus mind. short, inference *leads generalizing actual text command that force Christians, with objects limited other Christians. Trickier than _agapate allelou_ Institution communion, there case Great Commission where (Matthew Mark Twelve sent evangelize, Proclaim that kingdom heaven close hand. verb imperative (_ke:russete_), context rather specific Twelve, there further specifiers turn your steps pagan territory, enter Samaritan town Lukan parallels even more specific Jesus\' final journey Jerusalem) which make harder this generalizing Christians than previous examples. That hasn\'t prevented Christians from MAKING such inference- what have call attention that such inference justified text, (unlike first cases cite) rhetoric evangelist urged reader. Still, Paul seems have felt obliged proclaim that kingdom heaven close hand even (contrary Jesus\' instructions :-)) gentiles, ends earth. Christians after have also taken this commandment sense John 14:15. accept this? don\'t know. surely rather speculative. ripples inference spread from text that pretext Christians (may) infer general commandment, applicable all, from what presented gospels specific occasion.

Let\'s move Great Commandment that should love with whole hearts minds souls. This perhaps, Synoptic equivalent John\'s _agapate allelou_. yet, PRESENTED commandment, texts. Rather, context controversy with Pharisees. cite Matthew [22:34ff] \tBut when Pharisees heard that silenced Sadducees \tthey together and, disconcert him, them question, \tMaster, which greatest commandment Law? means obvious here (though accept such) that Jesus\' answer meant commandment Christians*. answering polemic from enemies.

Christians would disagree with conclusions *must* point that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* rather elaborate chains reasoning that simply present texts, themselves. contextual problem keeps coming more more severely look those sayings Jesus that universally taken Christians commandments. some really hard cases. Take divorce. Mark pretty clear, divorces wife marries another guilty adultery against her. 10:11, Luke 16:18 except that Matthew escape clause except case fornication, 5:31 This seems rather clear commandment (whether take Matthew\'s reservation)- some Christians, this day, take some don\'t, least practice. This rather peculiar- Jesus were explicit about this (whereas says nothing about some things people gnash their teeth over.) possible, commands Christ clear, that Matthew disagree with other evangelists synoptic tradition? I\'m going continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, this enough start with. theme finding commandments scripture exercise inference- inferences informed assumptions, that cultural biases. have, far, identified very commandments that generally accepted Christians these, already, some difficulties start surface. these difficulties want discuss next essay this topic. divorce commandment already strikes some difficulties: almost evidence that people eager find commandments condemn *me* with, spend time writing nasty screeds soc.couples misc.legal about horrors viciousness divorce, demanding that refuse allow refuse unrepentant divorcees places their churches.

When this slams into surrounding medium, strong flux non-thermal gamma rays results, which carry substantial fraction initial total energy. this idea: series papers Martin Rees, Peter Meszaros (sorry missing accents:-) co-workers. certainly complete model, well best around (summing over proposed distance scales). alternative proposal what creates initial fireball, way, so-called \'failed supernovae\' scenario Stan Woosley, which very massive star life collapses black hole. stellar core rotating, part infalling matter will temporarily halted because supported centrifugal force, form very dense neutron torus that accretes onto black hole. This beast spew along rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. rate such events much higher than that neutron star mergers, flux more strongly beamed, that rate bursts observed Earth stays same between scenarios, energy released event less failed supernova scenario. another note: believe that distance scale must ultimately resolved some classical astronomical method such finding counterparts bursts other wavelengths, finding definitive signature some known class objects distribution positions fluxes.

V.A. Weldon L.E. Fink from Boeing. paper describes propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel. Basically, it\'s high-speed airplane launching Hermes-type spaceplane design (the concept also called Beta) laid paper launch least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, 20,000 pounds space station orbit including crew eight persons life support. System design reliability .9995.

They conclude while SSTO slightly lower recurring cost, TSTO easier, cheaper, less risky develop, simpler build, greater safety mission versatility doesn\'t carry hard-to-handle bulky hydrogen fuel. conlcude conjunction with major airplane type engines fuel, well inherent self- ferry capability, probably system most likely provide close airline-like operations possible with practical configuration, until single stage airbreather/rocket concept shown operationally viable.

Redesign Activities Update Following weekly status redesign, based information provided NASA headquarters. station Redesign Team (SRT) provided detailed status report Advisory Committee Redesign Space Station April day-long meeting held ANSER facilities Crystal City, topics covered included preliminary mission goals statement space station- science, technology engineering research- assessment process- design approach. Discussions management options operations concepts also were held. Design Teams then presented three options under study: Option Modular Buildup Pete Priest presented option. Priest said team working define station that meets cost goals identified three distinct phases evolution power station, human tended permanent presence. team will define minimum capability needed achieve each phase, total cost each phase achievable capability budget levels. option uses current simplified Freedom hardware where cost effective considering other existing systems such so-called Bus-1 spacecraft, orbiter Spacelab. Power Station Capability could achieved flights with Freedom photo voltaic modules providing power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab missions docked power station assumed this phase. Human Tended Capability would provided addition U.S. Common Module Module which adds subsystems payload racks docking ports Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with orbiter docked station assumed this phase. Different operation/utilization modes being studied this phase. Option Freedom Derived Mike Griffin presented status Option activities. Griffin detailed evolution Freedom-derived option, from initial Research Capability, Human-Tended Capability, Permanent Human Presence Capability, Fault Tolerance, finally Permanent Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes baseline program, with minor changes Communications Tracking system, Crew Health Care System ECLSS, major change Data Management System. Initial Research Capability would achieved with flights 28.5 degree inclination flights 51.6 degrees) consist extended duration orbiter-Spacelab combination docked truss segment with photo voltaic arrays providing 18.75 power. Human-Tended Capability would achieved flights truss segments U.S. lab. Permanent Human Presence Capability would achieved flights with orbiters providing habitation assured crew return. Fault Tolerance, achieved flights, would build other section truss with another modules, thermal control propulsion systems. freedom derived configuration could achieve International Complete state with flights. Three more flights, bring habitat module, third array Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete Permanent Human Capability with International stage. Griffin told Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware would not, itself, meet budget guidelines Freedom derived option. Major reductions deferrals must occur other areas including program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization operations costs, said. Option Singe Launch Core Station Chet Vaughn presented Option Single Launch Core Station concept. Shuttle external tank solid rocket boosters would used launch station into orbit. Shuttle main engines would mounted tail station module launch jettisoned after separation. module, feet diameter feet long, would provide 26,000 cubic feet pressured volume, separated into decks connected centralized passageway. Seven berthing ports would located various places circumference module place international modules, other elements. This would have fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately power flying solar interial attitude. closing comments Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\'Connor said design freeze would established options April that detailed costing options begin. next meeting with Redesign Advisory Committee will Russian Consultants Arrive U.S. delegation Russian space experts arrived U.S. April briefings members Russian team began 22nd. group includes Russian Space Agency General Director Koptev, Yatsenko, also RSA.

About fifteen minutes into movie, there\'s sequence where Earth shuttle approaching space station. Specifically, digitized portion about seconds\' duration, zooming rotating space station. figured this would give reasonable amount movement between frames. increase differences between frames, digitized only frames second, give total frames. captured footage resolution 384*288 pixels with Spigot card Centris (quarter-size resolution from source). then imported into Premiere through Compact Video compressor, keeping frame rate. created versions movie: scaled 320*240 resolution, other 160*120 resolution. used default 2.00 quality setting Premiere 2.0.1, specified frame every frames. then 320*240 movie through same Speed Test program used results I\'d been reporting earlier. Result: playback rate over frames second. That\'s right, getting much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just fun, copied 320*240 movie external hard disk Quantum LP105S), from there. This time playback rate only about frames second.

This equivalent descibing polygon with holes. renderer will then make appropriate hole since interior polygon edges opposite direction outside edges. want this simplistic system since: \t1) will handle outline fonts properly simple \t\tmatter connect outer outline inner outline \t\tsome fancy fonts). \t2) does properly handle even/odd non-winding rules.

These trapezoidal polygons then easily properly rendered scanline renderer. question there better solutions turning outlines into polgyons other than trapezoid decomposer? fond this solution since creates excess number polygons.

Moreover, none histories I\'ve read ever made mention Hitler anyone else ever using homosexuality pretext purging Roehm. point reiterated that Hitler party covered these accusations. going accuse official history being fabrication, should least your facts right. pretext purging Roehm that planning coup against Hitler. Nowhere there mention using allegations homosexuality pretext purge, justification afterwards possible that histories I\'ve read have mentioned this, doubt would Hitler\'s best interest admit world that former right hand homosexual?).

Since Nazis never officially charged Roehm with homosexuality least, according what I\'ve read), I\'d like know what tainted evidence talking about. Since accusations were made persons outside Nazi party, long before came power, those accusations were common knowledge journalists others Germany 1920\'s 30\'s, just would possible Nazis back time plant tainted evidence? exactly does doctor newspapers which were circulated around world, without discrepancies being obvious? What actual incidences Nazi doctoring evidence this matter know about? what about testimony people were involved these matters, some whom were Nazis? what point making false accusation homosexuality publicize Since point here seems discredit established history, then burden proof falls revisionist. revisionists better their homework before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts. This just about *only* thing agree suspect that notion that there might have been people Roehm buddies were homosexuals must disturb some people. feeling seems that nasty individual accused homosexuality, that this must attempt bash homosexuals. This fear often justified what lies behind this distrust official history, seems this good justification trashing accepted accounts this subject. really think that historians incompetent, don\'t write them where they their sources this subject, can\'t tell from their footnotes?

April 6th, Rocky Nelson MacDonnell Douglas gave talk entitled Optimizing Techniques Advanced Space Missions here University Illinois. Nelson\'s involves using software simulate trajectories determine optimal trajectory within given requirements. Although directly involved with Delta Clipper project, spent time with them recently, using software their applications. thus used DC-Y project most examples. While don\'t think details implicit trajectory simulation much interest readers hope they aren\'t fell asleep during that part), think that many will interested some details gleaned from examples. first example given maximization payload polar orbit. main restriction that acceleration must remain below assume that this driven passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, verify that. Delta Clipper version engines boosters sustainers. boosters, which have lower isp, shut down mid-flight. Thus, critical question when shut them down. Nelson showed following plot acceleration time: ______ ASCII graphs this actually fairly good. difference that lines made should curves which concave data only approximate, graph wasn\'t very long. ~100 ~400 mentioned before, critical constraint that levels must kept below Initially, eight engines started. vehicle burns fuel accelleration increases. gets close booster engines throtled back. However, they quickly become inefficient power, soon makes more sense them altogether. This causes accelleration about seconds. Eventually remaining sustainer engines bring level back about then hold there until they entirely. engine cutoff does acutally occur orbit. trajectory aimed altitude slightly higher than 100nm desired last vestiges drag slow vehicle slightly, thus lowering final altitude that desired. Questions from audience: (paraphrased) Would make sense shut down booster engines pairs, rather than once? Very perceptive. Worth considering. They have done simulation. Shutting down four part problem given. what final payload this trajectory?

Then take catalog bursts that have been recieved from various satellites around solar system, (Pioneer Venus one, either Pion. GINGA, course BATSE) distribution tests catalog.

Now, suppose saying, Well, stil only sampling from inside disk. Well, necessarily.

Zoroastrian doctrine Savior Future (Saoshyant) basis story coming Magi Bethlehem _Gospel Matthew_ (2:1-12).] Persian word magu, rendered Greek magos, uncertain etymology. originally have meant member tribe, Avestan compound mogu-tbish (hostile member tribe). This meaning would have been further resticted, among Medes, member priestly tribe perhaps priest (Benveniste, 1938- Boyce, 1982). term probably Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions Magoi tribes Medes. variety reasons consider Magi have been members priestly tribe Median origin western Iran. Among Persians, they were responsible liturgical functions, well maintaining their knowledge holy occult. Most likely, supremacy Median priesthood western Iran became established during time Median monarchy that dominated Persians from eighth century through first half sixth century until revolt Cyrus Great (550 BCE). Persians were indebted Medes their political civil institutions well. Even hypotheses have been advanced concerning existence Magi Persian origin Achaemenid period (Boyce, 1982), must still maintain that they were Median origin. This demonstrated eposide revolt Gaumata Magian, mentioned Darius (522-486 BCE) inscription Bisutun (Iran), well Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists idea usurpatory power Medes against Persians through conspiracy Magi. fact that Magi have been members tribe that handed down sacerdotal arts hereditary fashion naturally exclude possibility that some them undertook secular prefessions. This seems attested Elamite tablets Persepolis. There theses, forth Giuseppe Messina, that denies that Magi members ethnic group suggesting that they simply members priesthood priesthood purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis untenable- other hand, hypothesis that their name related Avestan term magavan, derived from Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, gift), without foundation (Mole, 1963). meaning maga probably found, conformity with Pahlavi tradition, within context concept purity, separation mixture opposed principles spirit matter. maga, which been erroneously interpreted chorus, from root mangh, which said mean sing magic song (Nyberg, 1966) been rendered simply expression like unio mystica, seems ecstatic condition that opens mind spiritual vision. case, though there relation between Persian term magu Avestan terms magavan maga, must maintain clear distinction between Magi Avestan priesthood. Avesta ignores Median Persian term, despite recent hypothesis proposed H.W. Bailey- Persian inscriptions ignore Avestan term priest, athravan (Vedic, athravan), even this perhaps present Achaeminid setting Elamite tablets Persepolis (Gershevitch, 1964). term magu been present Zoroastrianism throughout history- Pahlavi terms mogh-mard mobad represent continuation. latter particular derives from older form, magupati (head Magi). During Sasanid period (third seventh centuries CE), which formation hierarchically organized church, title mobadan mobad (the high priest high priests) came used designate summit ecclesiastical hierarchy. Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, khvaetvadatha (Av.- Pahl., khwedodah). They also performed characteristic funeral rite: exposure corpse animals vultures remove flesh thereby cleanse corpse supposed decompose, lest contaminated demons putrefaction. This practice later became typical entire Zoroastrian community rise complex funeral ritual Iran among Parsis India. Stone towers, known dakhmas, were built especially this rite. During time Herodotus practice exposure corpse vogue only among Magi- Persians generally sprinkled corpse with wax, then buried practice widespread, however, among peoples Central Asia. Magi were technicians experts worship: impossible offer sacrifices without presence Magus. During performance ritual sacrifice, Magus sang theogony (the Magi were possibly custodians tradition sacred poetry, know nothing about relationship this tradition various parts Avesta) called upon interpret dreams divine future. Magi were also known practice killing harmful, Ahrimanical, animals (khrafstra) such snakes ants. They dressed Median style, wearing pants, tunics, coats with sleeves. They wore characteristic head covering felt (Gr. tiara) with strips sides that could used cover nose mouth during rituals avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath (Boyce, 1982). color these caps, conformity with tradition that probably Indo-European origin, according Georges Dumezil, that priesthood: white. likelihood, during Achaemenid period Magi were possession well-defined body doctrine, probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism- they were most likely clergy consisting professional priests were tied rigid orthodoxy were naturally inclined eclecticism syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been jealous guardians patrimony Zorastrian traditions. virtue this they were educators royal princes. wisest them responsible teaching prince magic Zarathushtra, Horomazes thus cult gods. Magi excelled other virtues were entrusted with education prince that would learn just, courageous, master himself. During Achaemenid period Magi maintained position great influence, although they were certainly subordinate emperor. Despite several dramatic events such massacre they suffered after death Gaumata Magian which, according Herodotus (who calls himself Smerdis), Persians killed large number Magi avenge usurpation Magi nevertheless managed maintain their influence court Media, Persia, various regions empire where they were stationed consequence Persian civilian military administration. priesthood antiquity more famous than that Magi. They were renowned followers Zarathushtra (Zoroaster)- teachers some greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato)- wise arrived, guided star, manger newborn savior Bethlehem- propagators cult India. they were also known Chaldeans, priesthood Babylon, known occultism- this perhaps reason that term magos pejorative sense Greek, like goes, expert magic arts (Bidez Cumont, 1938). Indeed, Chaldeans were experts types magical arts, especially astrology, reputation wisdom well knowledge. understand reasons such various sometimes discordant views, necessary distinguish between Magi Iran proper so-called western Magi, were later hellenized. Achaemenid period both must have been least part Zoroastrian, western Magi (those Iranian diaspora Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, Armenia), came contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner later varying degrees, been influenced syncretic concepts. Greeks were familiar with both kinds Magi and, depending their varying concerns, would emphasize other aspect them. Classical historians geographers, including Herodotus Strabo, document their customs, while philosophers dwell above their doctrines: dualism, belief hereafter, Magian cosmology cosmogony, their theology eschatology. Those sources most interested doctrines Magi even speak Zarathushtra Magus. doing they repeating what Magi themselves said from Median Achaemenid periods, when they adopted Zoroastrianism. that time they embraced Zarathushtra their placed themselves under venerable name.

(This collection texts from various periods primarily concerned with purificatory rules practices.) Nonetheless, hypothesis hardly plausible, since first chapter Vendidad list sixteen lands created Ahura Mazda, supreme Zoroastrianism, contaminated attack Ahriman (Pahl.- Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), other supreme ultimate source evil suffering does mention western Iran, Persia, Media (the land Ragha mentioned text cannot Median Raghiana). Furthermore, been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that authors been Magi absence reference western Iranian institutions, including their priesthood, would very strange. Magi were above means which Zoroastrian tradition corpus Avesta have been transmitted from second half first millennium This been their principal merit. attribute directly Magi formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known especially from Greek sources and, part, from Pahlavi literature ninth tenth centuries According this formulation, poles dualism longer, Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (beneficent spirit) Angra Mainyu (hostile spirit) Ahura Mazda himself Angra Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964).

IDCT based Chen-Wang multiplication algorithm (not quite optimum, know). Blocks with more than eight non-zero coefficients non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT (sounds great, doesn\'t it?), which turned faster than \'fast\' algorithm this (quite common) case. Dithering pretty standard. Main difference Berkeley decoder (except fewer number supported algorithms) instead colors, (default) option restricted color-space implementation color saturation dominant ordered dither. This leads significantly superior quality dithered image claim, judge yourself). Restricted color-space means that components clipped +/-0.25 (instead +/-0.5) display color-space points distributed over this restricted space. Since distance between color-space points thus reduced factor two, color resolution doubled expense being able represent fully saturated colors. Saturation dominant ordered dither method which color, lying somewhere between points display color space, approximated primarily alternating between points constant instead constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality lower sensitivity human viewing system saturation changes than changes (the same reasoning used standard improve NTSC). improvement particularly visible dark brown redish areas.;1

Feature description HIPS image processing modules which together provide powerful suite tools those interested research, system development teaching. handles sequences images (movies) precisely same manner single frames. Programs subroutines have been developed simple image transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier other transform processing, edge detection line drawing manipulation, digital image compression transmission methods, noise generation, image statistics computation. Over such image transformation programs have been developed. result, almost image processing task performed quickly conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows users easily integrate their custom routines. users become effective using HIPS their first day. HIPS features images that self-documenting. Each image stored system contains history transformations that have been applied that image. HIPS includes small subroutines which primarily deals with standardized image sequence header, large library image transformation tools form UNIX ``filters\'\'. comes complete with source code, on-line manual pages, on-line documentation. Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed York University, HIPS represents most extensive flexible vision image processing environments currently available. runs under UNIX operating system. modular flexible, provides automatic documentation actions, almost entirely independent special equipment.

While Jesus uncreated, Creator things: beginning Word, Word with God, Word God. same beginning with God. things were made him- without thing made that made. (John 1:1-3) before things, things consist. (Colossians 1:17) Your inference from Ezekiel John passages that Lucifer created that Jesus depends particular interpetation word create with which many Christians agree. Granted Mormon belief that God\'s children (including Christ Lucifer) eternally existent intelligences which were organized into spirit children God, term creation apply equally well both those passages. Just briefly, something that mentioned passing. refer differing interpretations create, that many Christians agree. what?

82;'Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: April 1993 Version: Constructing Logical Argument Although there much argument Usenet, general quality argument found poor. This article attempts provide gentle introduction logic, hope improving general level debate. Logic science reasoning, proof, thinking, inference [Concise OED]. Logic allows analyze piece reasoning determine whether correct (valid invalid). course, does need study logic order reason correctly- nevertheless, little basic knowledge logic often helpful when constructing analyzing argument. Note that claim being made here about whether logic universally applicable. matter very much open debate. This document merely explains logic, given that have already decided that logic right tool job. Propositions statements) building blocks logical argument. proposition statement which either true false- example, raining Today Tuesday. Propositions either asserted (said true) denied (said false). Note that this technical meaning deny, everyday meaning. proposition meaning statement, particular arrangement words used express exists There exists both express same proposition. argument quote Monty Python sketch, connected series statements establish definite proposition. argument consists three stages. First all, propositions which necessary argument continue stated. These called premises argument. They evidence reasons accepting argument conclusions. Premises assertions) often indicated phrases such because, since, obviously (The phrase obviously often viewed with suspicion, used intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises. something doesn\'t seem obvious you, don\'t afraid question always yes, you\'re right, obvious when you\'ve heard explanation.) Next, premises used derive further propositions process known inference. inference, proposition arrived basis more other propositions already accepted. There various forms valid inference. propositions arrived inference then used further inference. Inference often denoted phrases such implies that therefore. Finally, arrive conclusion argument proposition which affirmed basis premises inference. Conclusions often indicated phrases such therefore, follows that, conclude conclusion often stated final stage inference. example: Every event cause (premise) universe beginning (premise) beginnings involve event (premise) This implies that beginning universe involved event (inference) Therefore universe cause (inference conclusion) Note that conclusion argument might premise another argument. proposition only called premise conclusion with respect particular argument- terms make sense isolation. Sometimes argument will follow order given above- example, conclusions might stated first premises stated afterwards support conclusion. This perfectly valid, sometimes little confusing. Recognizing argument much harder than recognizing premises conclusions. Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which might reasonably describe argument. Some statements look like arguments, not. example: Bible accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, evil liar, God. This argument, conditional statement. does assert premises which necessary support what appears conclusion. also suffers from number other logical flaws, we\'ll come those later.) Another example: created you- therefore your duty God. phrase your duty proposition, since neither true false. Therefore conclusion, sentence argument. Finally, causality important. Consider statement form because we\'re interested establishing offered evidence, statement argument. we\'re trying establish truth then argument, explanation. example: There must something wrong with engine car, because will start. This argument. will start because there something wrong with engine. This explanation. There traditional types argument, deductive inductive. deductive argument which provides conclusive proof conclusions that argument where premises true, conclusion must also true. deductive argument either valid invalid. valid argument defined where premises true, then conclusion true. inductive argument where premises provide some evidence truth conclusion. Inductive arguments valid invalid- however, talk about whether they better worse than other arguments, about probable their premises are. There forms argument ordinary language which neither deductive inductive. However, will concentrate moment deductive arguments, they often viewed most rigorous convincing. important note that fact that deductive argument valid does imply that conclusion holds. This because slightly counter-intuitive nature implication, which must consider more carefully. Obviously valid argument consist true propositions. However, argument entirely valid even contains only false propositions. example: insects have wings (premise) Woodlice insects (premise) Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion) Here, conclusion true because argument\'s premises false. argument\'s premises were true, however, conclusion would true. argument thus entirely valid. More subtly, reach true conclusion from more false premises, fish live (premise) Dolphins fish (premise) Therefore dolphins live (conclusion) However, thing cannot reach false conclusion through valid inference from true premises. therefore draw truth table implication. symbol denotes implication- premise, conclusion. represent true false respectively. Premise Conclusion Inference A=>B ---------------------------- premises false inference valid, conclusion true false. premises true conclusion false, inference must invalid. premises true inference valid, conclusion must true. sound argument valid argument whose premises true. sound argument therefore arrives true conclusion. careful confuse valid arguments with sound arguments. delve further into structure logical arguments would require lengthy discussion linguistics philosophy. simpler probably more useful summarize major pitfalls avoided when constructing argument. These pitfalls known fallacies. everyday English term fallacy used refer mistaken beliefs well faulty reasoning that leads those beliefs. This fair enough, logic term generally used refer form technically incorrect argument, especially argument appears valid convincing. purposes this discussion, define fallacy logical argument which appears correct, which seen incorrect when examined more closely. studying fallacies avoid being misled them. following list fallacies intended exhaustive. ARGUMENTUM BACULUM (APPEAL FORCE) Appeal Force committed when arguer resorts force threat force order push acceptance conclusion. often used politicians, summarized might makes right. force threatened need direct threat from arguer. example: Thus there ample proof truth Bible. those refuse accept that truth will burn Hell. ARGUMENTUM HOMINEM Argumentum hominem literally argument directed man. Abusive variety Argumentum Hominem occurs when, instead trying disprove truth assertion, arguer attacks person people making assertion. This invalid because truth assertion does depend upon goodness those asserting example: Atheism evil philosophy. practised Communists murderers. Sometimes court doubt cast upon testimony witness showing, example, that known perjurer. This valid reducing credibility testimony given witness, argumentum hominem- however, does demonstrate that witness\'s testimony false. conclude otherwise fall victim Argumentum Ignorantiam (see elsewhere this list). circumstantial form Argumentum Hominem committed when person argues that opponent ought accept truth assertion because opponent\'s particular circumstances. example: perfectly acceptable kill animals food. argue otherwise when you\'re quite happy wear leather shoes? This abusive charge inconsistency, used excuse dismissing opponent\'s argument. This fallacy also used means rejecting conclusion. example: course would argue that positive discrimination thing. You\'re white. This particular form Argumentum Hominem, when alleges that one\'s adversary rationalizing conclusion formed from selfish interests, also known poisoning well. ARGUMENTUM IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ignorantium means argument from ignorance. This fallacy occurs whenever argued that something must true simply because been proved false. equivalently, when argued that something must false because been proved true. (Note that this same assuming that something false until been proved true, basic scientific principle.) Examples: course Bible true. Nobody prove otherwise. course telepathy other psychic phenomena exist. Nobody shown proof that they real. Note that this fallacy does apply court law, where generally assumed innocent until proven guilty. Also, scientific investigation known that event would produce certain evidence having occurred, absence such evidence validly used infer that event occur. example: flood described Bible would require enormous volume water present earth. earth does have tenth much water, even count that which frozen into poles. Therefore such flood occurred. science, validly assume from lack evidence that something occurred. cannot conclude with certainty that occurred, however. ARGUMENTUM MISERICORDIAM This Appeal Pity, also known Special Pleading. fallacy committed when arguer appeals pity sake getting conclusion accepted. example: murder mother father with axe. Please don\'t find guilty- I\'m suffering enough through being orphan. ARGUMENTUM POPULUM This known Appealing Gallery, Appealing People. commit this fallacy attempt acceptance assertion appealing large group people. This form fallacy often characterized emotive language. example: Pornography must banned. violence against women. Bible must true. Millions people know that trying tell them that they mistaken fools? ARGUMENTUM NUMERAM This fallacy closely related argumentum populum. consists asserting that more people support believe proposition, more likely that that proposition correct. ARGUMENTUM VERECUNDIAM Appeal Authority uses admiration famous support assertion. example: Isaac Newton genius believed God. This line argument always completely bogus- example, reference admitted authority particular field relevant discussion that subject. example, distinguish quite clearly between: Stephen Hawking concluded that black holes give radiation John Searle concluded that impossible build intelligent computer Hawking physicist, reasonably expect opinions black hole radiation informed. Searle linguist, questionable whether well-qualified speak subject machine intelligence. FALLACY ACCIDENT Fallacy Accident committed when general rule applied particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that rule inapplicable. error made when goes from general specific. example: Christians generally dislike atheists. Christian, must dislike atheists. This fallacy often committed moralists legalists decide every moral legal question mechanically applying general rules. CONVERSE ACCIDENT HASTY GENERALIZATION This fallacy reverse fallacy accident. occurs when forms general rule examining only specific cases which representative possible cases. example: Bakker insincere Christian. Therefore Christians insincere. SWEEPING GENERALIZATION DICTO SIMPLICITER sweeping generalization occurs when general rule applied particular situation which features that particular situation render rule inapplicable. sweeping generalization opposite hasty generalization. CAUSA CAUSA POST ERGO PROPTER These known False Cause fallacies. fallacy Causa Causa occurs when identifies something cause event actually been shown cause. example: took aspirin prayed God, headache disappeared. cured headache. fallacy Post Ergo Propter occurs when something assumed cause event merely because happened before event. example: Soviet Union collapsed after taking atheism. Therefore must avoid atheism same reasons. ERGO PROPTER This fallacy similar post ergo propter hoc. asserts that because events occur together, they must causally related, leaves room other factors that cause(s) events. PETITIO PRINCIPII This fallacy occurs when premises least questionable conclusion reached. CIRCULUS DEMONSTRANDO This fallacy occurs when assumes premise conclusion which wishes reach. Often, proposition will rephrased that fallacy appears valid argument. example: Homosexuals must allowed hold government office. Hence government official revealed homosexual will lose job. Therefore homosexuals will anything hide their secret, will open blackmail. Therefore homosexuals cannot allowed hold government office. Note that argument entirely circular- premise same conclusion. argument like above actually been cited reason British Secret Services\' official homosexual employees. Another example classic: know that exists because Bible tells know that Bible true because word God. COMPLEX QUESTION FALLACY INTERROGATION This Fallacy Presupposition. example classic loaded question: Have stopped beating your wife? question presupposes definite answer another question which even been asked. This trick often used lawyers cross-examination, when they questions like: Where hide money stole? Similarly, politicians often loaded questions such long will this interference affairs allowed continue? Does Chancellor plan more years ruinous privatization? IGNORATIO ELENCHI fallacy Irrelevant Conclusion consists claiming that argument supports particular conclusion when actually logically nothing with that conclusion. example, Christian begin saying that will argue that teachings Christianity undoubtably true. then argues length that Christianity great help many people, matter well argues will have shown that Christian teachings true. Sadly, such fallacious arguments often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others view supposed conclusion more favourable light. EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occurs when word used with more different meanings same argument. example: What could more affordable than free software? make sure that remains free, that users what they like with must place license make sure that will always freely redistributable. AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occurs when premises used argument ambiguous because careless ungrammatical phrasing. ACCENT Accent another form fallacy through shifting meaning. this case, meaning changed altering which parts statement emphasized. example, consider: should speak friends should speak FRIENDS FALLACIES COMPOSITION fallacy composition conclude that property shared parts something must apply whole. example: bicycle made entirely mass components, therefore very lightweight. other fallacy composition conclude that property number individual items shared collection those items. example: uses less petrol causes less pollution than bus. Therefore cars less environmentally damaging than buses. FALLACY DIVISION fallacy division opposite fallacy composition. Like opposite, exists varieties. first assume that property some thing must apply parts. example: studying rich college. Therefore must rich. other assume that property collection items shared each item. example: Ants destroy tree. Therefore this destroy tree. SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT This argument states that should event occur, will other harmful events. There proof made that harmful events caused first event. example: legalize marijuana, then would have legalize crack heroin we\'ll have nation full drug-addicts welfare. Therefore cannot legalize marijuana. BASED FALLACIES TYPE FALLACIES These fallacies occur when attempts argue that things some similar without actually specifying what they similar. Examples: Isn\'t history based upon faith? then isn\'t Bible also form history? Islam based faith, Christianity based faith, isn\'t Islam form Christianity? Cats form animal based carbon chemistry, dogs form animal based carbon chemistry, aren\'t dogs form cat? AFFIRMATION CONSEQUENT This fallacy argument form implies true, therefore true. understand fallacy, examine truth table implication given earlier. DENIAL ANTECEDENT This fallacy argument form implies false, therefore false. Again, truth table implication makes clear this fallacy. Note that this fallacy different from Causa Causa- latter form implies false, therefore false, where does fact imply all. Here, problem that implication invalid- rather that falseness does allow deduce anything about CONVERTING CONDITIONAL This fallacy argument form then therefore then ARGUMENTUM ANTIQUITAM This fallacy asserting that something right good simply because old, because that\'s it\'s always been. ARGUMENTUM NOVITAM This opposite argumentum antiquitam- fallacy asserting that something more correct simply because newer than something else. ARGUMENTUM CRUMENAM fallacy believing that money criterion correctness- that those with more money more likely right. ARGUMENTUM LAZARUM fallacy assuming that because someone poor sounder more virtuous than wealthier. This fallacy opposite argumentum crumenam. ARGUMENTUM NAUSEAM This incorrect belief that assertion more likely true more often heard. argumentum nauseum that employs constant repetition asserting something. BIFURCATION Also referred black white fallacy, bifurcation occurs when presents situation having only alternatives, where fact other alternatives exist exist. PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM MANY QUESTIONS This fallacy occurs when questioner demands simple answer complex question. SEQUITUR non-sequitur argument where conclusion drawn from premises which logically connected with HERRING This fallacy committed when irrelevant material introduced issue being discussed, that everyone\'s attention diverted away from points being made, towards different conclusion. REIFICATION HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occurs when abstract concept treated concrete thing. SHIFTING BURDEN PROOF burden proof always person making assertion proposition. Shifting burden proof, special case argumentum ignorantium, fallacy putting burden proof person denies questions assertion being made. source fallacy assumption that something true unless proven otherwise. STRAW straw fallacy misrepresent someone else\'s position that attacked more easily, then knock down that misrepresented position, then conclude that original position been demolished. fallacy because fails deal with actual arguments that have been made. EXTENDED ANALOGY fallacy Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule being argued over. fallacy assume that mentioning different situations, argument about general rule, constitutes claim that those situations analogous each other. This fallacy best explained using real example from debate about anti-cryptography legislation: believe always wrong oppose breaking Such position odious: implies that would have supported Martin Luther King. saying that cryptography legislation important struggle Black liberation? dare you! QUOQUE This famous fallacy. occurs when action argued acceptable because other party performed instance: You\'re just being randomly abusive. You\'ve been abusive too.';0

They\'re great solving problems once method been worked out, working method itself. specific example, like solve numerical crosswords (not simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, hard ones.) these with efficiency, need figure variety tricks. Now, know that program computer these puzzles, doing have work tricks _yourself_, program them into computer. can, course, \'obfuscate\' trick, write program that uncovered, see, trick still there some form discovered.

These models remotely-controlled individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, EduTainment purposes. only does this provide test-bed simple tele-operation tele-presence activities also provides sharing information methods operating space, including, limited layout lunar colony, tele-operating machines work play, disseminating educational information, providing contests awards creativity achievement provides students worldwide participate Twenty-First century remote learning methods. Because nature LTM1 project, people ages, interests skills contribute scenery murals, models structures, interfacing electronics, software graphics. operation LTM1 evolving playground laboratory that used children, students professionals worldwide. Using personal computer home terminal participating institution user able tele-operate real models LTM1 base experimental recreational purposes. Because real facility exists, ample opportunity provided media coverage construction lunar model, operation features added suggested users themselves. This broad inherent interest wide range groups: tele-operations virtual reality research radio control, model railroad radio operation astronomy space planetariums science centers theater online network users software game developers manufacturers retailers model rockets, cars trains children child LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN: room feet feet contains base lunar layout. walls used murals distant moon mountains, star fields view earth. floor simulated lunar surface. global call contributions hereby made material lunar surface, design creation scale models lunar colony elements, scenery, machine-lets. LTM1 initial design tele-operated machinelets: SSTO scale model which will able lift off, hover land- bulldozerlet which will able move about quarry area- moon-train which will traverse most simulated lunar surface. Each machinelet small camera utilizing chip mounted personal computer digitizes image (including reducing picture content doing data-compression allow minimal images sent operator control purposes) also return control signals. first machinelet will moon-train since model trains with cameras built almost off-the-shelf items control electronics starting stopping train minimal. user will receive image once every seconds depending speed their data link LTM1. Next, SSTO scale model with chip will suspended from servo-motor operated wire frame mounted ceiling allowing SSTO controlled operator take off, hover over entire lunar landscape land. Finally, some tank models will modified chip equipped bulldozerlets. entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide receive minimal images while actually operating models landing takeoff, traveling doing work. entire system based commercially available items parts that easily obtained except interface electronics which well within capability many advanced radio operator computer hardware/software developers. taking graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) adding tele-operations screen controls, necessary user interface provided under hours. PLAN ACTION: Diaspar Virtual Reality Network agreed sponsor this project providing host computer network Internet access that network. Diaspar providing foot foot facility actual construction lunar model. Diaspar has, stock, electronic tanks that modified chip. Diaspar also agrees provide rail stock lunar train model. Diaspar will make available Dmodem graphical communications package modify control machines-lets. initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will performed live photo-session news conference April 1993. initial models will place. time-lapse record will started historical purposes. expected that this event will completely serious solemn. lunar colony will declared open additional building, operations experiments. photographer will present photographs taken will converted .gif images distribution world-wide major online networks bbs\'s. press release will issued calling contributions ideas, time, talent, materials scale models simulated lunar colony. contest designs techniques working moon will then announced. Universities will invited participate, goal being find instructors wish have class participation various aspects lunar colony model. Field trips LTM1 arranged that time results class work will added model. Contributors will then able tele-operate contributed machine-lets once they return their campus. monthly LTM1 newsletter will issued both electronically online conventional means media. major tele-operated equipment addition will marked with invitation television news media. Having large, real model space colony will very attractive photo opportunity television community. Especially since action will controlled people over world. Science fiction writers will invited issue challenges engineering human factors students universities build operate tele-operated equipment perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight pulley systems, gravity simulated some extent various traction challenges. long term goal creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation remote operation lunar colony.

This book Volume revised enlarged edition STRUCTURE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE, 1959. Volume NOTHING MOTION (1979), Volume BASIC PROPERTIES MATTER (1988). Most books journal articles subject astrophysics bristling with integrals, partial differentials, other FANCY MATHEMATICS. this book, contrast, mathematics conspicuous absence, except some relatively simple formulas imbedded text. Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS declares that mathematical agreement with theory does guarantee conceptual validity. Dewey Larson retired engineer with Bachelor Science Degree Engineering Science from Oregon State University. developed Theory described books while trying find MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE properties chemical compounds based ONLY elements they contain. UNIVERSE MOTION describes astrophysical portions Larson\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, GENERAL UNIFIED Theory physical universe, kind grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists astro-physicists CLAIM looking for. built postulates about physical mathematical nature space time: physical universe composed ENTIRELY component, MOTION, existing THREE dimensions, DISCRETE units, with RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE TIME. physical universe conforms relations ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, primary magnitudes ABSOLUTE, geometry EUCLIDEAN. From these postulates, Larson able build COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons subatomic particles giant elliptical galaxies, combining concept INWARD OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with translational, vibrational, rotational, rotational- vibrational motions. each step development, able match parts theoretical universe with corresponding parts real physical universe, including EVEN THINGS DISCOVERED. example, 1959 book, first predicted existence EXPLODING GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them. They NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE comprehensive Theory. when quasars were discovered, related explanation ready those also. result theory, which called RECIPROCAL SYSTEM, Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many sacred doctrines orthodox physicists astrophysicists, including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, quantum wave mechanics applied atomic structure), nuclear physics, general relativity, relativistic mass increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion stars, bang, which considered nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES. very critical assumptions, uncertainty principles, solutions principle, other declarations, etc., used maintain them. UNIVERSE MOTION divided into chapters. begins with description galaxies built from gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, which formed from intergalactic dust clouds that accumulate from decay products cosmic rays coming from ANTI-MATTER HALF physical universe. (Galaxy formation from MYTHICAL bang mystery orthodox astronomers.) then goes describe life cycles stars binary multiple star systems solar systems result from Type supernova explosions SINGLE stars. Several chapters devoted quasars which, according Larson, densely-packed clusters stars that have been ejected from central bulges exploding galaxies actually traveling FASTER THAN SPEED LIGHT (although most that speed AWAY FROM TIME). Astronomers astrophysicists against observations that contradict their theories would find Larson\'s explanations quite valuable considered with OPEN MIND. example, they used believe that GAMMA BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily plane central bulge galaxy. gamma telescope earth orbit observed that bursts come from DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY correspond with visible objects, (except cases directional coincidence). Larson\'s explanation that gamma bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS ANTI-MATTER HALF physical universe, which Larson calls cosmic sector. Because anti-matter universe exists RECIPROCAL RELATION material universe, with speed light BOUNDARY between them, THREE dimensions time ONLY dimension space, bursts into material universe ANYWHERE seemingly random. Larson heavily quotes paraphrases statements from books, journal articles, leading physicists astronomers. this book, them superscripted with numbers identifying entries reference list book. example, quote from book Astronomy: Cosmic Journey, William Hartmann, says, hopes understanding stars would brighten could explain exactly binary multiple stars form.... Unfortunately cannot.

Flight tests will start mid-June. Although there wasn\'t cloud noonday sky, forecast SSTO research remains cloudy. Organization which paid million DC-X can\'t itself afford fund full development follow-on vehicle. necessary hundreds millions required sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO passing among sister government agencies. SDIO originally funded SSTO research costs orbital deployments space-based sensors weapns. However, recent changes SDI\'s political marching orders budget cuts have made SSTO less priority. Today, agency more interested using DC-X step towards low-cost, reusable sounding rocket. SDIO already done briefings other government agencies, said Col. Simon Pete Worden, SDIO\'s deputy technology. Worden declined much agencies would have pony program. didn\'t make colonel telling contractors much money have available spend, quipped press conference McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters. While SDIO lowered sights program\'s orbital objective, agency officials hail DC-X example better, faster, cheaper approach hardware development. agency believes this philosophy produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead evolutionary technology developments. Worden said DC-X illustrates build little, test little approach produce results time within budget. said program which went from concept hardware around months showed today\'s engineers could move beyond miracles parents\' time. management, Worden said. SDIO very light hand this project. only overworked major, Jess Sponable. Although next phase involve more agencies, Worden said lean management sense government-industry partnership will crucial. It\'s essential with large management structure where price goes exponentially. SDIO\'s approach also praise from California members House Science, Space Technology Committee. This direction we\'re going have said Rep. George Brown, committee\'s Democratic chairman. Programs that stretch aout years aren\'t sustainable....NASA hasn\'t learned yet. SDIO has. Rep. Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\'s Republican colleague, went further. Joking that shrimp fish designed NASA design team, Rohrbacher doubted that program ever would have been completed were left civil space agency. Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work conventional, multi-staged rockets placing casings around missile technology. Let\'s build fancy ammunition with capsules top. Let\'s build spaceship! Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\'s sponsorship, said private sector needs take lead developing SSTO technology. McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with C-17 transport Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about large private secotro commitment. very large ventures, companies seed money, said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\' senior vice president space systems. need strong government investments. While government industry continue differ funding DC-XA, they agree continuing incremental approach development. Citing corporate history, they liken process Douglas Aircraft\'s aircraft. Just earlier aircraft paved DC-3 transport, gradual evolution single-stage rocketry could eventually lead orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1). Flight tests this summer White Sands will expand envelope performance, with successive tests increasing speed altitude. first tests will reach feet demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off landing. second series will send unmanned DC-X 5,000 feet. third final series will take craft 20,000 feet. Maneuvers will become more complex third phase. final tests will include pitch-over manever that rotates vehicle back into bottom-down configuration soft, four-legged landing. flight test series will supervised Charles Pete Conrad, performed similar maneuvers Apollo moon landing. McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised vehicles aircraft-like approach operations. Features include automated check-out access panels easy maintainance. program moves next stage, engine technology will become consideration. This engine would have more thrust than Pratt Whitney RL10A-5 engines used DC-X. Each motor uses liquid hydrogen liquid oxygen propellants generate 14,760 pounds thrust Based engine used Centaur upper stages, model thrust champer designed level operation three-to-on throttling capability. also designed repeat firings rapid turnaround.

Some values, such Golden Rule, have rational basis. Some others, like basic idea wanting live, probably roots brains wired. Lewis ignored very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour, morality well. Indeed, humans evolved better better building using tools, they also became better killing each other. logical necessity that evolution could only favour those knew tools, against one\'s people.

Features: Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets. limit number users (apart from performance). Generic clients. Customizable servers. Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment cameras light sources). Multiple light sources (ambient, point spot). Objects have extension code, handle unique functionality, easily attached. Functionality: Client: client built around \'fast\' render loop. Basically changes things when told server then renders image from user\'s viewpoint. also provides server with information about user\'s actions which then communicated other clients therefore other users. client designed generic other words don\'t need develop client when want enter world. This means that resources spent enhancing client software rather than adapting adaptations, will explained moment, occur servers. This release client software supports following functionality: Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing) Multiple Light Sources Types (Ambient, Point Spot) User Interface Panels Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe \tfaster frame rates) Mouse Keyboard Input (Some people disappointed that this software doesn\'t support PowerGlove input device this because can\'t, because don\'t have one! This will, however, first enhancements!) Server(s): This where customization take place. following basic support provided this release potential world server developers: Transparent Client Management Client Message Handling This sound like much, takes away headache accepting terminating clients receiving messages from them application writer work with assumption that things happening locally. Things more interesting object extension functionality. This what provided allow animate your objects: Server Selectable Extension Installation: What this means that decide which objects have extended functionality your world. Basically call extension initialisers want. Event Handler Registration: When develop extensions object basically write callback functions events that want object respond (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE TERMINATE) Collision Detection Registration: want your object respond collision events just provide some basic information collision detection management software. Your callback will activated when collision occurs. This software kept separate from worldServer applications because application developer wants build library extended objects from which choose. following need make World Server application: Provide initWorld function: This where choose what object extensions will supported, plus initialization want Provide positionObject function: This where determine where place client. Provide installWorldObjects function: This where load world (.wld) file client. Provide getWorldType function: This where tell client what persona they should have. Provide animateWorld function: This where wild! minimum should objects move calling move function) server sleep avoid outrunning clients). That\'s there prove here line counts three world servers I\'ve provided: generic lines dactyl lines (more complicated collision detection stairs! Will probably improved with future versions) dogfight lines Location: This software located following site: ftp.u.washington.edu Directory: pub/virtual-worlds File: multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z Futures: Client: Texture mapping.

SOVIETS VENUS PART Copyright 1993 Larry Klaes \tThe author gives permission group individual wishing \tto distribute this article, long proper credit given, author notified, article reproduced entirety. North Pole! June 1983, Soviet Union\'s mighty PROTON rockets lifted from Tyuratam Space Center Kazakhstan Republic. Aboard those boosters were breed VENERA probe planet Venus. Designated VENERA probes were meant landing more spherical craft Venerean surface radar planet detail from orbit. accomplish this task, basic VENERA design modified numerous areas. central core made meter (39.37 inches) longer carry tons propellant required braking into orbit, double fuel carried VENERA orbiters eight years earlier. Extra solar panels were added give vehicles more power handling large amounts data which would created radar imaging. dish-shaped communications antennae were also made meter larger properly transmit this information Earth. Atop buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed 6-meter (4.62 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound) POLYUS side-looking radar antennae. radar system, possibly terrain-imaging version nuclear-powered satellites used Soviets Earth ocean surveillance, would able Venus\' surface resolution kilometers (0.62 miles). Soviet probes\' imaging parameters were vast improvement over United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects smaller than kilometers miles) diameter. while VENERAs\' resolution comparable that similar observations made 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope island Puerto Rico, orbiters would examining northern pole Venus. This region unobtainable either Arecibo PIONEER VENUS appeared contain number potentially interesting geological features worthy investigation. October 1983, after interplanetary journey million kilometers (198 million miles) mid-course corrections, VENERA fired braking rockets over Venus place itself polar orbit 1,000 65,000 kilometers (600 39,000 miles) around planet, completing revolution every twenty-four hours. VENERA followed suit four days later. twin probes thus became Venus\' first polar-circling spacecraft. Radar operations began October VENERA October VENERA sixteen minutes every orbit over north pole, probes would make radar sweep surface kilometers (ninety miles) wide nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long. craft would then head highest part their orbits over south pole recharge their batteries transmit data back large Soviet antennae Earth. Each strip information took eight hours process computer. their main missions July 1984, VENERAs mapped million square kilometers million square miles), thirty percent entire planet. VENERA revealed that Venus surface geology more complex than shown PIONEER VENUS late 1970s. Numerous hills, mountains, ridges, valleys, plains spread across landscape, many them apparently formed lava from erupting volcanoes last billion years. planetary terms this makes Venerean surface rather young. Hundreds craters were detected well, largest which have been created meteorites (planetoids would better term here) least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) across, Venus\' very dense atmosphere. There were some disagreements between U.S. Soviet scientists origins certain surface features. example, probes\' owners declared that 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater summit 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, tallest mountain planet, result meteorite impact. American scientists, other hand, felt crater proof that Maxwell huge volcano sitting northern continent Ishtar Terra. event, U.S. decided wait making verdicts about Venus until arrival their radar probe, scheduled later decade. Originally named Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar (VOIR), initial design scaled back craft redesig- nated Venus Radar Mapper (VRM). Eventually machine would called MAGELLAN, after Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan (circa 1480-1521). This vehicle would entire planet even finer detail than VENERAs. time, however, Soviet probes maintained that distinction. Radar imaging only ability VENERAs. Bolted next POLYUS radar antenna were Omega altimeter Fourier infrared spectrometer, latter measuring world\'s temperatures. majority areas covered registered about five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), locations were hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating current volcanic activity. probes also found that clouds over poles were five eight kilometers (three miles) lower than equator. contrast, polar above sixty kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude five twenty degrees warmer than equatorial atmosphere similar heights. When main mapping mission ended July 1984, there were plans least VENERAs radar image surface more southernly latitudes. Unfortunately this idea come pass, orbiters have possessed enough attitude-control perform operation. VENERA ceased transmission March 1985, leaving Soviet Institute Radiotechnology Electronics with hundred kilometers (360 miles) radar data tape sort into atlas twenty-seven maps northern hemisphere Venus. Venus Balloon years thick atmosphere Venus been tempting target scientists wished explore planet\'s mantle with balloon-borne instruments. Professor Jacques Blamont French space agency Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) proposed such idea back 1967, only have joint French-Soviet balloon mission canceled 1982. Nevertheless, late year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true. When PROTON rockets were sent skyward December Soviet Union provided Western observers with first clear, full views booster which been launching every Soviet Venus probe since 1975. This many firsts complex mission. unmanned probes launched into space that December were named VEGA contraction words VENERA GALLEI Gallei being Russian word Halley. only spacecraft have more than mission perform, they also more than celestial objective explore, namely comet Halley. This famous periodic traveler making latest return inner regions solar system since last visit 1910. Since widely believed that comets remains from formation solar system five billion years ago, scientists around world gave high priority exploring such bodies which actually come close Earth. Most comets linger cold dark outer fringes solar system. Some, like Halley, perturbed various forces fall towards Sun, where they circle millennia spewing debris millions kilometers from warmth each solar encounter. Soviet Union, along with European Space Agency (ESA) Japan\'s Institute Space Astronautical Science (ISAS), wish miss this first opportunity human history make close examination Halley. would using cylindrical GIOTTO probe make dangerously close photographic flyby comet, while Japan\'s first deep space craft SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) SUISEI (Comet) would view Halley from much safer distance. Scientists United States also desired study comet from vantage space probe, time envisioning vessel powered solar sails engines. However, government budget cuts NASA canceled American efforts. U.S. would have make primarily with Earth-based observations sharing data from other nations, though instrument named Dust Counter Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed Chicago University Professor John Simpson, added Soviet mission 1984. Soviets\' answer Halley were VEGAs. Instead building entirely craft mission, Soviets decided modify their VENERA design encounter comet while performing advanced Venus mission along way. VEGA reached Venus, buses would drop lander/balloon each mass shrouded planet swing them towards comet Halley, much U.S. probe MARINER used Venus flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. Soviet craft would then head Halley, helping pinpoint location comet\'s erupting nucleus GIOTTO probe dive only kilometers (363 miles) away March 1986. planned, VEGAs arrived Venus June 1985. VEGA released payload first ninth month, lander making two-day descent towards planet. craft touched upper atmosphere morning June Sixty-one kilometers (36.6 miles) above Venerean surface small container released lander, which produced parachute kilometers miles) altitude. Thus first balloon probe ever explore Venus successfully arrived. kilometer after opening parachute, helium pumped into Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating diameter 3.54 meters (11.68 feet). Dangling tether thirteen meters (42.9 feet) below instrument package, properly known aerostat. part 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat consisted cone which served antenna tether attachment point balloon. Beneath transmitter, electronics, instruments. Connected bottom nephelometer measuring cloud particles. aerostat painted with special white finish keep corroding mist sulfuric acid which permeated planet\'s atmosphere. VEGA balloon dropped into night side Venus just north equator. Scientists were concerned that would burst heat daylight, they placed darkened hemisphere give craft much time possible return data. This action necessitated that landers come down dark well, effectively removing camera systems used previous missions. author wonders, though, they could have used floodlights similar ones attached VENERA 1975, when Soviet scientists thought planet\'s surface enshrouded perpetual twilight permanently thick cloud cover. first balloon transmitted 46.5 hours right into hemisphere before lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600 kilometers (6,960 miles). threat bursting heat materialize. VEGA balloon stationed 54-kilometer (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast fifty kilometers (thirty miles), this considered most active three main cloud layers reported PIONEER VENUS 1978. Indeed balloon pushed across planet speeds kilometers (150 miles) hour. Strong vertical winds bobbed craft down three hundred meters (660 feet) through most journey. layer\'s temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) pressure mere Earth atmosphere. nephelometer could find clear regions surrounding clouds. Early first balloon\'s flight, VEGA lander already headed towards Venerean surface. Both landers were equipped with soil drill analyzer similar ones carried VENERA 1982. However, VEGA would become unable report composition ground landing site Rusalka Planitia, Mermaid Plain north Aphrodite Terra. While still fifteen minutes away from landing, timer malfunction caused drill accidentally begin programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 miles) above surface. There neither shut instrument before touchdown reactivate after landing. This unfortunate only general loss data also fact that most Venus covered with such smooth low-level lava plains never before been directly examined. Nevertheless, surface temperature pressure calculated degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees Fahrenheit) Earth atmospheres respectively during lander\'s minutes ground transmissions. large amount background infrared radiation also recorded site. been done when drills cameras VENERA failed December 1978, Soviets focused data returned during lander\'s plunge through atmosphere. French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, possibly phosphorus. sulfur possibly from active volcanoes which gives Venerean clouds their yellowish color. Sigma chromatograph found that every cubic meter between altitude kilometers (28.8 37.8 miles) contained milligram (0.015 grain) sulfuric acid. VEGA data overall structure cloud decks appeared odds with information from PIONEER VENUS. case made even stronger fact that VEGA 2\'s results nearly matched twin. VEGAs found only main cloud layers instead three reported U.S. probes. layers were three five kilometers (1.8 miles) thick altitudes kilometers 34.8 miles). clouds persisted like thin until clearing altitude kilometers miles), much lower than readings. possibility discrepan- cies have been radical structural changes Venerean over last seven years. When lander balloon finally went silent, last functioning part VEGA mission, flyby bus, sailed million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around become first probe meet comet Halley. March 1986, made 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass dark visitor before traveling interplanetary space. Soviets accomplished their first mission celestial bodies with space vessel. June VEGA released lander/balloon payload two-day fall towards Venus. Like duplicate, VEGA balloon radioed information back twenty antennae tracking Earth 46.5 hours before battery failure morning side planet. During 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile) flight over Venus, second balloon entered rather still environment which became less twenty hours into mission. After hours mission time became even more turbulent further eight hours. When balloon passed over five- kilometer (three-mile) mountain continent Aphrodite Terra, powerful downdraft pulled craft kilometers (1.5 miles) towards surface. Temperature sensors VEGA balloon reported that layer moving through consistently degrees Celsius (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than area explored VEGA balloon. This corroborated VEGA lander passed through balloon\'s level. positive indications lightning were made either balloon, second aerostat\'s nephelometer failed function. VEGA lander touched down northern edge Aphrodite Terra\'s western fifteenth June, 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) southeast VEGA lander\'s resting place smoother than thought, indicating either very ancient worn surface relatively young covered fresh lava. soil drill working order reported rock type known anorthosite-troctolite, rare Earth present Luna\'s highlands. This rock rich aluminum silicon lacking iron magnesium. high degree sulfur also present soil. around VEGA measured degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) Earth atmospheres, essentially typical night) Venus. above VEGA lander, carrier sped past Venus distance 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) followed twin comet Halley, making closer flyby March 1986 just 8,030 kilometers (4,818 miles). Both probes helped reveal that comet very dark irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every hours, give take three hours. Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley encounters, Soviet scientists considered option send probes other celestial objects. prime target near- Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA could pass distance million kilometers (3.6 million miles). Sadly, Soviets back opportunity become first nation spacecraft past planetoid when discovered that there enough maneuvering fuel probe reach Adonis planned. VEGA were quietly shut down early 1987. Future Plans Diverted impressive VEGA mission given some scientists numerous ideas hope even more ambitious expeditions second world from Sun. example VESTA mission, planned early 1990s. This Soviet-French collaboration called launch multiple probes single PROTON rocket either 1991 1992. craft would first swing Venus drop several landers balloon probes. aerostats would designed survive planet\'s corrosive atmosphere month, large improvement over VEGA balloons\' days. mission would then head investigate several planetoids comets, including possible landing Vesta (thus mission name), most reflective Main Belt planetoid seen from Earth. Unfortunately Venus exploration, plans began change Soviet Union. 1986 Soviets decided reroute VESTA mission planet Mars instead Venus, keeping comet planetoid aspects intact. this time Soviet space program interest focusing Mars. Already under construction entirely probe design called PHOBOS. members this class were planned leave Earth 1988 orbit Mars next year. PHOBOS would then place first instruments Mars\' largest moon, Phobos. this prelude even more advanced Mars expeditions, including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, eventually human explorers early Twenty-First Century. environment Venus just hostile serious consideration human colonization near future. things began look bleak Soviet Venus Mars exploration. Both PHOBOS probes failed complete their missions, losing contact Planet 1988 other going silent Mars orbit just week before planned moon landing March 1989. 1989 plan devised Venus orbiter drop eight penetrators around planet 1998. Several years later mission launch date moved year 2005 been indefinite hold. other official Soviet missions Venus have since been forth, commentary after twenty-five years continuous robotic exploration planet. During late 1980s drastic political economic change taking over Soviet Union. President Mikhail Gorbachev began open nation benefits increased cooperation with rest nations, particularly those West. While culture became less oppressive than past, economy taking very rough ride also underwent effects free market. These effects everywhere, including space program. Missions levels were back. Soviets began making almost desperate attempts cooperate with other space-faring nations either keep their remaining programs alive just make money. early 1992 reported that Soviets were offering sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they storage price million dollars each, incredibly price planetary probe. nation took them bargain. Meanwhile United States gearing Venus missions their own. MAGELLAN GALILEO U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration with launch Space Shuttle ATLANTIS 1989. Aboard Shuttle MAGELLAN spacecraft, combination spare parts from other U.S. probes designed make most detailed complete radar-mapping Venus history. When MAGELLAN reached second world August 1990, would able almost entire planet down resolution meters (360 feet), surpassing abilities VENERA interim another American probe launched from Space Shuttle which would make quick flyby Venus orbit giant planet Jupiter 1995. October 1989, Shuttle ATLANTIS released second unmanned planetary probe into space, named GALILEO after famous Italian astronomer discovered probe\'s primary target\'s major moons 1610. absence powerful enough booster send GALILEO direct flight Jovian planet, probe sent around Venus Earth several times build enough speed reach Jupiter. result, Venus became GALILEO\'s first planetary goal February 1990. probe radioed back images planet\'s swirling clouds further indications lightning that violent atmosphere. Drawing Boards With incredible success MAGELLAN last years, plans have been laid further journeys Venus. Scien- tists U.S. have talked space scientists former Soviet Union Commonwealth Independent States since January 1992 cooperative effort launch VENERA lander missions within next decade. Japan, India, have also considered their Venus missions next decades. February 1993 NASA came with several Venus projects part their Discovery Program launching inexpensive probes throughout solar system. Venus missions were selected further study: Venus Multiprobe Mission involving landing fourteen small probes over hemisphere measure winds, temperature, pressure- Venus Composition Probe, designed study Venus\' atmosphere while descending through thick with parachute, much Soviets done since 1967. Final project decisions will made 1994. Humans Venus Will human ever able stand surface Venus? present lead-melting temperatures crushing pressure would threatening Earth life protected something even tougher than VENERA lander. Plans have been looked into changing environment Venus itself into something more like Earth\'s. However, should noted that such undertaking will require removal much thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, major reduction surface heat, ability speed planet\'s rotation rate something faster than once every Earth days. Such project take centuries millennia. meantime efforts should made better understand Venus exists today. still have fully know world seemingly similar Earth many important ways became instead such deadly place. Will Earth ever suffer this fate? Perhaps Venus holds answers. Such answers best found through international cooperation, including nation which made first attempts lift cloudy veils from Venus.

24;'This discussion objective seems falling into solipsism (Eg: recent challenge from Frank Dwyer, someone prove that actually observe phenomena).

Lets start remembering definition objective which been already presented: objective ADJ. having with material object distinguished from mental concept. Having actual existence. 3.a. Unenfluenced emotion personal prejudice. Based observable phenomenon. Objectivity thing based whether everyone agrees that thing (eg: world objectively round, regardless fact that there exist flat earthers), rather whether based observable verifiable phenomenon (instead being based solely peoples wishes, feeling, mental processes, etc). Thus atoms, being based very observable repeatable phenomenon, indeed considered objective rather than subjective. Even weird, high energy physics based observable phenomenon (even though that observation change outcome). those observable phenomenon affected emotion, personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions change whims different people). Thus that science objective (ie: objectively verifiable) silly, that point science. will agree that science objectively good- will thereby conclude though that science objective. some examples things which objective: D-12 tractor larger than average breadbox. Chlorophyll green. Seawater contains salt. There exists ozone atmosphere least presently). Ozone blocks ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light increases incidents skin Cancer. Good other hand value judgement. doesn\'t seem have existence apart from what give (unless someone objectively show existence omnipotent entity which defined good). cannot quantify touch collect concrete sense (eg: have full good). sometimes attempt give word good objective meaning, e.g. good been used denote strength, resiliency, speed, etc. That though, subjective definition, some might strength etc, necessarily good (eg: strength inspired Naziism generally viewed good). morality, cannot that have ever seen morality strictly based verifiable observable phenomenon. closest have seen some form Golden Rule, which concludes that best deliberately piss people off, they will likely then involve themselves your life, manner won\'t like. This verifiable- when someone\'s face, they will often retaliate. Another objective fact about morality that more powerful group enforce their morality weaker group, thus times, ignore that form Golden Rule without fear reprisal. whether this enforcing morality good bad, quite subjective. way, remember that subjective does mean that thing cannot formally stated, even commonly agreed upon- only means that that verifiable from observable phenomena, physical existence unto itself. Also note that have stated that there such thing objective morality, that could accept such morality- have simply stated that have seen evidence such morality. other thing notice, objective many times used synonymous with true and/or absolute, subjective sometimes connotation false and/or relative. Tain\'t necessarily instance, when conclusion based objective, insufficient evidence, then both objective false. absolute, easy note that while objectively show that explosive, that does absolutely mean that will explode, thus objective necessarily absolute either. other hand, something subjective also either absolutist, true. instance, there some theists specifically absolutist their morality, even though they have only subjective evidence back Further, many scientist detective been motivated subjective reasons (eg: feeling hunch), investigate phenomena situation, gather objective evidence necessary support true hypothesis. whole though, would have agree that objective evidence much more trustworthy than subjective evidence. \t\t\t\tLater, \t\t\t\tDave Butler';3

235;think passage you\'re looking following. Matthew 5:17 Think that have come abolish prophets- have come abolish them fulfil them. Matthew 5:18 truly, you, till heaven earth pass away, iota, dot, will pass from until accomplished. Matthew 5:19 Whoever then relaxes least these commandments teaches shall called least kingdom heaven- does them teaches them shall called great kingdom heaven. Matthew 5:20 tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that scribes Pharisees, will never enter kingdom heaven. There several problems with this. most serious that regarded Jews time (and now) binding Jews, Gentiles. There rules that were binding human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), they quite minimal. issue that Church face after Jesus\' death what about Gentiles wanted follow Christ. decision impose them didn\'t that abolished. simply acknowledged that fact that didn\'t apply Gentiles. This simple answer, which think just about everyone agree discussion issue more less these terms recorded Acts 15.) However there\'s more involved. order full picture role Law, have come grips with Paul\'s apparent rejection Law, that relates Jesus\' commendation Law. least read Paul, says that serves purpose that been certain sense superceded. Again, this issue isn\'t abolition Law. middle discussion, Paul notes that might understood this way, assures that that\'s what intends say. Rather, sees primarily being present convict people their sinfulness. ultimately it\'s impossible standard, that been superceded Christ. Paul\'s comments world\'s clearest here, everyone agrees with reading. interesting thing notice that even this radical position does entail abolition Law. still remains uncompromising standard, from which iota removed. purpose convicting sin, it\'s important that relaxed. However Christians, it\'s ultimately live faith, Law. While theoretical categories they rather different, think Jesus Paul come rather similar conclusion. quoted passage from should taken context rest Sermon Mount, where Jesus shows interprets Law. iota would suggest rather literal reading, fact that\'s Jesus\' approach. Jesus\' interpretations emphasize intent Law, stay away from ceremonial details. Indeed well known taking rather free attitude towards Sabbath kosher laws. Some scholars claim that 5:17-20 needs taken context Cent. Jewish discussions. Jesus accuses opponents caring about giving tenth even most minor herbs, neglecting things that really matter: justice, mercy faith, caring about cups plates cleaned, about fact that inside people them full extortion rapacity. (Mat 23:23-25) This, discussion later suggest that Jesus very specific view mind, that when talks about maintaining full strength, thinking these aspects Paul\'s conclusion similar. While talks about being superceded, specific examples gives involve ceremonial law, such circumcision Sabbath. quite concerned about maintaining moral standards. result this that when Paul talks about being superceded, Jesus talks about being maintained, believe they talking about different aspects Law. Paul embroiled arguments about circumcision. natural letters responding specific situations, he\'s looking aspect that currently causing trouble: specifically Jewish ceremonies. certainly does intend abolish divine standards conduct. other hand, when Jesus commends Law, seems talking broadest implications morals human relationships, deemphasizing those aspects that were later give Paul much trouble.';3

I\'ll typein handout gave meeting. Here goes \t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail \t\t\t------------------------- Introduction solar sail well-established concept. Harnessing pressure sunlight, spacecraft would have unlimited range. principle, such vehicle could explore whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption. However more difficult design practical solar sail than most people realize. pressure sunlight only about kilogram square kilometer. Deploying controlling large area aluminized fabric which would necessary transport \'conventional\' type spacecraft daunting task. This why, despite potential idea, such craft actually been launched date. 2.Design Recent advances microelectronics make possible different concept: tiny sail just metres diameter which could controlled purely electronics, with mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods feasible: example pressure sunlight exerts panel solar cells varies according whether power being drawn. components craft will minute camera developed Edinburgh University which both attitude sensor data gathering device- solar cells providing watt power control communication- directional radio antenna etched onto surface sail itself. Launched piggyback payload, total cost mission limited tens thousands dollars. 3.Missions craft would capable some ambitious missions. example: could rendezvous with nearby asteroid from Apollo Amor groups. Closeup pictures could transmitted back Earth rate. could steered into lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around lunar poles could viewed. angling sail reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such water have become trapped these locations.[Immensely valuable information setting manned lunar base, BTW] could sent rendezvous with small asteroid comet nucleus. Impacting speed, thin wire probe attached craft causes rebound while capturing tiny sample sharp-edged tube, like performing biopsy. Returning Earth, sail acts ideal re-entry parachute: load unit area gm/m2 ensures that heat reradiated efectively that sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 material sample recovered, enclosed small insulating container.
