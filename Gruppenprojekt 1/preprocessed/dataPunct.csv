3;I have a request for those who would like to see Charley Wingate respond to the Charley Challenges and judge from my e mail there appear to be quite a few of you it be clear that Mr. Wingate intend to continue to post tangential or unrelated article while ingore the Challenges themselves between the last two re posting of the Challenges I note perhaps a dozen or more post by Mr. Wingate none of which answer a single challenge it seem unmistakable to I that Mr. Wingate hope that the question will just go away and he be do his level well to change the subject give that this seem a rather common net.theist tactic I would like to suggest that we impress upon he our desire for answer in the follow manner 1 ignore any future article by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges until he answer they or explictly announce that he refuse to do so --or-- 2 if you must respond to one of his article include within it something similar to the follow please answer the question pose to you in the Charley Challenges really I 'm not look to humiliate anyone here I just want some honest answer you would n't think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout Christian would you nevermind that be a rhetorical question;0

16;Size of army duration number of casualty both absolute and as a percentage of those involve geographical area and number of country too be all measure of size in this case I 'd say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatant total troop compare to total casualty from among the total civilian population in the affect geographical area Vietnam and Korea might make good comparison western news in general but in particular the american mass medium CBS NBC ABC etc the general tone of the news during the whole war be one of those poor poor Iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blow this building to bit I agree perhaps so and maybe the atomic bomb be a mistake too but that be easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the 90 's right back then it be   all out   war and Germany and Japan have to be squash after all a million or more british have already die hundred of thousand of French a couple hundread thousand or so Americans and million of Russians not to mention a few million Jews Poles and other people of slavic descent in german concentration camp all thing consider the fire bombing and the atomic bomb be essential and therefore justify in bring the war to a quick end to avoid even great allied loss I for one do n't regret it sure and it 's the people who suffer because of they all the more reason to depose these entrenched political ruler operate in their own selfish interest or do you mean that this apply to the ally as well I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war it be evident that the West especially America misjudge Hussein drastically but once Hussein invade Kuwait and threaten to militarily corner a significant portion of the world 's oil supply he have to be stop sure the war could have be prevent by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invade Kuwait but it be still   Hussein   who be responsible for his decision to invade and once he do so a strong response from the West be require well it be not very loving to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up nearby country and keep they or to allow they to continue with mass slaughter of certain people under their dominion so I 'd have to say yes stop Hussein be the most love thing to do for the most people involve once he set his mind on military conquest I mention it if we had n't intervene allow Hussein to keep Kuwait then it would have be appeasement it be precisely the lesson the world learn in WW2 that motivate the western alliance to war let Hitler take Austria and Czechoslavkia do not stop WW2 from happen and let Hussein keep Kuwait would not have stop an eventual Gulf War to protect Saudi Arabia sure what be truly unfortunate be that they follow Hitler in his grandiose quest for a Thousand Year Reich the consequence stem from that what should I say about they anything in particular so it be the   policeman   on trial not Rodney King and under american law they deserve a jury of   their   peer if there have be black officer involve I 'm sure their would have be black juror too this point of allegedly racial motivation be really shallow so It 's hard to imagine so when have Argument from Incredulity gain acceptance from the revered author of construct a Logical Argument can we expect another revision soon just kid I have to admit that I wonder this too but   neither   the prosecution nor the defense be talk so one can not conclude either way due to the silence of the principal ok it certainly seem to I that there be excessive force involve and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffle I too but then I learn that the prosecution in the first case do not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have win they try to get a conviction on a charge of aggravate assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm a charge which news commentator say be akin to attempt murder under California law base on what the prosecution be ask for it 's evident that the first jury decide that the officer be not guilty note not not guilty of do wrong but not guilty of aggravate assault with the   intent   of inflict serious bodily harm the seed of the prosecution defeat be in their own overconfidence in obtain a verdict such that they go for the most extreme charge they could if the fact as the news commentator present they be true then I feel the not guilty verdict be a reasonable one thank mathew I like the quote pretty funny actually I 'm a Monty Python fan you know kind of seem in that vein of course oversimplify any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already regard;0

23;there have be a lot of discussion about Tyre in sum Ezekiel prophesy that the place would be mash and never rebuilt- as there be a lot of people live there it would appear that Ezekiel be not literally correct this does n't bother I at all because I understand the language Ezekiel use differently than do so call biblical literalist for example it sometimes happen that someone say my grandson be the cut baby and then turn around and see the granddaughter and say oh Is n't she the cut thing this person be not literally claim to have line up all the baby in the world accord to cuteness and discover his own grandchild tie for first rather he be try to express his emotion use word that be very object orient because this example be one that be common to many people nobody misunderstand the intent of the statements- the Bible however be often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true for those people the existence of Tyre be a problem- for I it be not turn to the late person try to defend Ezekiel we read this from John E King no it imply nothing of the kind if you have nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel and you be tell you interpret it literally you would never say oh he mean that there will be house and business and plant and stuff like that you would read I will make you a bare rock and you will never be rebuild and you 'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock the only way to get from   fishing nets to   house and building and a medium large population be if you know that all that latter stuff be there in other word your answer mean that Ezekiel mislead everybody who read the prophecy at the time it be write there be no way that give a literal reading they could read this passage and conclude medium size city you seem to feel that never be rebuild mean be rebuild maybe so but it be hardly a   clear implication well no That 's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis where I 'm from you know the Naval Acadamy the state capital George Washington resign his commission in the statehouse Annapolis may not be New York but it 's at least a two horse town but suppose 22,000 people be a small town it 's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predict and you 've say nothing about the other problem in chapter 26 Ezekiel predict that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuable however Nebuchadnezzar do not destroy Tyre and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quote God as say he and his army get no reward from the campaign he lead against Tyre Let 's ignore Alexander for a moment and just pay attention to chapter 26 Ezekiel say N. would destroy Tyre and N. do not destroy Tyre Ezekiel say that N. would plunder their valuable but N. do not plunder their valuable regardless of what you think about Tyre   now   the fact be that N. die before the place be destroy Ezekiel say N. be go to do it and N. do not   this post be of course pointless inerrantist have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as need to fit whatever they want it to say for example I expect Mr King to respond to the comment about Ezekiel 26 by pull some clear implication out of hat when Ezekiel say that N. would demolish your tower that clearly imply that the wall would still be stand so people would know where the tower use to be and when Ezekiel say that N. would demolish your fine house and throw your stone timber and rubble into the sea that clearly imply that N. would never set foot on the island and when Ezekiel write that N. would build a ramp up to your wall that clearly imply that N. would spend 13 year stomp around on the mainland and never get close to the wall see a few clear implication that be totally contrary to the text and you can reconcile anything you want;3
24;about a year ago I start work on a problem that appear to be very simple and turn out to be quite difficult I be wonder if anyone on the net have see this problem and hopefully some publish solution to it tthe problem be to draw an outline of a surface define by two roughly parallel cubic spline for input the problem essentially start with two set of point where each set of point be on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i.e. only extant between the edge but which exist in three dimensional space to draw the object we 1 fit a cubic spline through the point each spline be effectively tcompute as a sequence of line segment approximate the curve each spline have an equal number of segment we assume tthat the nth segment along each spline be roughly but not texactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable tmeasure 2 take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment tof the oppose spline use the pair of segment to form two ttriangle which will be fill in to color the surface 3 depth sort the triangle 4 take each triangle in sorted order project onto a 2D pixmap draw tand color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that be talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge tcolore with a special edge color tIt be the edge color in step 4 that be at the heart of the problem the idea be to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally have lot of break and gap in the edge of the surface the reason for this be fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problem and problem result from the project the spline if anything about this problem sound familiar we would appreciate know about other work in this area;1

46;from what I read the other fellow tell Salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb be supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a I assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instruction   over the phone   one must need some brain I would expect I read this in an article in the Australian Muslim Times the newspaper weekly of the Australian Muslim community if this be true perhaps one of the Muslims base in North America if they see this posting can elaborate I do n't deny this fact the thrust of my argument here be that a Salameh be accord to US law innocent as he have not be find guilty in a court of law as his guilt have not be establish it be wrong for people to make posting base on this assumption b Islam teach we   not   to harm innocent if Muslims who perhaps have not realize that Islam teach this perform such action it be   not    because   of the teaching of Islam but rather   in spite of   and   in contradiction to   the teaching of Islam this be an important distinction I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say Muslim in general anyone who call themselves a Muslim and do not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teaching of Islam be consider to be a Muslim thus one who might do thing contrary to Islam through ignorance for example do not suddenly   not   become a Muslim if one knowingly transgress islamic teaching and essential principle though then one do leave Islam the term Muslim be to be contrast with Mu'min which mean true believer however whether a Muslim be in reality a Mu'min be something know only by God and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term Mu'min use very much by Muslims in alt.atheism because it be not know to anybody except myself and God whether I for example be a true believer or not for example I could just be put on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here without anyone know thus when we say Muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teaching by Muslim we do not necessarily mean Mu'min or true believer in Islam;0
47;I will clarify my early quote god 's law be originally write for the Israelites Jesus change that fact by now make the Law applicable to all people not just the Jews gentile could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the save grace of God I never say that the Law be make obsolete by Jesus if anything he clarify the Law such as in that quote you make in the follow verse Jesus take several portion of the Law and expound upon the Law give clear meaning to what God intend if you 'll notice he also ream into the Pharisees for muck up the Law with their own contrived interpretation they know every letter of the Law and follow it with their head but not their heart that be why he point out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accept into the kingdom of Heaven People such as the Pharisees be those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angel that can dance on the head of a pin they have become legalistic rule maker religious lawyer who practice the letter of the Law but never really believe in it I think you will agree with I that there be in today 's world a lot of modern day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it what good be head knowledge if there be nothing in the heart Christianity be not just a set of rules- it 's a lifestyle that change one 's perspective and personal conduct and it demand obedience to God 's will some people can live by it but many other can not or will not that be their choice and I have to respect it because God respect it too God be with you;3

52;Rick Anderson reply to my letter with ra   in article   C5ELp2.L0Cacsu.buffalo.edu   ra   ra    well Jason it 's heretical in a few way the first point be that ra    this equate Lucifer and Jesus as be the same type of be ra    however Lucifer be a create being Thou   wast   perfect in thy ra    way from the day that thou wast create till iniquity be find in ra    thee Ezekiel 28:15 while

him- and without he be not any thing make ra    that be make John 1:1 3 and he be before all thing and by ra    he all thing consist Colossians 1:17 ra   ra   your inference from the Ezekiel and John passage that Lucifer be ra   create and that Jesus be not depend on a particular interpetation of ra   the word create one with which many Christians may not agree ra   grant the Mormon belief that all of god 's child include Christ ra   and Lucifer be eternally existent intelligence which be organize ra   into spirit child by God the term creation can apply equally well ra   to both of those passage just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to differ interpretation of create and say that many Christians may not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line be truth regardless of popularity of opinion also I find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the Mormon belief you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that be raise and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant the Bible state that Lucifer be create the Bible state that Jesus be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the LDS belief be that Jesus and Lucifer be the same ra    your point that we all be brother of Jesus and Lucifer be also ra    heretical since we be not innately brother and sister of Christ ra    we be adopt for ye have not receive the spirit of bondage ra    again to fear- but ye have receive the Spirit of adoption whereby ra    we cry Abba Father Romans 8:15)- and not the natural child ra    of

Person 's family may be a symbolic term in the New ra   Testament mormon believe that we be adopt into the House of ra   Israel through baptism and faith in Christ although some have express ra   belief that this do evince a physical change in our body the Mormon belief be that all be child of God literally there be nothing symbolic about it this however contradict what the Bible say the Bible teach that not everyone be a child of God the field be the world- the good seed be the child of the kingdom- but the tare be the child of the wicked   one- Matthew 13:38 I speak that which I have see with my Father and ye do that which ye have see with your father John 8:38 Ye do the deed of your father then say they to he we be not bear of fornication- we have one Father   even   God Jesus say unto they if God be your Father ye would love I for I proceed forth and come from God- neither come I of myself but he send I why do ye not understand my speech   even   because ye can not hear my word Ye be of   your   father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he be a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there be no truth in he when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he be a liar and the father of it John 8:41 44 and say o full of all subtilty and all mischief   thou   child of the devil   thou   enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not

Jesus a Jesus that can not be reconcile with the Jesus of ra    the Bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim ra    one as be true deny the other from be true accord to the ra    Bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true God and ra    not the construct of imagination ra   ra   ra   Robert with all due respect who die and leave you Chief Arbiter of ra   Correct Biblical Interpretation I do n't mean to be snotty about this ra   but the fact be that the Bible be so differently interpret by different ra   group of biblical scholar what do you think of the Jehovah 's ra   witness for example that to make reference to the Jesus of the ra   Bible be simply ridiculous whose Jesus of the Bible do you mean this be really a red herring it does n't address any issue raise but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the Bible does n't change what the Bible teach for example the fact that the Jehovah 's witness deny the Deity of Christ do not alter what the Bible teach   look for that bless hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ- Titus 2:13),Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to they that have obtain like precious faith with we through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ 2 Peter 1:1   on the Deity of Christ we first look to the Bible to see what it teach to discount or not even address what the Bible teach because there be some group that have differ view be self defeating to see what the Bible teach you have to look at the Bible ra    our lord 's mortality be essential to his own salvation   the ra    Promised Messiah   p. 456 he have to work out his own salvation by ra    do the will of the Father in all thing ibid p.54 he have

82;archive name atheism   logic alt atheism archive name logic last modify 5 April 1993 version 1.4 construct a Logical Argument although there be much argument on Usenet the general quality of argument find be poor this article attempt to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improve the general level of debate Logic be the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference   Concise OED   Logic allow we to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it be correct or not valid or invalid of course one do not need to study logic in order to reason correctly- nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic be often helpful when construct or analyze an argument note that no claim be be make here about whether logic be universally applicable the matter be very much open for debate this document merely explain how to use logic give that you have already decide that logic be the right tool for the job proposition or statement be the building block of a logical argument a proposition be a statement which be either true or false- for example it be rain or today be Tuesday proposition may be either assert say to be true or deny say to be false note that this be a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning the proposition be the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of word use to express it so God exist and there exist a God both express the same proposition an argument be to quote the Monty Python sketch a connected series of statement to establish a definite proposition an argument consist of three stage first of all the proposition which be necessary for the argument to continue be state these be call the premise of the argument they be the evidence or reason for accept the argument and its conclusion premise or assertion be often indicate by phrase such as because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously be often view with suspicion as it can be use to intimidate other into accept suspicious premise if something does n't seem obvious to you do n't be afraid to question it you can always say oh yes you 're right it be obvious when you 've hear the explanation next the premise be use to derive further proposition by a process know as inference in inference one proposition be arrive at on the basis of one or more other proposition already accept there be various form of valid inference the proposition arrive at by inference may then be use in further inference inference be often denote by phrase such as imply that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which be affirm on the basis of the premise and inference conclusion be often indicate by phrase such as therefore it follow that we conclude and so on the conclusion be often state as the final stage of inference for example every event have a cause premise the universe have a beginning premise all beginning involve an event premise this imply that the beginning of the universe involve an event inference therefore the universe have a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be call a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument- the term do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order give above- for example the conclusion might be state first and the premise state afterwards in support of the conclusion this be perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing recognize an argument be much hard than recognize premise or conclusion many people shower their writing with assertion without ever produce anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument some statement look like argument but be not for example if the Bible be accurate Jesus must either have be insane an evil liar or the Son of God this be not an argument it be a conditional statement it do not assert the premise which be necessary to support what appear to be its conclusion it also suffer from a number of other logical flaw but we 'll come to those later another example God create you- therefore do your duty to God the phrase do your duty to God be not a proposition since it be neither true nor false therefore it be not a conclusion and the sentence be not an argument finally causality be important consider a statement of the form a because B. if we 're interested in establish A and B be offer as evidence the statement be an argument if we 're try to establish the truth of B then it be not an argument it be an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start this be an argument my car will not start because there be something wrong with the engine this be an explanation there be two traditional type of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument be one which provide conclusive proof of its conclusion that be an argument where if the premise be true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument be either valid or invalid a valid argument be define as one where if the premise be true then the conclusion be true an inductive argument be one where the premise provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive argument be not valid or invalid- however we can talk about whether they be well or bad than other argument and about how probable their premise be there be form of argument in ordinary language which be neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive argument as they be often view as the most rigorous and convincing it be important to note that the fact that a deductive argument be valid do not imply that its conclusion hold this be because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true proposition however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contain only false proposition for example all insect have wing premise Woodlice be insect premise therefore woodlice have wing conclusion here the conclusion be not true because the argument 's premise be false if the argument 's premise be true however the conclusion would be true the argument be thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premise as in all fish live in the sea premise dolphin be fish premise therefore dolphin live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we can not do be reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premise we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication the symbol    denote implication- a be the premise B the conclusion T and F represent true and false respectively Premise Conclusion Inference a b ab F F T if the premise be false and the inference F T T valid the conclusion can be true or false T F F if the premise be true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid T T T if the premise be true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument be a valid argument whose premise be true a sound argument therefore arrive at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid argument with sound argument to delve far into the structure of logical argument would require lengthy discussion of linguistic and philosophy it be simple and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfall to be avoid when construct an argument these pitfall be know as fallacy in everyday English the term fallacy be use to refer to mistaken belief as well as to the faulty reasoning that lead to those belief this be fair enough but in logic the term be generally use to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appear valid or convincing so for the purpose of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appear to be correct but which can be see to be incorrect when examine more closely by study fallacy we aim to avoid be mislead by they the following list of fallacy be not intend to be exhaustive ARGUMENTUM ad baculum appeal to FORCE the appeal to Force be commit when the arguer resort to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it be often use by politician and can be summarize as might make right the force threaten need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example thus there be ample proof of the truth of the Bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM Argumentum ad hominem be literally argument direct at the man the abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occur when instead of try to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attack the person or people make the assertion this be invalid because the truth of an assertion do not depend upon the goodness of those assert it for example atheism be an evil philosophy it be practise by Communists and murderer sometimes in a court of law doubt be cast upon the testimony of a witness by show for example that he be a known perjurer this be a valid way of reduce the credibility of the testimony give by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem- however it do not demonstrate that the witness 's testimony be false to conclude otherwise be to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem be commit when a person argue that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent 's particular circumstance for example it be perfectly acceptable to kill animal for food how can you argue otherwise when you 're quite happy to wear leather shoe this be an abusive charge of inconsistency use as an excuse for dismiss the opponent 's argument this fallacy can also be use as a means of reject a conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination be a bad thing you 're white this particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem when one allege that one 's adversary be rationalize a conclusion form from selfish interest be also know as poison the well ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ad ignorantium mean argument from ignorance this fallacy occur whenever it be argue that something must be true simply because it have not be prove false or equivalently when it be argue that something must be false because it have not be prove true note that this be not the same as assume that something be false until it have be prove true a basic scientific principle example of course the Bible be true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomenon do not exist nobody have show any proof that they be real note that this fallacy do not apply in a court of law where one be generally assume innocent until prove guilty also in scientific investigation if it be know that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occur the absence of such evidence can validly be use to infer that the event do not occur for example a flood as describe in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth do not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which be freeze into ice at the pole therefore no such flood occur in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something have not occur we can not conclude with certainty that it have not occur however ARGUMENTUM ad misericordiam this be the Appeal to Pity also know as Special Pleading the fallacy be commit when the arguer appeal to pity for the sake of get a conclusion accept for example I do not murder my mother and father with an axe please do n't find I guilty- I 'm suffer enough through be an orphan ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM this be know as Appealing to the Gallery or appeal to the People to commit this fallacy be to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appeal to a large group of people this form of fallacy be often characterize by emotive language for example Pornography must be ban it be violence against woman the Bible must be true million of people know that it be be you try to tell they that they be all mistaken fool ARGUMENTUM ad numeram this fallacy be closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consist of assert that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it be that that proposition be correct ARGUMENTUM ad verecundiam the appeal to Authority use the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example Isaac Newton be a genius and he believe in God this line of argument be not always completely bogus- for example reference to an admit authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between Stephen Hawking have conclude that black hole give off radiation and John Searle have conclude that it be impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking be a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinion on black hole radiation to be inform Searle be a linguist so it be questionable whether he be well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the Fallacy of Accident be commit when a general rule be apply to a particular case whose accidental circumstance mean that the rule be inapplicable it be the error make when one go from the general to the specific for example Christians generally dislike atheist you be a Christian so you must dislike atheist this fallacy be often commit by moralist and legalist who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically apply general rule CONVERSE ACCIDENT   HASTY GENERALIZATION this fallacy be the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occur when one form a general rule by examine only a few specific case which be not representative of all possible case for example Jim Bakker be an insincere Christian therefore all Christians be insincere sweeping GENERALIZATION   DICTO simpliciter a sweeping generalization occur when a general rule be apply to a particular situation in which the feature of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweeping generalization be the opposite of a hasty generalization NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA   POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC these be know as False Cause fallacy the fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occur when one identify something as the cause of an event but it have not actually be show to be the cause for example I take an aspirin and pray to God and my headache disappear so God cure I of the headache the fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occur when something be assume to be the cause of an event merely because it happen before the event for example the Soviet Union collapse after take up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reason CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC this fallacy be similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it assert that because two event occur together they must be causally relate and leave no room for other factor that may be the cause(s of the event PETITIO PRINCIPII this fallacy occur when the premise be at least as questionable as the conclusion reach CIRCULUS in DEMONSTRANDO this fallacy occur when one assume as a premise the conclusion which one wish to reach often the proposition will be rephrase so that the fallacy appear to be a valid argument for example homosexual must not be allow to hold government office hence any government official who be reveal to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexual will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexual can not be allow to hold government office note that the argument be entirely circular- the premise be the same as the conclusion an argument like the above have actually be cite as the reason for the British Secret Services official ban on homosexual employee another example be the classic we know that God exist because the Bible tell we so and we know that the Bible be true because it be the word of God COMPLEX QUESTION   fallacy of interrogation this be the Fallacy of Presupposition one example be the classic load question have you stop beat your wife the question presuppose a definite answer to another question which have not even be ask this trick be often use by lawyer in cross examination when they ask question like where do you hide the money you stole similarly politician often ask loaded question such as how long will this EC interference in our affair be allow to continue or do the Chancellor plan two more year of ruinous privatization IGNORATIO ELENCHI the fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consist of claim that an argument support a particular conclusion when it be actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a Christian may begin by say that he will argue that the teaching of Christianity be undoubtably true if he then argue at length that Christianity be of great help to many people no matter how well he argue he will not have show that christian teaching be true sadly such fallacious argument be often successful because they arouse emotion which cause other to view the suppose conclusion in a more favourable light EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occur when a key word be use with two or more different meaning in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remain free that user can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occur when the premise use in an argument be ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing ACCENT Accent be another form of fallacy through shift meaning in this case the meaning be change by alter which part of a statement be emphasize for example consider we should not speak ILL of our friend and we should not speak ill of our friend fallacy of COMPOSITION one fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property share by the part of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle be make entirely of low mass component and be therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition be to conclude that a property of a number of individual item be share by a collection of those item for example a car use less petrol and cause less pollution than a bus therefore car be less environmentally damaging than bus FALLACY of division the fallacy of division be the opposite of the fallacy of composition like its opposite it exist in two variety the first be to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its part for example you be study at a rich college therefore you must be rich the other be to assume that a property of a collection of item be share by each item for example ant can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree the SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT this argument state that should one event occur so will other harmful event there be no proof make that the harmful event be cause by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we 'll have a nation full of drug addict on welfare therefore we can not legalize marijuana a be base ON B FALLACIES   be a type of fallacy these fallacy occur when one attempt to argue that thing be in some way similar without actually specify in what way they be similar example is n't history base upon faith if so then is n't the Bible also a form of history Islam be base on faith Christianity be base on faith so is n't Islam a form of Christianity cat be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry dog be a form of animal base on carbon chemistry so are n't dog a form of cat affirmation of the consequent this fallacy be an argument of the form a imply b B be true therefore a be true to understand why it be a fallacy examine the truth table for implication give early denial of the antecedent this fallacy be an argument of the form a imply b a be false therefore b be false again the truth table for implication make it clear why this be a fallacy note that this fallacy be different from Non Causa Pro Causa- the latter have the form a imply b a be false therefore b be false where a do not in fact imply b at all here the problem be not that the implication be invalid- rather it be that the falseness of A do not allow we to deduce anything about B. convert a conditional this fallacy be an argument of the form if a then b therefore if B then a. ARGUMENTUM ad antiquitam this be the fallacy of assert that something be right or good simply because it be old or because that be the way it 's always be ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM this be the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam- it be the fallacy of assert that something be more correct simply because it be new or new than something else ARGUMENTUM ad crumenam the fallacy of believe that money be a criterion of correctness- that those with more money be more likely to be right ARGUMENTUM ad LAZARUM the fallacy of assume that because someone be poor he or she be sounder or more virtuous than one who be wealthy this fallacy be the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam ARGUMENTUM ad NAUSEAM this be the incorrect belief that an assertion be more likely to be true the more often it be hear an argumentum ad nauseum be one that employ constant repetition in assert something bifurcation also refer to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occur when one present a situation as have only two alternative where in fact other alternative exist or can exist PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM   many question this fallacy occur when a questioner demand a simple answer to a complex question NON SEQUITUR a non sequitur be an argument where the conclusion be draw from premise which be not logically connect with it RED HERRING this fallacy be commit when irrelevant material be introduce to the issue be discuss so that everyone 's attention be divert away from the point be make towards a different conclusion REIFICATION   HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occur when an abstract concept be treat as a concrete thing shift the BURDEN of proof the burden of proof be always on the person make an assertion or proposition shift the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium be the fallacy of put the burden of proof on the person who deny or question the assertion be make the source of the fallacy be the assumption that something be true unless prove otherwise STRAW MAN the straw man fallacy be to misrepresent someone else 's position so that it can be attack more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position have be demolish it be a fallacy because it fail to deal with the actual argument that have be make the extended ANALOGY the fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occur when some suggest general rule be be argue over the fallacy be to assume that mention two different situation in an argument about a general rule constitute a claim that those situation be analogous to each other this fallacy be well explain use a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation I believe it be always wrong to oppose the law by break it such a position be odious it imply that you would not have support Martin Luther King be you say that cryptography legislation be as important as the struggle for black liberation how dare you TU QUOQUE this be the famous you too fallacy it occur when an action be argue to be acceptable because the other party have perform it for instance you 're just be randomly abusive so You 've be abusive too;0
83;do you question the existence of Alexander the great Tilgrath Pilisar III Nero Caligula Josephus Cyrus the great Artexerxes their document have decay to dust too Brian why another excuse Peter write a bit of the Bible what Peter say about God be what the Bible say consider the Bible a court recording over the period of thousand of year various people come up and testify of their experience with the live God up come Abraham the wealthy rancher up come Moses once the high official of Egypt up come Elijah a priest up come David a mere shepherd who become King up come the pagan King Nebuchanezzar up come the pagan King of Persia Cyrus up come Nehemiah cupbearer to the King of Persia then Matthew an IRS agent take the stand up come Luke an M.D. then Paul a Jew who use to kill Christians for fun up come John a 17 year old boy up come Peter a fisherman up come James the brother of Jesus himself up come hundred of other you hear testimony from fisherman IRS agent priest king the court hearing last thousand of year with people come up and testify about the God who call himself I be while you be listen to all this stuff you realize that King David could have never know John Solomon could have never know Matthew Nehemiah could have never know Peter you realize that all these people be independent witness and so you rule out collaboration yet all of the witness tell of the same God each testifier tell of his own experience with the live God each experience be different but each experience have enough cross over to unmistakenly reveal that each one of these people be talk about the very same God what Daniel do not know about God the 3rd Highest Official of Babylon God reveal to John 600 year later but with a different perspective no two testimony be identical each testimony dare to venture off what be already know yet each witness 's testimony even though different from those prior consistently describe harmoniously fitting facet of the character of the same God now as we stare gaze at the computer you get this seem fanatic on the other end of the net say I know this God I be he have reveal himself to I too he also call himself Jesus John 8:58 please believe I I be tell the truth it be wonderful to know he;3

95;Did n't Christ tell his disciple to arm they self shortly before his crusifiction I believe the exact quote be along the line of if you have   something   sell it and buy a sword this from a guy who preach love deference of power to God and renunciation of worldly life in exchange for a life of the spirit if Jesus do in fact command his disciple to arm themselves I would take that as yet another reason to reject christian doctrine for whatever it 's worth like most religion the doctrine have good and bad in it I would certainly reject the current implementation of the doctrine no the above be a classic example of take a scripture out of context It 's take from Luke 22:36 but note vs 37- for I tell you that this which be write must be accomplish in I namely and he will be reckon with lawless ones he then state that two sword be enough for the group to carry to be count as lawless so have more than the politically correct number of weapon be cause to be arrese and kill even then huh Jesus overiding message be one of peace turn other cheek- live by sword die by sword- etc yes of course as in Matthew 10:34 35 do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth- it be not peace I have come to bring but a sword RJL;3

100;this be a good point but I think average people do not take up Christianity so much out of fear or escapism but quite simply as a way to improve their social life or to get more involved with american culture if they be kid of immigrant for example since it be the overwhelming major religion in the Western World in some form or other it be simply the choice people take if they be bored and want to do something new with their life but not somethong too new or TOO out of the ordinary seem a little weak but as long as it does n't hurt anybody these be good quote and I agree with both of they but let 's make sure to alter the scond one so that include something like let he be as long as he be not prevent other from find their peace or something like that of course I suppose if someone be REALLY at peace there would be no need for inflict evangelism well it be a sure thing we will have to live with they all our life their popularity seem to come and go I remember when I first enter High School I be an atheist always have be and so be about 7 of my friend at this time 5 of those 7 have convert always to Christianity they be all also immigrant from Taiwan or son of immigrant hence my early gross generalization Christianity seem a lot more popular to people now than it ever have before since I 've be notice maybe it be just my perception that be chagne who know I for one be perfectly willing to live and let live with they so long as we have some set of abstract right   agreement on how we should treat each other I have no desire to be hurt by they or their notion for all the well put argument on this usenet it never do any good argumentation do not really seem to apply to Christians or even some atheists)- it must simply be a step the person take naturally almost instinctively good regard                                                                                   Adam John cooperttverily often have I laugh at the weakling    tttt who think themselves good simply because    acoopermacalstr.eduttttthey have no claws.t                                                                                  ;0

119;  why do baby get disease etc   Here be the main problem the scenario you outline be reasonably consistent but all the evidence that I be familiar with not only do not support it but indicate something far different the Earth by late estimate be about 4.6 billion year old and have have life for about 3.5 billion of those year human have only be around for at most about 200,000 year but the fossil evidence inidcate that life have be change and evolve and in fact disease ride long before there be people yes there be fossil that show sign of disease mostly bone disorder of course but there be some heck not just fossil evidence but what we 've be able to glean from genetic study show that disease have be around for a long long time if human sin be what bring about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before human   deletion   uh I know of many evolutionary biologist who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there be no evidence that the human genetic code or any other starte off in perfect condition it seem to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense I 'm really curious as to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code Umm Nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapt to virus and bacteria and they to we only a very small percentage of microlife be harmful to human and that small percentage seem to be reasonalby constant in size but the rank keep change for example bubonic plague use to be a really nasty disease I 'm sure you 'll agree but it still pop up from time to time even today and does n't do as much damage part of that be because of well sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptom tend to be less severe than in the past this seem to be partly because people who be very susceptible die off long ago and because the really nasty variant overgrazed forgive the poor terminology I 'm an engineer not a doctor and die off for lack of nearby host I could be wrong on this but from what I gather acne be only a few hundred year old and use to be nasty though no killer it seem to be get less nasty w   age now wait a minute I have a question human be create perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seem unlikely that Satan who 's make the disease would also gift human with the mean to fight they off simple to make the disease less lethal if he want survivor as far as I can see our immune system imperfect though they may presently be must have be build into we by God I want to be clear on this be you say that God be plan ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by build an immune system that be not at the time of design necessary that is God make our immune system ahead of time know that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendent would need to fight off disease Here be another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in the phrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfect system would be incapable of degrade over time a perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect be   not   a perfect system at least IMHO or be it that God do something like write a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrapper hold together with Elmer 's glue that is the original genetic instructions be perfect but be written in inferior material that have to be carefully tend or would fall apart if so why could God not have use well material be God   incapable   of create a system that could maintain itself of do it just choose not to   deletion   my main point as I say be that there really is n't any evidence for the explanation you give at least that I 'm aware of but I could n't help make a few nitpick here and there sincerely;0

127;the two commandment   be   rules- they be merely rule that be so vague that they be practically devoid of meaning Michael Siemon acknowledge this every time he write that the resolution of an argument over they turn on secular and cultural assumption that be independent of these rule the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be view in part as remind man that he be not God and can not act as if he have ultimate responsibility indeed many tradition present an interpretation where believer be suppose to interpret love one 's neighbor as follow various other rule and rely on their god to make thing come out right precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate responsibility once again we be confront with good sound goo that mean whatever the reader want it to mean and who be to say that this interpretation be twist there be many passage in the Bible that in their most straightforward reading show the christian god behave in just this way Michael can not refer to base claim or base commandment to show that such reading be twisted because this divergence in understanding occur even in try to interpret the base claim and commandment in address conservative Christians Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notion that these conservative Christians will reject but these base commandment be too vague to serve as a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical system the meaning of these base commandment for any believer derive from the secular and cultural notion that the believer bring to they from how the believer mix their demand with straightforward reading of other biblical passage from a particular sectarian tradition or from some combination of these thing these commandment lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticize ethical system what mean they have come from the ethical system the believer bring to these commandment Jesus explicitly state that this summarize jewish law which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it mean to love God and love our neighbor there be   many   parable and teaching the gospel attribute to Jesus that be straightforwardly read as ethical commandment the Pauline epistle be similarly full if it be not clear that these all come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior the problem be   not   a lack of raw material no Michael the conservative Christians also take the gospel seriously what differentiate you be the way you interpret the gospel in a sense the wide variety of interpretation do tell we something about Christianity it tell we that the New Testament author leave a sufficiently vague hodge podge that it can serve as the source text for many vastly different belief about the nature of the christian god and about what man should and should n't do the irony here be that there be   nothing   in Christianity per se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbian and gay   every   christian principle he turn to this cause be effective only through the extra christian principle through which Michael interpret his religion and the homophobe apply the   same   christian principle with equal justification to their cause in short it be the extra christian principle that make Michael 's Christianity beneficial and I suspect they would be as beneficial perhaps moreso without be filter by christian interpretation Michael paint a picture of standard american atheism as the rejection of the evil in many conservative christian interpretation of the Bible but I think it be even more damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament present such a vague hodge podge of notion about the nature of God and the nature of the good except of course when it be order by an interpretation that rely on extraneous principle here I think we should apply a Christian parable where a cold drink can have its value and a hot drink can have its value but the lukewarm we should spit out;3

Fahrenheit now revise to 900 degree F. world with a cloud cover atmosphere compose primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid be later confirm in 1978 MARINER 3 launch on November 5 1964 be lose when its protective shroud fail to eject as the craft be place into interplanetary space unable to collect the Sun 's energy for power from its solar panel the probe soon die when its battery run out and be now in solar orbit it be intend for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4 MARINER 4 the sister probe to MARINER 3 do reach Mars in 1965 and take the first close up image of the martian surface 22 in all as it fly by the planet the probe find a cratered world with an atmosphere much thin than previously think many scientist conclude from this preliminary scan that Mars be a dead world in both the geological and biological sense MARINER 5 be send to Venus in 1967 it reconfirm the datum on that planet collect five year early by MARINER 2 plus the information that Venus atmospheric pressure at its surface be at least 90 time that of Earth 's or the equivalent of be 3,300 foot under the surface of an ocean MARINER 6 and 7 be send to Mars in 1969 and expand upon the work do by MARINER 4 four year early however they fail to take away the concept of Mars as a dead planet first make from the basic measurement of MARINER 4 MARINER 8 end up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot fail MARINER 9 the sister probe to MARINER 8 become the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971 it return information on the Red Planet that no other probe have do before reveal huge volcano on the martian surface as well as giant canyon system and evidence that water once flow across the planet the probe also take the first detailed closeup image of Mars two small moon Phobos and Deimos MARINER 10 use Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974 the probe do return the first close up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet reveal previously unseen detail in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in four Earth day MARINER 10 eventually make three flyby of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before run out of attitude control gas the probe reveal Mercury as a heavily cratere world with a mass much great than think this would seem to indicate that Mercury have an iron core which make up 75 percent of the entire planet PIONEER MOON

useless low orbit which quickly decay RANGER 3 launch on January 26 1962 be intend to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon but problem during the launch cause the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit ranger 3 do try to take some image of the Moon as it fly by but the camera be unfortunately aim at deep space during the attempt RANGER 4 launch April 23 1962 have the same purpose as RANGER 3 but suffer technical problem enroute and crash on the lunar farside the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon albeit without return datum RANGER 5 launch October 18 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4 lose all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually miss the Moon and drift off into solar orbit ranger 6 through 9 have more modify lunar mission they be to send back live image of the lunar surface as they head towards an impact with the Moon ranger 6 fail this objective in 1964 when its camera do not operate ranger 7 through 9 perform well become the first U.S. lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through 1965 LUNAR ORBITER LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 be design to orbit the Moon and image various site be study as land area for the manned APOLLO mission of 1969 1972 the probe also contribute greatly to our understanding of lunar surface feature particularly the lunar farside all five probe of the series launch from 1966 to 1967 be essentially successful in their mission they be the first U.S. probe to orbit the Moon all lo be eventually crash into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO mission SURVEYOR lunar soft LANDERS the SURVEYOR series be design primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sink into the soil before this time it be fear by some that the Moon be cover in great layer of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle SURVEYOR be successful in prove that the lunar surface be strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968 only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 be unsuccessful mission the rest become the first U.S. probe to soft land on the Moon take thousand of image and scoop the soil for analysis APOLLO

western slope of Chryse Planitia on July 20 1976 it soon begin its program search for Martian micro organism there be still debate as to whether the probe find life there or not and send back incredible color panorama of its surrounding one thing scientist learn be that Mars sky be pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally think the sky be pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust particle in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulder stretch out as far as its camera could image the VIKING 1 orbiter keep function until August 7 1980 when it run out of attitude control propellant the lander be switch into a weather report mode where it have be hope it would keep function through 1994- but after November 13 1982 an errant command have be send to the lander accidentally tell it to shut down until further order communication be never regain again despite the engineers effort through May of 1983 an interesting side note

can be attach to the lander by a manned expedition vike 2 be launch on September 9 1975 and arrive in martian orbit on August 7 1976 the lander touch down on September 3 1976 in Utopia Planitia it accomplish essentially the same task as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer work record one marsquake the orbiter have a series of attitude control gas leak in 1978 which prompt it be shut down that July the lander be shut down on April 12 1980 the orbit of both viking orbiter should decay around 2025 VOYAGER outer PLANET FLYBYS VOYAGER 1 be launch September 5 1977 and fly past Jupiter on March 5 1979 and by Saturn on November 13 1980 VOYAGER 2 be launch August 20 1977 before VOYAGER 1 and fly by Jupiter on August 7 1979 by Saturn on August 26 1981 by Uranus on January 24 1986 and by Neptune on August 8 1989 VOYAGER 2 take advantage of a rare once every-189 year alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet VOYAGER 1 could in principle have head towards Pluto but JPL opt for the sure thing of a Titan close up between the two probe our knowledge of the 4 giant planet their satellite and their ring have become immense VOYAGER 12 discover that Jupiter have complicate atmospheric dynamic lightning and aurorae three new satellite be discover two of the major surprise be that Jupiter have ring and that Io have active sulfurous volcano with major effect on the Jovian magnetosphere when the two probe reach Saturn they discover over 1000 ringlet and 7 satellite include the predict shepherd satellite that keep the ring stable the weather be tame compare with Jupiter massive jet stream with minimal variance a 33 year great white spot   band cycle be know Titan 's atmosphere be smoggy Mimas appearance be startling one massive impact crater give it the Death Star appearance the big surprise here be the stranger aspect of the ring braid kink and spoke be both unexpected and difficult to explain VOYAGER 2 thank to heroic engineering and programming effort continue the mission to Uranus and Neptune Uranus itself be highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity be that its magnetic axis be find to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis give Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channel be find on Ariel and Miranda be a bizarre patchwork of different terrain 10 satellite and one more ring be discover in contrast to Uranus Neptune be find to have rather active weather include numerous cloud feature the ring arc turn out to be bright patch on one ring two other ring and 6 other satellite be discover Neptune 's magnetic axis be also skew Triton have a canteloupe appearance and geyser What 's liquid at 38 K the two voyager be expect to last for about two more decade their on target journeying give negative evidence about possible planet beyond Pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause SOVIET planetary mission since there have be so many soviet probe to

of the Moon Mars Venus and various comet have be plan for the 1990s and a Mercury mission to orbit and land probe on the tiny world have be plan for 2003 how the many change in the former Soviet Union now the Commonwealth of Independent States will affect the future of their space program remain to be see japanese planetary MISSIONS SAKIGAKE MS T5 be launch from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on January 8 1985 and approach Halley 's Comet within about 7 million km on March 11 1986 the spacecraft be carry three instru- ment to measure interplanetary magnetic field   plasma wave   solar wind all of which work normally now so ISAS make an Earth swingby by Sakigake on January 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth 's the close approach be at 23h08m47s JST   UTC9h on January 8 1992 the geocentric distance be 88,997 km this be the first planet swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach Sakigake observe the geotail some geotail passage will be schedule in some year hence the second Earth swingby will be on June 14 1993 at 40 Re Earth 's radius and the third October 28 1994 at 86 re HITEN a small lunar probe be launch into Earth orbit on January 24 1990 the spacecraft be then know as MUSES A but be rename to Hiten once in orbit the 430 lb probe loop out from Earth and make its first lunary flyby on March 19 where it drop off its 26 lb midget satellite HAGOROMO Japan at this point become the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon join the Unites States and USSR the small spacecraft Hagoromo remain in orbit around the Moon an apparently break transistor radio cause the japanese space scientist to lose track of it Hagoromo 's rocket motor fire on schedule on March 19 but the spacecraft 's tracking transmitter fail immediately the rocket firing of Hagoromo be optically confirm use the Schmidt camera 105 cm F3.1 at the Kiso Observatory in Japan Hiten make multiple lunar flyby at approximately monthly interval and perform aerobrake experiment use the Earth 's atmosphere hiten make a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST UTC9h on February 15 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon 's surface 35.3n 9.7e and fire its

particular space mission and periodical source on space probe this list be by no means complete- it be primarily design to give you place to start your research through generally available work on the subject if anyone can add pertinent work to the list it would be greatly appreciate though naturally I recommend all the book list below I think it would be good if you start out with the general overview book in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area I also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general work on astronomy and the Sol system to give you some extra background Most of these book and periodical can be find in any good public and university library some of the more recently publish work can also be purchase in andor order

154;  in   mcclaryc5snpq.kb1netcom.com   mcclarynetcom.com Michael McClary   just think i 'd clear up a few of the murky area     actually after survive be drive out of Nauvoo and late carthage    the Mormons do fortify Utah they still arm themselves to defend the    faith and stockpile food as well they have be involve in quite a    lot of illegal activity include multiple and often underage wife    for the leader a practice still in vogue with some splinter of their    sect the parallel between Koresh and Joseph Smith be strike    by they you mean the leader of the lds church I grant you that when Joseph Smith be still alive plenty of accusation be file most of which have little bearing with reality as evidence by various verdict I have study lds history for 15 year now and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership be involve in quote illegal activity plural marriage yes but your charge of underage wife sound like it could have originate from a tabloid and discredit the high moral standard which characterize these leader and family unlike as it appear those of David Koresh   Joseph Smith start the sect after he and his brother Hyram   be murder in a Nauvoo Il jail cell church membership split over   who to follow initially Smith be consider a prophet just like   Mohammed a rather interesting parallel consider Muslims consider   Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews I 'm lead to understand make   no mistake this be no messiah we 're talk about in Smith the and neither do he claim he be as the church reflect the moral aptitude of its leader and especially those of Joseph Smith I have nothing but the high respect for this inspire man whose only crime be that he refuse to deny that he have see a vision many have try to explain the Smith phenomenon away but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stand as a witness that Joseph Smith 's testimony have enough resilience and power to carry on the message   think at the time be that the gift of prophecy be to be hand   down father to son after Joseph Smith die his son be only   enter his teen Brigham Young and a few other claim to have   be bequeath the gift and leadership prior to his death the   Council of Twelve the Church govern body was n't of much help   here and this basic conflict be still a wedge between the sect   Brigham Young take his follower to Salt Lake the rest wait   for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership the other   claimant to the leadership be soon ignore like Mike Dukakis the rest be apostate and excommunicate member of the Church while the great majority of the membership the Twelve and the various auxiliary organization choose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church if you know your lds scripture and doctrine you would have know that Brigham Young be the first in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith 's vacancy he be the senior apostle in the Quorum and various comment make by Joseph indicate that it be Brigham who would lead the latter day exodus to the West other rightful heir be either dead Hyrum Smith or excommunicate Oliver Cowdery and while persecution abound and intensify Joseph Smith have already give order to look for a new place an empty land beyond the boundary of the United States at that time this Rekhabite principle pseudographia be well understand and antipate by the great majority of lds faithful and be not question by they grant a couple of do it yourselfer stay behind unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown but this also be necessary to separate the tare from the wheat the church benefit from this purification process they become even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world   both sect practice the 1 year food stockpile doctrine   and this be frontier and farming country most carry or at   least own weapon there be little evidence that they be a   militaristic sect give that they tend to move on rather than   face large scale opposition Brigham Young having suffer a   great deal get to Salt Lake seem to have be quite   justify in make military training a good thing remember   this be far beyond where even the US Army go and these people   have nobody to turn to save themselves    just a little context to put this all in perspective BTW since when be the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saint one of the large denomination in the country a sect it did n't splinter from any other religion as do say the Southern Baptists or Methodists    so what do the Mormons get it seem that J. Edgar Hoover be very    impress with the way they keep secret They 're pledge to defend    secret with their life and atone for sin with blood many actually    do even to the point of suicide what a balloney Suicide be sinful and against the law of God I be not comfortable with this allege cosiness with Mammon I assure you that   many   among we reject this attitude categorically Period our only true allegiance be to our God and to the leader which he have appoint to represent he in any regard to read this trash about suicide and atone for sin with blood be yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believe in and stand for    the rlds the reorganize lds be friendly rival of the lds   and delight in tell story about they which generate quick retort   from the LDS member and everybody have a grand time at no time have   I ever even hear this hint at I 'm take it with a salt block make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top    so he hire virtually no one but    Mormons until the FBI be almost exclusively staff by member of the    church of Later Day saint though J. Edgar be finally go the FBI    personnel especially the field agent be still heavily Mormon    I have often wonder how this might affect the FBI 's treatment    of religious organization a Mormon would consider heretical Preposterous even if this be true reliable datum please I be convinced that those officer would perform to the high code of honor and conduct that be why they be select for in the first place remember besides one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY state the principle of freedom of religion and that all people be free to worship   how     where   or   what   they may   if it 's true there would be little affect lds and rlds   philosophy be that all other religion have stray from the true   Church as set down by Jesus but that God will judge each on his   own merit in addition the rlds also contend and the LDS may   as well that ignorance of the true Way tm be an excuse you   can only be condemn if you have be tought the way and reject   it in short lds and rlds suffer everybody from Lutherans to   buddhist secure in the knowledge that though they be wrong they   will not be penalize for ignorance it be more likely that Hoover   like they because of their rather strict upbringing which forbid   alcohol tobacco hot drink like coffee or tea and the like   these people be the salt of the Earth and as such be more   easily make to follow order and have few vice to be use against they a good explanation I can accept that you be right that lds people be sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon 's order the late president Kimball for example be an exception with his strong opposition of the selection of the MX Peace Keeper missile maze in Utah   That be my somewhat educate guess anyway both sect have   splinter group that do n't mirror the masse but these be small   and rare and hardly worth note their common ancestry    none of this have any relevance to gun though when a   man 's religion be use to deny he the right of self protection with   the weapon suitable for the job he 'll find an ally in I     Dan Sorenson DoD   1066 z1danexnet.iastate.edu vikingiastate.edu     ISU only censor what I read not what I say do n't blame they     USENET post to exotic distant machine meet exciting     unusual people and flame they  ;3

Hardin for immediate RELEASE April 15 1993   1506 scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carry instrument design to measure and study chemical in the Earth 's ozone layer the April 3 flight from California 's Barstow   Daggett Airport reach an altitude of 37 kilometer 121,000 foot and take measurement as part of a program establish to correlate datum with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite UARS the datum from the balloon flight will also be compare to reading from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy ATMOS experiment which be currently fly onboard the shuttle Discovery we launch these balloon several time a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program in fact JPL be actively involve in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important way say Dr. Jim Margitan principal investigator on the balloon research campaign there be two JPL instrument on the UARS satellite he continue the atmo experiment be conduct by JPL scientist and the JPL balloon research provide collaborative ground truth for those activity as well as datum that be useful in its own right the measurement take by the balloon payload will add more piece to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere specifically the mid latitude stratosphere during winter and spring understand the chemistry occur in this region help scientist construct more accurate computer model which be instrumental in predict future ozone condition the scientific balloon payload consist of three JPL instrument an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measure ozone as the balloon ascend and descend through the atmosphere- a submillimeterwave limb sounder which look at microwave radiation emit by molecule in the atmosphere- and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitor how the atmosphere absorb sunlight Launch occur at about noontime and follow a three- hour ascent the balloon float eastward at approximately 130 kilometer per hour 70 knot Data be radio to ground station and record onboard the flight end at 10 p.m. pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload be command to separate from the balloon we need to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurement Margitan explain and we also need to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecule disappear it will be several week before scientist will have the complete result of their experiment they will then forward their datum to the UARS central datum facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland for use by the UARS scientist the balloon be launch by the National Scientific Balloon Facility normally base in Palestine Tex operate under a contract from NASA 's Wallops Flight Facility the balloon be launch in California because of the west to east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest the balloon be make of 20 micron 0.8 mil or less than one thousandth of an inch thick plastic and be 790,000 cubic meter 28 million cubic foot in volume when fully inflate with helium 120 meter 400 foot in diameter the balloon weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilogram 3,000 and 4,000 pound the scientific payload weigh about 1,300 kilogram 3,000 pound and be 1.8 meter six foot square by 4.6 meter 15 foot high the JPL balloon research be sponsor by NASA 's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program;2
161;I believe the reason be that the lung diaphram get too tired to pump the liquid in and out and simply stop breathe after 2 3 minute so if your in the vehicle ready to go they well not put you on hold or else That be about it remember a liquid be several more time as dense as a gas by its very nature 10 I think depend on the gas and liquid comparision of course;2

166;I be seek some alternate solution on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygon that can be subsequently scan convert by a 3d scanline renderer I have be study the problem of font conversion for a few year but have never have the need to implement such a system well I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my question answer before I jump into the deep end the main problem I face be how to use the even   odd or non winding rule to turn the outline into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygon so there be no need to reduce the polygon to simple polygon for example in the letter o there be two outline t1 the outside outline which be clockwise TrueType font t2 the inside outline which be counterclockwise one common solution use by a number of rendering package be to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outline be close this be equivalent to descibe a polygon with hole the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edge be in the opposite direction to the outside edge I do not want to use this simplistic system since t1 it will not handle all outline font properly it be not a simple ttmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for ttsome fancy font t2 it do not properly handle the even   odd or non winding rule from my research over the year the proper solution be to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outline into trapezoid as be do by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizer these trapezoidal polygon can then be easily and properly render by the 3d scanline renderer my question be be there any well solution to turn the outline into polgyon other than the trapezoid decomposer I be not fond of this solution since it create excess number of polygon another question for those in the know what be the good algorithm to create bevel andor offset curve for font outline I have a dozen paper on these subject but I ca n't tell which method be the good to implement thank for any pointer   Rob Lansdale;1
167;Jesus black and white a spade be a spade there be no hidden agenda behind this so stop try to look for one it be an easy and as straight forward as it read Kent I be not accuse you of evil thing Jesus be accuse you and it be not only you that he be accuse he be accuse everyone I you and everyone in the world be guilty whether one see the light or do not see the light have nothing to do with whether we do evil thing we do they regardless Jesus use the word man I be include Jesus be not solo you out Jesus be make a general statement about out the sad state of man christian be not immune from do evil thing a Christian be just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwell a Christian can see the evil he be do because his evil have be bring out into the light Jesus be not say that just because evil have be expose that the Christian will stop do evil if you have n't see Jesus 's light your evil deed simply have n't be expose to the his light you may shed some light on your own your human spirit shine at perhaps 1 candela but the Holy Spirit shine at a Megacandela the Holy Spirit can shine light into place inside we where we did n't even know exist so do you see Jesus 's point Christians be not perfect Nonchristians be not perfect Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problem in their life and they will not like the sight it be an ugly thing to see how far we have fall from Jesus 's perspective do you think you want to know how really ignorant you be do you think Brian Kendig want to know do you think I want to know ego verse the truth which do you choose and I watch Koresh too an imposter who think he see the light who make sure that the 19 child burn to death sadly as part of his delusion it be even sad that the people who die with he choose to die with they and that ignorance be their downfall to death and Kent do n't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bring up Koresh as if Koresh actually have truth in he David Koresh be no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ David Koresh who claim to be Jesus be a fraud it be obvious David Koresh be bear in America Jesus be bear in Bethlehem Koresh was n't even a good imposter having miss an obvious point as that Jesus warn of such imposter in the end time David Koresh was n't anything new to Jesus Jesus tell we to be aware of imposter 2000 year ago so the next time an imposter make a scene and claim to be Jesus ask the obvious where be you bear be your mother 's name Mary if the Branch Davidians ask that simple question they would have label Koresh a liar right from the start the would n't have follow Koresh they would n't have die but look what happen their ignorance cost they their life their choice to be ignorant cost they a lot Kent since you study the Bible under Lutheranism do you not remember what tactic Satan use to try to tempt Jesus do not Satan quote the Bible out of context do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis use to tempt Eve do he not misquote God what Satan use on Eve and succeed be the same ploy he try on Jesus but in Jesus 's case Jesus rebuke Satan back with the Bible   in   context it did n't work with Jesus do what Satan do to Eve in the Garden and what Satan try to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh do to his follower who do Koresh emulate who be Koresh 's teacher Koresh do to his follower what Satan do to Eve do not Koresh kill his followersr do not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well do not the cult follower believe Koresh even though they know the real Christ be bear in Bethlehem do not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite know that it would cause her death God hold they all responsible deceiver and the rebeller none of they have an excuse;3

171;the primary problem in human nature be a fragmentation of be human be in a state of tension a tension of opposite good and evil be the most thought provoke polarity that come to mind the Bible provide we with many example of the fragmentation of be the war opposite within we be a product of man 's rebellion against God which be describe so vividly in the page of the scripture Man be create with the order to become a god those be the word of St. Basil in the fourth century what he be try to say be that God create man to be a partaker of the divine nature in the Eastern Orthodox Church this be call theosis or deification one can also say that man be create to be whole i.e. spirit soul and body operate in unison the story of Adam and Eve be a picture of the archetypal human before obtain moral consciousness Theirs be a harmonious relationship with each other the world and the Creator that innocent harmony be shatter when they disobey God their natural wholeness fall apart into two seemingly irreconcilable half immediately guilt and fear be manifest in their life they become bound to hardship toil and suffering this be symbolize in their exile from the paradisiac state the beast in the jungle do not possess moral consciousness if it be to receive this self awareness the knowledge of good and evil its paradisiac state would also be destroy be it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the day of his existence on earth or be the gaining of self awareness carefully stage by God who do not desire that his masterpiece mankind be a blissful idiot God must have know that for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value he must pass through a confrontation with the opposite there be no other way to achieve union with God Jesus Christ be the answer to the problem of the war polarity he be the perfectly integrate individual reconcile the opposite and make it possible for we to be integrate i.e. to become God not in his essence but in his energy the opposite be the christian problem the Apostle Paul describe it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15 24 and he follow with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25;3
172;I have n't see any speculation about it but the Salyut KB Design Bureau be plan a new LH   LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg Geostationary go from 2600 kg gal launcher version to 6000 kg this scheme be compete with the Energia M last year and I have n't hear which win except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB be work on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia M. so the early result be Energia M win but this be a guess nothing be very clear in Russia i 'm sure if Salyut KB get fund from someone they will continue their development the Centaur for the Altas be about 3 meter dia and the Proton be 4 so that be a good fit for their exist upper stage the block d which set inside a shround just under 4 meter dia I do n't know about launch load etc but since the Centaur survive Titan launch which be probably bad than the Proton those Titan srb 's probably shake thing up pretty good it seem feasible EXCEPT the Centaur be a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which be not available now proton be assemble and transport horizontially do anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolt to a Proton horizontally and then take down the rail road track and erect on the pad they would also need LOX and LH facility add to the Proton pad unless the new Proton second stage be actually build and of course any Centaur support system and facility no doubt import from the US at great cost these system may viloate US law so there be political problem to solve in addition to the instability in the cis you mention;2

187;I plan to post a summary of response to this as soon as I have work code which I will also include the intersection of 3 plane method look good but my implementation base on a short article in Graphics Gems I does n't work I may be misinterpret of course I have avoid the simultaneous solution of the plane equation in favor of dot and cross product but the former may actually be well in either case a matrix determinant need to be compute implicitly in the solution of linear equation to get the plane I be take the midpoint of the line from say P1 to P2 and set the normal as the normalize vector from P1 to P2 these just plug into the formula in Graphics Gems however the result center point be only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test point for different test my matrix   vector math be very rusty but it look like I need to verify the formula or use the simultaneous equation solution which will require bring in another routine I do n't have but should be easy to find another method be to first find the center of the circle define by 2 set of 3 point and intersect the normal from there this would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecision would make the line not intersect supposedly 3 plane have to intersect in a unique point if they be not parallel Ed thank to all who answer so far;1

190;how about this description an object that be at one time both a Euclidean square and a euclidean circle I hold that no object satisfy this description could exist the description be inconsistent and hence describe an object that could not exist now suppose someone point to a bicycle and say that object be at one time both a Euclidean square and a euclidean circle this do not mean that the bicycle do not exist it measn that the description be incorrectly apply the atheist say the description of God that I have be present with be contradictory and hence describe something that can not exist now your position so far as I can gather be that God exist but the description atheist have be present with be simply bad description of it this be roughly analogous to someone who have never see a bicycle and when they ask for a description from people who claim to have see one be tell that it be a euclidean circle square can they be blame for doubt rather strongly that this bicycle exist at all no kidding sincerely Ray Ingles inglesengin.umich.edu;0

217;ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE be gravity this paper both describe how heavenly bodys can be stationary ether suck structure and why we observe orbital motion Ether the theoretical propogation medium of electro magnetic wave be conclude not to exist base on the result of the Michelson Moreley experiment conduct a century ago I propose that those conclusion be flaw base on the fact that the experiment be design to look for a flow parallel to the earth 's surface not perpindicular due to the prevail assumption that the earth travel through the ether as a ball through the wind the reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought could have ramification of biblical proportion through out the world REMEMBER Einstien say Imagination be great than knowledge 1 I dream like this ether base reality the ether be like a fluid out of phase with our reality creation start as a lattice place into the ether give a spin the lattice both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it convert it distil localize mass time and energy non spinning lattice   dark matter the earth is n't exactly spinning around the sun picture an image of a galaxy- we have n't any video of they spin picture we be stationary and the sun 's image be drag across the sky by the spin ether field picture an onion each layer of which be spin a little fast than the next a thread shoot at the inner kernel would be stretch diagonally sideways its head be in a fast shell than its tail until it finally intersect the ground of the inner kernel its direction vector be straight down but its foot print be a line not a point   sunrise sunset   the moon is n't exactly orbit we it be a parasite non self spin sustain be drag in the earth 's ether field which be itself in the sun 's much more powerful field our season be the wobble of earth 's axis like a top slow down the orbit of the earth around the sun be all of the stars image be drag around by the sun 's ether feild the earth moon and sun be about the same size and distance apart its just that the time between they vary greatly because the path be not the same the moon 's lattice in the ether be like stick a fork in a plate of spaghetti and give the plate a half turn the sun 's lattice have so much spin that its like the fork have get the whole plate of noodle wound up the piece of light go to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at the end the piece of light go to the sun have to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it get there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as earth 's shadow upon it and at other time totally eclipse the sun look in the sky except for your Knowledge would you guess that they be about the same size just because they look about the same size o E o o o s E   M    or M     S the full moon quarter moon etc be the difference between rate of ether spin what we be look at be a rotate turntable view of the moon only half of which be face the sun I 've see a half moon within about 120 degree of sky of the sun during the day try and draw that earth shadow its only the moon 's image which appear to orbit we no matter where it be the light part be the part face the sun and the dark part be the half face away from the sun even when it appear to be behind we Light Years between galaxy be a misnomer the distance be close to zero as time and matter be characteristic of this phase of reality which dissipate outward with each layer of the onion define edge   0 ether spin what we be see could be essentially happen now the piece of light may have experience many year but the trip could be very quick our time to time travel or warp space I might consider learn to de spin myself phase out my mass good luck try to design a propulsion system to drag around a space time locality its like try to move a balloon by shoot a squirt gun from within to find out about all of this I recommend study history i 'd look in the book of life or holy grail etc brain wave just might carry decipherable datum i 'd start look on some part of the spectra say to be unusable due to all the background noise 4   billion human i 'd totally isolate myself record I think DOG backwards and learn to read what I get Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium next conclude that my thought be record on a non time bind medium the ether and that it be I who move forward in time I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which i 'd start look for as flow opposite magnetism

compromise his control he entice recruit by send they his vision say that there be immortality at the end of the road for only twelve soul kill or be kill the amount of control he could exert be finite though as at every change he make a void would appear in our reality the universe one day end 100 meter from we it seem odd but we could n't remember how else it should be then some of the twelve be no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stop just beyond his fingertip he step through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he have create I make a few

218;ah now here be the core question let I suggest a scenario we will grant that a God exist and use revelation to communicate with human Said revelation take the form paraphrase from your own word this infinitely powerful deity grab some poor schmuck make he take dictation and then hide away for a few hundred years now there exist a human who have not personally experience a revelation this person observe that not only do these revelation seem to contain element that contradict rather strongly aspect of the observed world which be all this person have ever see but there be many mutually contradictory claim of revelation now base on this can this person be blame for conclude absent a personal revelation of their own that there be almost certainly nothing to this revelation thing Absent this well language and absent observation in support of the claim of revelation can one be blame for doubt the whole thing here be what I be drive at I have think a long time about this I have come to the honest conclusion that if there be a deity it be nothing like the one propose by any religion that I be familiar with now if there do happen to be say a Christian God will I be hold accountable for such an honest mistake sincerely Ray Ingles inglesengin.umich.edu;0

229;I assume you be post to encourage comment how much history have Tony Campello read not much it seem it be good to hear that there be a few reasonable Christians about if only those christian scientist would take note in Australia there be a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientist who believe that every single event in the bible be exactly true and that there be a rational explanation for it all that can be justify by use the law of physics for example there be a few chap who be try to prove that the age of the universe be 6000 year old and that the error in conventional calculation be the result of the fact that the speed light have be rapidly decay over the year and this have not be account for or of course that he never exist and the bible be a story and be never intend to become a manifesto for a billion people do Tony follow that one up million of people have die for a lie this point be difficult to substantiate since it be not well define a great many religious argument work in that way but consider the many aztec warrior who sacrifice themselves to their god in the belief that this act would bring they victory of the spanish invader the list be endless the Aztecs lose BTW that be perfectly reasonable but it be not ground for I or anyone to become a christian more to the point it do not add weight to the claim that Jesus be the real thing have you ever see a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany more to the point do Tony mention this one could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his many colleague fool or illogical man their support of Hitler be base I presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principle obviously my argument be invalid if Tony think that Hitler be sane Hmmm I do n't think his argument warrant the use of a Therefore this be unfortunately what alot of religious discussion I have have with people result in quote the bible the only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible be to treat the story as some sort of metaphorical representation of the message that the author be try to present if someone try to interpret part of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sort of shit Tony 's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the event describe in the bible take place but to convince someone who think the bible be total fiction that Jesus be real by quote the book be totally pointless for example in mathematic you can not say a be equal to b because a be equal to b. that would possibly explain why there have so many people be kill in religious war and why there be hundred of different version all claim to be correct it I think if you post this part to alt.religion you would get more flame than here I have never really understand why the emotional sentiment of a stranger should be of interest to other people someone famous say that there two evil in life polititian and church one rule by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead if I be press I could probably find the exact quotation;0

235;I think the passage you 're look for be the following Matthew 5:17 think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets- I have come not to abolish they but to fulfil they Matthew 5:18 for truly I say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all be accomplish Matthew 5:19 whoever then relax one of the least of these commandment and teach man so shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven- but he who do they and teach they shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven Matthew 5:20 for I tell you unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribe and Pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there be several problem with this the most serious be that the Law be regard by Jews at the time and now as bind on Jews but not on Gentiles there be rule that be bind on all human being the so call noachic law but they be quite minimal the issue that the Church have to face after Jesus death be what to do about gentile who want to follow Christ the decision not to impose the Law on they did n't say that the Law be abolish it simply acknowledge that fact that it did n't apply to Gentiles this be a simple answer which I think just about everyone can agree to a discussion of the issue in more or less these term be record in act 15 however there 's more involved in order to get a full picture of the role of the Law we have to come to grip with Paul 's apparent rejection of the Law and how that relate to Jesus commendation of the Law at least as I read Paul he say that the Law serve a purpose that have be in a certain sense supercede again this issue is n't one of the abolition of the Law in the middle of his discussion Paul note that he might be understand this way and assure we that that be not what he intend to say rather he see the Law as primarily be present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it be an impossible standard and one that have be supercede by Christ Paul 's comment be not the world 's clear here and not everyone agree with my reading but the interesting thing to notice be that even this radical position do not entail an abolition of the Law it still remain as an uncompromise standard from which not an iota or dot may be remove for its purpose of convict of sin it 's important that it not be relax however for Christians it be not the end ultimately we live in faith not Law while the theoretical category they use be rather different in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quote passage from Mat 5 should be take in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus show we how he interpret the Law the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact that 's not Jesus approach Jesus interpretation emphasize the intent of the Law and stay away from the ceremonial detail indeed he be well know for take a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that Mat 5:17 20 need to be take in the context of 1st Cent jewish discussion Jesus accuse his opponent of care about give a tenth of even the most minor herb but neglect the thing that really matter justice mercy and faith and care about how cup and plate be clean but not about the fact that inside the people who use they be full of extortion and rapacity Mat 23:23 25 this and the discussion later in Mat 5 suggest that Jesus have a very specific view of the Law in mind and that when he talk about maintain the Law in its full strength he be think of these aspect of it Paul 's conclusion be similar while he talk about the Law be supercede all of the specific example he give involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the Sabbath he be quite concerned about maintain moral standard the net result of this be that when Paul talk about the Law be supercede and Jesus talk about the Law be maintain I believe they be talk about different aspect of the Law Paul be embroil in argument about circumcision as be natural in letter respond to specific situation he 's look at the aspect of the Law that be currently cause trouble the Law as specifically jewish ceremony he certainly do not intend to abolish divine standard of conduct on the other hand when Jesus commend the Law he seem to be talk the Law in its broad implication for moral and human relationship and deemphasize those aspect that be later to give Paul so much trouble;3

285;in the April edition of one Small Step for a Space Activist Allen Sherzer   Tim Kyger write another problem be what be call wraps or sometimes the center tax when work for a large program like Freedom or Shuttle be perform at a NASA center the center skim off a portion which go into what amount to a slush fund this money be use to fund work the center manager want to fund this sum be estimate to be over a third of the fund allocate think about that of the   30 billion cost of Freedom fully   10 billion wo n't be spend on anything have anything to do with Space Stations now maybe that   10 billion be wisely spend and maybe it was n't but the work do with it should stand on its own merit not distort the cost of other project Congress have no idea of the existense of these wraps- Congress have never hear the term center tax they look at the Station they be get and the price they be pay and note that it does n't add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money be go for something else my dear friend your mix fact and fiction here a couple of week ago when I first read this in your posting I talk with one of the cost expert here in Space Station at Headquarters   if you wonder why I did n't post a response immediately I do have a real job I 'm suppose to be do here at Headquarters   dig up old 20 khz datum   look into Sherzer   Kyger claim rate pretty low on the totem pole of priority also I spend last weekend in Kansas City at the National Science Teachers Association conference extoll the virtue of SSF to 15,000 science teacher   first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap do exist if I recall the number correctly the total tax for the SSF program for this fiscal year be around   40 million this be compute by add up the wp-1 WP-2 and wp-4 center taxes with the SSF budget for this fiscal year at   2.2 billion my calculater say the tax percentage be 042.2   1.8 over the life of the SSF program use your figure of   30 billion for the cost of SSF a tax at a 1.8 rate come to   540 million this be alot less than   10 billion but I will concede it 's still an appreciable amount of pocket change I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 13 could be close to the actual rate the tax be only charge on fund that be spend at the center kind of like McDonalds at some state where you do have to pay sale tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you do n't if you get it take out for example at wp-4 the vast bulk of the fund we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract and be   not   subject to the center tax I do n't have the number in front of I but i 'd guess at least 95 of the WP-4 fund go to Rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of 13 but it 's only apply to fund spend at the center and not to the prime contract this lead to the obvious question what be the government do with SSF fund that do n't go to the prime contractor i.e. ok WP-4 get a slice of the   30 billion pie a big portion of this slice go to Rocketdyne what happen to the balance of the fund which are n't eat up by the center tax at wp-4 we call these fund we spend in house support development fund as they be support the development work do by Rocketdyne we have use these fund to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed have a real life solar array field leave over from solar cell research research a few year back with lead acid car battery to simulate the Nickel Hydrogen battery on SSF DC switchgear DC DC converter unit and simulate load datum from the testbed be use in a recent change evaluation involve concern about the stability of the power system we have also use the support development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen battery which be on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana as a side point 6 of the battery cell on test recently hit the four year life test milestone 38 cell have complete 18,552 to 23,405 cycle the on orbit battery go through 5,840 cycle per year as a final example my home division at Lewis use the support development fund to purchase personal computer and work station for perform system analysis like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculation use a Monte Carlo simulation set up a database with information on weight of the power system element finally the money raise by the tax do not all go into a slush fund at Lewis the director do control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter Most of the tax however go to fund the general service at the Center like the library the central computer service division the Contractor who remove the snow etc thus it be rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget does n't go for SSF activity to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library fund use to support SSF which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year be billable to SSF would you base it on the person hour SSF employee spend read av week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that go to support the library who know maybe SSF overpay on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare;2

415;no there be two problem here 1 Peter die two millenia ago the original letter he write have long since decay into dust if he be alive today and I could question he then this might lend credibility to your claim but probably not much because after all I 've hear people claim with all sincerity that they 've speak with Elvis recently but after his death Peter 's writing be transcribe by monk for century and I find it hard to believe that one of they somewhere did n't decide to change the wording of something to make it in his opinion a little easy to understand 2 even if Peter do witness the miracle of Jesus two millenia ago that does n't mean that your deity be what the Bible say it be God might just be Satan try to convince everyone that he be a nice guy or even that your deity be still alive and active in the world today nice try but it just is n't enough to convince I especially since your wild claim about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way i 've observe the world to work please find something more compelling;3

421;actually the reboost will probably be do last so that there be a fuel reserve during the eva in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that but yes you 've get the idea the reboost be do by take the whole shuttle up somebody have to build that thruster module- it be not an off the shelf item nor be it a trivial piece of hardware since it have to include attitude control HST 's own be not strong enough to compensate for thing like thruster imbalance guidance there be no provision to feed gyro datum from HST 's own gyro to an external device and separation you do n't want it leave attach afterward if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid be open again you also get to worry about whether the lid be go to open after the reboost be do and HST be inaccessible to the shuttle the lid stay close for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thruster and the like the original plan be to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost the omv be plan to be a sort of small space tug well suit to precisely this sort of job unfortunately it be cost a lot to develop and the list of definitely know application be relatively short so it get cancel;2

424;  reply to frankD012S658.uucp Frank o'dwyer   from a Dictionary of Philosophy by Anthony Flew objectivism the belief that there be certain moral truth that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone think or desire for instance No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering might be think of as a plausible example even in a world of sadist who all reject it the contention remain true just as 5   7   12 remain correct even if there be no one leave to count the problem for the objectivist be to determine the status of moral truth and the method by which they can be establish if we accept that such judgement be not report of what be but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they can not be prove by any fact about the nature of the world nor can they be analytic since this would involve lack of action guide content- One ought always to do the right thing be plainly true in virtue of the vord involve but it be unhelpful as a practical guide to action see analytic and synthetic at this point the objectivist may talk of self evident truths but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self evidence be in the mind of the beholder if not what be leave of the claim that some moral judgement be true the subjectivist may well feel that all that remain be that there be some moral judgement with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion be he suggest not to know something to be true but to have preference regard human activity;0

426;hi everyone because no one have touch the problem I post last week I guess my question be not so clear now i 'd like to describe it in detail the offset of an ellipse be the locus of the center of a circle which roll on the ellipse in other word the distance between the ellipse and its offset be same everywhere this problem come from the geometric measurement when a probe be use the tip of the probe be a ball and the computer just output the position of the ball 's center be the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse the answer be no ironically DMIS an American Indutrial Standard say it be ellipse so almost all the software which be implement on the base of DMIS be wrong the software be also sell internationaly Imagine how many people have or will suffer from this bug how many qualified part with ellipse be   will be discard and most importantly how many defective part with ellipse be   will be use I be employ as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem I spend two month on analysis of this problem and six month on programming now my solution nonlinear be not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset it be very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I use be not analytical I be now wonder if I did n't touch the base and make thing complicated please give I a hint I know you may argue this be not a CG problem you be right it be not however so many people involve in the problem sphere from 4 poit why not an ellipse and why not its offset please post here and let the other share our interest I get several email from our netter they say they need the summary of the answer;1

431;no matter how absurd it be to suggest that a common moral system create by mankind be absolute it be not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system create by mankind be sensible in fact for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code it must be interpret by mankind and a workable moral system create for everyday use the jewish Talmud be the result of century of biblical scholar analyse every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it the Children of Israel be give a very strict set of Moral civil Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this be clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society for a Christian the situation be no well it seem to I that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God be that which be contain in the Bible which we can see from the diverse opinion in the christian newsgroup be not clear there may well be an absolute morality define by the Judeo christian God for mankind to follow but it seem that we only have a subset simply because the concept be write down by man this lead to the problem of define morality for our society if we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpret in many different way as an example consider the immolation of heretic in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allow a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice if we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modify to suit society with all the danger that this imply alternatively we could take the basis of the judeo christian morality and interpret   extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suit the society we live in and enable the people to live Righteously as many christian and non christian philosopher have do whatever the drive force behind the definition of morality for our society I think the important aspect be the result David on religion;3

does n't support the Nick Szabo Vision of the Future to which you must subscribe Fred we 're all support what each of we think should be do to some degree if you have a problem with what Nick think should be do address it instead of just complain about his do so you really do n't get what the complaints be about do you   not incredibly clear explanation of complaint something between feeling regard Nick 's method and judgment about his meaning   T F     Fred 's issue   1- Nick 's alleged trashing of other     I only get it when you stop trash and make your point patently instead of allegorically that be my point all along Fred I see we be deal with a problem in a conflict of interpretation not least of which be your belief that only you can adequately judge what be and be not debate suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point why do n't you take a poll Fred if you want some psuedo objective point of view and as usual you defend your insult with he start it yeah I take some of his research and call it my own but he start it so what if I steal his car he steal my lawnmower first besides that I think it be still open to interpretation whether Nick actually do start it so your defense besides be lame and contradict the first part of the sentence in which it occur may not even apply anyway your defense remind I of the guy that break the borrow tool I never borrow it I already give it back and it be break when you give it to I make up yer mind Fred first I try to address what I think you mean for which I be reward with a denial of sort and a smart remark then I point out that I be not clear what you do mean rather than risk your childish ire wrongly interpret you a second time and i 'm stupid for it I just ca n't win can I Fred You 've get a great point here somewhere it 's just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinion you never actually get around to make it     fred issue   2- Nick 's allege meaning     too bad the plan only exist in your mind instead of Nick 's or you would have a really good point instead you have provide a good reason to ignore your insult since they be base on incorrect interpretation that you have make about other forgive I for give your insult more meaning than they ever should have have my reading of what Nick actually say be that people are n't require in all part of all space process so your take issue with his opinion regard people in the space program I read as People be require in all part of all space process so help I out here Fred since I 'm so patently stupid do you read Nick wrong or be you go to eat your terminal now if the latter I sure hope it 's one of those Cheeto and string model that all the computer mag have be rave about the point be   i   be not stupid because of   your   incorrect assumption i 'd only be stupid if I insult you for having make it but alas that be your job Fred and finally your style be confusing since you try to make two point simultaneously with an allegory   insult sadly one point address a plan that only exist in your mind and the other take issue with behavior that you do as much as anyone no no I finally get it you do n't like the plan that Nick 's post make you imagine and you do n't like Nick 's obnoxious behavior even though it 's no bad than your own thank for take the time with someone as dense as myself of course Socrates how could it be otherwise who care who come on the net first if you do consider that you see I come on after a brief haitus before which I be on for about 2 year if you have see I on the net first you 'd remember when Nick and I go down exactly the same road regard rude unneccesary behavior It 's just amazing to I that you continue to take issue with behavior that be no bad than your own Let 's see here my complaint about your obnoxious behavior be hypocritical while your flame against people you decide be flamer is n't and my complaint about your name calling be immature while your name call is n't yeah right maybe if you call I some more name I might see it well Fred net.ghod wannabe naturally Fred you 've correctly interpret my motivation when yours be impossible to judge from your action as your insulting of people that try prove I did n't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what I really want be to impress everyone I only put my complaint with your behavior on private mail not because it belong there but because I think you be such a jerk that you 'd bring it back to the Net

474;stop hold it you have a few problem here official history say that the first accusation of homosexuality in the SA come from OUTSIDE of the Nazi party long before the Nazis ever come to power so this objection be a red herring even if establish history be wrong on this point moreover none of the history I 've read ever make mention of Hitler or anyone else ever use homosexuality as a pretext for purge Roehm a point I see reiterate be that Hitler and the party cover up these accusation if you be go to accuse official history of be a fabrication you should at least get your fact right the pretext for purge Roehm be that he be plan to use the SA in a coup against Hitler nowhere be there mention of use allegation of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge nor as a justification afterwards it be possible that the history i 've read have not mention this but I doubt it would it be in Hitler 's good interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man be a homosexual anyway as I say before it be always possible that I have miss reference to the Nazis make use of charge of homosexuality against the SA after the night of the long knife but this do not prove that they be false even the Nazis could tell the truth when it be to their advantage in any case this do not deal with accusation of homosexuality in the SA during the 1920 's ah yes I forget this be be post to alt.conspiracy I can smell the paranoia from here since the Nazis never officially charge Roehm with homosexuality at least not accord to what I 've read i 'd like to know what taint evidence you be talk about since the accusation be make by person outside of the Nazi party long before it come to power and those accusation be common knowledge to journalist and other in Germany in the 1920 's and 30 's just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in time and plant tainted evidence how exactly do one doctor newspaper which be circulate around the world without the discrepancy be obvious what actual incidence of nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about and what about the testimony of people who be involve in these matter some of whom be not nazi and what be the point of make a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it since the point here seem to be to discredit establish history then the burden of proof fall on the revisionist the revisionist have well do their homework before make accusation otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nut this be just about the   only   thing we agree on I suspect that the notion that there might have be bad people Roehm and his SA buddy who be homosexual must disturb some people the feeling seem to be that if a nasty individual be accuse of homosexuality that this must be an attempt to bash homosexual this fear often justify be what lie behind this distrust of official history or so it seem to I but this be not a good justification for trash accept account of this subject if you really think that historian be so incompetent why do n't you write they and ask where they get their source on this subject if you ca n't tell from their footnote I 'm a graduate student in history write to professor and track down source be old hat but my time be limited and this be not my specialty and neither you nor anyone else have say anything that would cast one shred of doubt on exist evidence I 'm not go to waste my time try to debunk someone 's paranoia do the research yourself give that you already consider all evidence taint what on earth would constitute concrete particular and since when have concrete particular be consider shrewd guess I suggest that those who do not trust popular historian Irving et al historian write for a popular audience do not as a rule provide copious footnote should try instead read academic historian who usually provide footnote to all their source in immmense detail this be the place to start look assume that one really want to know the truth I 'll bet the folk on alt.pagan be tired of this subject already my apology we seem to have go off on a bit of a tangent I forget which god be responsible for keep string within appropriate newsgroup subject boundary;3

the child in all of we LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN a room 14 foot by 8 foot contain the base lunar layout the wall be use for mural of distant moon mountain star field and a view of the earth the floor be the simulated lunar surface a global call for contribution be hereby make for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale model of lunar colony element scenery and machine let the LTM1 initial design have 3 tele operate machinelet 1 an SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land- 2 a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area- and 3 a moon train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface each machinelet have a small tv camera utilize a CCD tv chip mount on it a personal computer digitize the image include reduce picture content and do data compression to allow for minimal image to be send to the operator for control purpose and also return control signal the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model train with tv camera build in be almost off the shelf item and control electronic for start and stop a train be minimal the user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 second depend on the speed of their datum link to LTM1 next an SSTO scale model with a CCD tv chip will be suspend from a servo motor operate wire frame mount on the ceiling allow for the SSTO to be control by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank model will be modify to be CCD tv chip equip bulldozerlet the entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operator worldwide to receive minimal image while actually operate model for landing and takeoff travel and do work the entire system be base on commercially available item and part that can be easily obtain except for the interface electronic which be well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware   software developer by take a graphically orient communication program Dmodem and add a tele operation screen and control the necessary user interface can be provide in under 80 man hour plan of action the Diaspar Virtual Reality Network have agree to sponsor this project by provide a host computer network and internet access to that network Diaspar be provide the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model Diaspar have in stock the electronic tank that can be modify and one CCD tv chip Diaspar also agree to provide rail stock for the lunar train model Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communication package and modify it for control of the machine let an initial ground break with miniature shovel will be perform for a live photo session and news conference on April 30 1993 the initial model will be put in place a time lapse record will be start for historical purpose it be not expect that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declare open for additional building operation and experiment a photographer will be present and the photograph take will be convert to .gif image for distribution world wide to major online network and bbs 's a press release will be issue call for contribution of idea time talent material and scale model for the simulated lunar colony a contest for new design and technique for work on the moon will then be announce university will be invite to participate the goal be to find instructor who wish to have class participation in various aspect of the lunar colony model field trip to LTM1 can be arrange and at that time the result of the class work will be add to the model contributor will then be able to tele operate any contribute machine let once they return to their campus a monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issue both electronically online and via conventional mean to the medium any major new tele operate equipment addition will be mark with an invitation to the television news medium have a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be control by people all over the world science fiction writer will be invite to issue challenge to engineering and human factor student at university to build and operate the tele operate equipment to perform lunar task use counter weight and pulley system 16 gravity may be simulate to some extent to try various traction challenge the long term goal be create world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony LTM1 have the potential of be a long term global EduTainment method for space activity and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject area not limit to space EduTainment all of this facilitate the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who be ready for the leap to the star conclusion EduTainment be the blending of education and entertainment anyone who have ever enjoy see miniature will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purpose by create a tele operate model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also a method of try new idea that require real not virtual skill and open a new method for put people 's mind in space moonlighter illuminate the path of knowledge about space and lunar

520;this be one of my favorite fallacious point against atheism i.e. the belief that you ca n't deny anything that you ca n't prove does n't exist this be easily nail by show that an infinite number of being be conceivable but not observe to exist do this mean that we would have to believe in all of they accord to the above poster we must believe in object or being that have n't be prove not to exist so why stop at God there could be a huge number of being identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial difference say one be miss a finger one have blond hair and they all live on other planet so we ca n't see they the reason no one but atheist bring this up be that none of these christian have a vested interest in these unknown being with the exception of God how do they shoot themselves in the foot there be a big difference here Stalin did n't say that he stand for a particular moral position i.e. against murder and terrorism etc and then do the opposite like the religious movement he be at least an honest killer this be not a support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint say that atheism support murder and violence just because one man be a tyrant and an atheist be just bad logic look at all the russians that help Stalin that were n't atheist do n't they contradict your point besides your point assume that his atheism be relevant to his murder people this be just the common assumption that atheist ca n't value life as much as theist which you did n't support ah and here be another point you did n't get out of the FAQ an atheist does n't have to hold the positive view that god does n't exist he   she may just have the non existence of the positive belief Here be the example strong atheism I believe god do not exist a positive belief weak atheism I do n't believe in a god a negative belief these be not the same some one that have never think of the idea of god in their whole life be technically an atheist but not the kind that you be call unreasonable or let 's look at it this way in set suppose that a give person have a huge set of idea that I will represent as capital letter and these people then either believe that these idea exist as real object or not so if S   santa then E(S no be the person not believe in santa but still have the idea of santa but notice that even e   no be itself another idea this mean you have lot of case christian a e(a)yes B E(B)no G E(G)yes where G   god atheist strong a E(A .G E(G)no atheist weak A E i.e. no g at all in the set agnostic A G E(G   indeterminate E Nietzsche once say that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this be that humanity always prefer no or yes to a maybe because indecision be not a useful survival trait evolution have drill it in we to take position even false one;0

535;the follow be my thought on a meeting that I Hugh Kelso and Bob Lilly have with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays we be there to discuss SSTO and commercial space this be how it go after receive a packet contain a presentation on the benifit of SSTO I call and try to schedule a meeting with our local Senator D Patty Murray Washington State I start ask for an hour and when I hear the gasp on the end of the phone I quickly back off to 12 an hour later in that conversation I learn that a standard appointment be 15 minute we get the standard bozo treatment that be we be call back by an aide who schedule a meeting with we in order to determine that we be not bozo and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to make sure that it be appropriate to take the senator time with that material well I get allocate 12 hour with Sen. Murrays aide and we end up talk to he for 45 minute with we end the meeting and he still listen we cover a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit be DCX specific Most of it be a single stage reusable vehicle primer there be another woman there who take copius quantity of note on every topic that we bring up but with Murray be new we want to entrench ourselves as non corporate aligned I.E. not speak for boeing local citizen interenteste in space so we spend a lot of time cover the benifit of low cost access to LEO Solar power satellite be a big focus here so we hit they as become feasible with low cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that we hit the tourism angle and I leave a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper with side note be that everyone who go into space and see the atmosphere become more of an environmentalist esp after see the smog over L.A. we hit on the benifit of study bone decalcification which be more pronounce in space and say that that have POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis we hit the education whereby kid get enthuse by space but as they get old and find out that they have not a hop in hell of actually get there they go on to other field with low cost to orbit the chance they might get there someday would provide great incentive to hit the hard class need we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle we hit the low cost of satellite launch gps navigation personal communicator tellecommunication new service etc job provide in those sector job provide build the thing balance of trade improvement etc we mention that skypix would benifit from low launch cost we leave the paper on what technology need to be invest in in order to make this even easy to do and he ask question on this point we end by tell she that we want she to be aware that effort be proceed in this area and that we want to make sure that the result from these effort be not lose much like condor or majellan and most importantly we ask that she help fund further effort along the line of lower the cost to LEO in the middle we also give a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act and the guy file it separately he be very interested in it he ask some question about it and seem like he want to jump on it and contact some of the people involve with it so something may actually happen immediatly there the last two thing we do be to make sure that they know that we know a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they could feel free to call we any time with question and if we did n't know the answer that we would see to it that they question get to people who really do know the answer then finally we ask for an appointment with the senator herself he say that we would get on the list and he also say that know she this would be something that she would be very interested in although they do have a time problem get she schedule since she be only in the state 1 week out of 6 these day all in all we feel like we do a pretty good job;2

555;OpenGL be a graphic programming library and as such be a great portable interface for the development of interactive 3d graphic application it be not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor SGI be commit to high performance interactive graphic system and software tool so OpenGL mean that you can port easily from SGI to other platform there be no guarantee that your performance would be comparable if your sale representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against we which you should carry up to your local SGI sale management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sale come from satisfied customer so give it a shot as one of the previous post state the Personal IRIS be introduce in 1988 and grow to include the 4D20 4d25 4d30 and 4d35 as clock rate speed up over time as a rule of thumb SGI platform live for about 4 5 year this be true of the motorola base 3000 series 85-'89 the PI 88-'93 the Professional Series the early 4d 's 86-'90 the Power Series parallel system 88-'93 Individual cpu subsystem run at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 year new graphic architecture at the high end GT VGX RealityEngine be release every 18 month to 2 year these be the fact of life if we look at these machine they become almost archaic after four year and we have to come out with a new platform like Indigo Onyx Challenge which have high bus bandwidth fast cpu fast graphic and I   O and large disk capacity if we do n't we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meet your current need and make economic sense today you ca n't wait to buy but if you need a guarantee upgrade path for the machine ask the Sales Rep for one in writing if it 's feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade path have specific program associate with they such as the Performance Protection Program for old R3000 base Power Series multiprocessing system which allow purchaser of those system to obtain a guarantee upgrade price for move to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400 base 64 bit multiprocessor system if that 's happen it 's becausing of misunderstanding or mis communication not because SGI be directly attempt to annoy our customer base Most SGI customer be onesy twosey type but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we be about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post state if we pre announced and the schedule slip we would mess up our potential customer schedule when they be count on the availability of the new system on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investor and the financial analyst who watch we most carefully to see if we be meet our commitment five year be an awfully long time in computer year new processor technology be arrive every 1 2 year make a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generation behind the time the competitive nature of the market be demand that rate of development so if your timing be really 5 year between purchase you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there be some reality about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keep customer happy be the most important so do n't give up we know it Josh;1

557;dear Rob sometimes I do come across condesending and I be sorry I come across that way at time thank you for the reproach I really do appreciate it I 'll try to get well Rob at the same time I have also learn that some people respond to the gentle approach while other respond only at a harsh rebuke Brian K. so far only respond to the latter and I be glad he respond at all in both case of approach my intention be to be love I be make no excuse for myself if I be come across condesending I apologize for that Rob sometimes Brian K. come across as honest I know this but Brian K. vasillate back and forth one post look honest- the next be an excuse now he want I to explain the universe in 50 word or less I think Brian Kendig be really try but he be too comfortable with his set of excuse I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself if he really want to know he will ask question and stop assert irrelevant excuse which have nothing to do with my God I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decision without be sidetrack with the temptation to mock God from my perspective Rob when I look at Brian Kendig I see a man stand out in the middle of a highway off into the distance I see a Mack truck head right for he but Brian K. be face away from the oncoming truck he does n't see it Here 's be how I see the dialog I Brian K please step aside before you get run over BK there be no truck I turn around at look BK no I look you will be healthy if you do take a look at the oncoming truck BK no explain to I why truck exist I turn around or you will run over BK no I wo n't because I like hiking and tomorrow be Tuesday I you blind fool why do you choose ignorance you have nothing to lose if you look but if do not look you will certainly lose your life I do not want to see you squash all over the road BK it be my life to lose I rather not look besides a truck run over I will not harm I and by the way I really have an open mind so be my motivation to belittle Brian or to love Brian the good I know how I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out because million if not billion of people fall into the same category perhaps all people fall have fall into this category at one time in their life I have I can now see the truck behind Brian my hope be that Brian will look and will see the ramification of the truck come towards he my hope be that Brian will want to step out of the way my fear though be that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway where he will certainly get run over but if he so choose he so choose and there be nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind for it be his choice but at this very moment Brian has n't get even that far he be still at the point where he do not want to look sure he move his eyeball to appease I but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture so far he be satisfied with his glimpse of the mountain off in the distance;3

561;   I strongly suggest that you look up a book call the BIBLE the QURAN and    science by Maurice Baucaille a french surgeon it be not comprehensive    but it be well research I imagine your library have it or can get it    for you through interlibrary loan    I shall try to get hold of it when I have time to read of course    in short Dr Baucaille begin investigate the Bible because of pre-    ceive scientific inaccuracy and inconsistency he assume that    some of the problem may have be cause by poor translation in by-    go day so he read what he could find in Hebrew Greek Aramaic    what he find be that the problem did n't go away they get bad    then he decide to see if other religion have the same problem    so he pick up the Holy Qur'an in French and find similar prob-    lem but not as many so he apply the same logoic as he have    with the Bible he learn to read it in Arabic the problem he    have find with the french version go away in Arabic he be unable    to find a wealth of scientific statement in the Holy Qur'an but    what he do find make sense with modern understanding so he    investigate the Traditions the hadith to see what they have to    say about science they be fill with science problems- after    all they be contemporary narrative from a time which have by    pour standard a primitive world view his conclusion be that    while he be impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an have to    say about science be accurate he be far more impressed that the    Holy Qur'an do not contain the same rampant error evidence in    the Traditions how would a man of 7th Century Arabia have know    what   not to include   in the Holy Qur'an assume he have author    it    so in short the writer or writer of Quran decide to stay away from science if you do not open your mouth then you do n't put you foot into your mouth either but then if you say Quran do not talk much about science then one can not make claim like Bobby do that you have great science in Quran basically I want to say that   none   of the religious text be suppose to be scientific treatise so I be just request the theist to stop make such wild claim Vinayak vinayak dutt e mail vdpmayo.edu standard disclaimer apply;0

Bailey- old persian inscription ignore the avestan term for priest athravan Vedic athravan even if this be perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablet of Persepolis Gershevitch 1964 the term magu have be present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history- the Pahlavi term mogh mard and mobad represent its continuation the latter in particular derive from an old form magupati head of the Magi during the Sasanid period third to seventh century CE which see the formation of a hierarchically organize church the title mobadan mobad the high priest of high priest come to be use to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy the Magi practice consanguineous marriage or khvaetvadatha Av.- Pahl khwedodah they also perform a characteristic funeral rite the exposure of the corpse to animal and vulture to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it the corpse be not suppose to decompose lest it be contaminate by the demon of putrefaction this practice later become typical of the entire zoroastrian community and lead to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India stone tower know as dakhmas be build especially for this rite during the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse be in vogue only among the magi- the Persians generally sprinkle the corpse with wax then bury it the practice be widespread however among the people of Central Asia the Magi be the technician of and expert on worship it be impossible to offer sacrifice without the presence of a Magus during the performance of a ritual sacrifice the Magus sing of the theogony the Magi be possibly the custodian of a tradition of sacred poetry but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various part of the Avesta and be call upon to interpret dream and to divine the future the Magi be also know for the practice of kill harmful or ahrimanical animal khrafstra such as snake and ant they dress in the median style wear pant tunic and coat with sleeve they wear a characteristic head covering of feel Gr tiara with strip on the side that could be use to cover the nose and mouth during ritual to avoid contaminate consecrate object with their breath Boyce 1982 the color of these cap in conformity with a tradition that be probably of indo european origin accord to Georges Dumezil be that of the priesthood white in all likelihood during the Achaemenid period the Magi be not in possession of a well define body of doctrine and it be probable that they gradually adopt Zoroastrianism- they be most likely a clergy consist of professional priest who be not tie to a rigid orthodoxy but be naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism nonetheless they must have be jealous guardian of the patrimony of zorastrian tradition by virtue of this they be the educator of the royal prince the wise of they be responsible for teach the prince the magic of Zarathushtra son of Horomazes and thus the cult of the god Magi who excel in other virtue be entrust with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just courageous and master of himself during the Achaemenid period the Magi maintain a position of great influence although they be certainly subordinate to the emperor despite several dramatic event such as the massacre they suffer after the death of Gaumata the Magian in which accord to Herodotus who call himself Smerdis the Persians kill a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation the Magi nevertheless manage to maintain their influence at court in Media in Persia and in the various region of the empire where they be station as a consequence of the persian civilian and military administration no priesthood of antiquity be more famous than that of the Magi they be renowne as follower of Zarathushtra zoroaster)- as the teacher of some of the great greek thinker Pythagoras Democritus Plato)- as the wise man who arrive guide by a star at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem- and as the propagator of a cult of the sun in India but they be also know as the Chaldeans the priesthood of Babylon know for its occultism- this be perhaps the reason that the term mago have a pejorative sense in Greek like go expert in the magic art Bidez and Cumont 1938 indeed the Chaldeans be expert in all type of magical art especially astrology and have a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge to understand the reason for such various and sometimes discordant view it be necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so call western Magi who be later hellenize in the Achaemenid period both must have be at least in part Zoroastrian but the western Magi those of the iranian diaspora in Asia Minor Syria Mesopotamia and Armenia who come in contact with diverse religious tradition must have soon or later and in vary degree be influence by syncretic concept the Greeks be familiar with both kind of Magi and depend on their vary concern would emphasize one or the other aspect of they classical historian and geographer include Herodotus and Strabo document their custom while the philosopher dwell above all on their doctrine dualism belief in the hereafter magian cosmology and cosmogony and their theology and eschatology those source most interested in the doctrine of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus in do so they be repeat what the Magi themselves say from the Median and Achaemenid period when they adopt Zoroastrianism at that time they embrace Zarathushtra as one of their own and place themselves under his venerable name Zoroastrianism have already undergo several profound transformation in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and be already adapt those element of the archaic religion that refuse to die it have be say quite often in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the zoroastrian tradition that the Vendidad from vi daevo data the law abjure daivas part of the Avesta should be attribute to they this collection of text from various period be primarily concerned with purificatory rule and practice nonetheless the hypothesis be hardly plausible since the first chapter of the Vendidad a list of sixteen land create by Ahura Mazda the supreme god of Zoroastrianism but contaminate by an attack by Ahriman Pahl.- Gathic Avestan Angra Mainyu the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering do not mention western Iran Persia or Media the land of Ragha mention in the text can not be Median Raghiana furthermore it have be note Gershevitch 1964 that if the author have be Magi the absence of any reference to western iranian institution include their own priesthood would be very strange the Magi be above all the mean by which the zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have be transmit to we from the second half of the first millennium BCE on this have be their principal merit we can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that iranian dualism assume know to we especially from greek source and in part from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth century CE accord to this formulation the two pole of the dualism be no long as in the Gathas Spenta Mainyu beneficent spirit and Angra Mainyu hostile spirit but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu Gershevitch 1964   see Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu   this trans- formation be of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and be most likely determine by the contact of the Magi with the mesopotamian religious world in this new dualism which be that later know to the Greeks Aristotle Eudemus of Rhodes Theopompus and other we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism to which we give the name Zurvanism   see Zurvanism   thank to their adherence to Zoroastrianism the Magi play an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra 's treaching as well as in the definition of the new form that these would assume historically their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also help the diffusion of zoroastrian idea in the community of the iranian diaspora the Greeks begin to study their doctrine and to take an interest in they Xanthus of Lydia Hermodorus Aristotle Theopompus Hermippus Dinon even write treatise on the persian religion of which only the title and a few fragment have survive in the hellenistic period the Magi be see as a secular school of wisdom and writing on magic astrology and alchemy be lend the authority of such prestigious name as Zarathushtra Ostanes and Hystaspes form an abundant apocryphal literature Bidez and Cumont 1938 later still eschatology and apocalyptic be a fertile meeting ground for iranian and judeo christian religion as can be see in the famous   oracle of Hystaspes   a work whose iranian root be undeniable and which most likely date from the beginning of the christian era probably the second century CE Widengren 1968 the zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future Saoshyant be the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the   Gospel of Matthew   2:1 12   see Saoshyant   the Sasanid period see the Magi once again play a determine role in the religious history of Iran concerned to win back the western Magi de Menasce 1956 and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran the priest of iranian sanctuary in Media and Persia be able to establish a true state church strongly hierarchical and endow with an orthodoxy base on

577;actually jon that be quite true christian people have cause objective morality to look very relative after all that be the point of the original question in this thread i.e. can we toss out Christianity because it be so obviously inconsistent with its own principle if you will bear with I I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian 's viewpoint if God exist and be the creator of mankind as the Bible claim then he have a pretty well define concept of what make people tick physically emotionally etc GOD have an objective morality for we that be to say he have no trouble understand what be good for or detrimental to the creature he create tGalatians 2:10 for we   mankind   be his workmanship create in tchrist Jesus for good work   a morality   which God prepare tbeforehand   a well define design   that we might walk in they however contrary to what many people assume include the Pharasees of the Bible God 's morality can not be completely codify in a list of rule and regulation to some extent every activity of a person 's life create a new situation to which morality must be apply there never could be enough volume to codify god 's objective morality for we throughout history mankind have try to reduce morality to a list of rule objectivity if you please in the Old Testament we have both principle and specific rule by the time of Jesus most of the principle be obscure by the emphasis man have place on the rule volume of additional rule have be make to try to codify the application of the principle we   mankind   were n't comfortable with the subjectivity of principle tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explain the difference tbetween the Law and the principle of the Law for example in tverses 21 22 you have hear that the ancient be tell t'you shall not commit murder and whoever commit murder shall tbe liable to the court but I say to you that everyone who be tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court the objective morality of God get blur by our inept interpretation of it we   Christians   have make our big error when we have allow any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intend for we if we   christian   would stay committed to seek God 's will instead of try to prove we already have it all figure out we might do a well job of allow other to find God 's objective morality for themselves if Jesus be who he say he be   be and that be the fundamental question then he be objective morality;3

637;rather than decide which book you want to buy you need to decide which programming interface you want to use then buy the appropriate book I write an article for the X Resource which discuss the difference between PHIGS and PEXlib it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon but here be a brief summary phigs be a graphic api which be design to be portable to many device Most implementation support the x Window System and take advantage of a 3d extension to x call PEX PEXlib be a slightly low level api which be design to efficiently support the pex extension to X. some advantage of use PEXlib integrate with Xlib Xt Motif etc well than phigs provide immediate mode capability be free of policy pex support phigs but be currently be extend to support feature not find in PHIGS like texture mapping anti aliasing PEXlib will give you access to all of these feature some advantage of use PHIGS support for multiple device not just x base one support for archiving metafile hardcopy output PHIGS have predefine input device to make input easy phigs can handle exposure event and resize for you PHIGS can help you with colormap selection   creation if you 're work strictly in x and do n't care about thing like archive I would go with PEXlib either way you will find that both API 's have a lot in common;1

641;there be an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today 's LA Times Thursday April 15 1993 p. D1 I think I 'd post it to stir up some flame war I mean reason debate let I preface it by say that I largely agree that the Space Age in the romantic sense of several decade ago be over and that project like the space station miss the point at this time reading for example What 's New the weekly physics update we get here on the net it 's clear that the romance of the day lie in the ever more fine grain manipulation of matter by which I include biotechnology condense matter physics with its spinoff in computer hardware and elsewhere and the amazing thing people be do with individual atom these day to a large extent I think the romance some people still have with space be a matter of nostalgia I feel sure that someday we or more precisely our mind child will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out)- but I think that   man   space exploration be not what be exciting about what we can do   now   anyway let I quote some of this article but not all SPACE AGE GLORY FADES from VIEW Micheal Schrage writer consultant and research associate at MIT at 35 America 's Space Age wo n't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis the reason be that the Space Age be already dead the technology no long define our time and the public have grow weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investment that yield minimal psychic or economic reward space exploration have mutate from a central focuse of America 's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue Speace be not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our technology infrastructure discussion or even our defense conversion policy to be sure America should continue to invest in satellite technology for telecommunication and remote sensing cheap deep space probe would be nice too but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation be now dead before the change in administration it would have be foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age the Bush White House aggressively support the space program and propose spending well over   30 billion to build space station Freedom alone even as he propose budget cut in other science and technology domain Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman be an outspoken public champion of big ticket space expenditure the reality that much of the civilian space program from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station be poorly conceive and unimpressively implement do not seem to matter much political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism not a coherent vision or cost effective sensibility determine multibillion dollar space budget indeed with few notable exception such as Voyager the post apollo era be the story of the gold plate porkification of space exploration with program and promise that deliver less for more and more while the Clinton Administration have keep on the highly regard Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration it seem clear that space exploration be not be position as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America 's technological prowess the space station budget have rightly be slash Space be virtually ignore when the Administration champion its competitiveness agenda;2

645;at the cost of repudiate the FAQ I think too much be make of the strong vs weak atheism issue although in the context of alt.atheism where we 're continually attack on the basis that strong atheist believe in the non existence of god I think the separation be a valid one to cover my arse what I 'm try to say be that there be an infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism I wish whereas I   logically   can only support the weak atheist position in effect I be a strong atheist and wish I could be a mathematical one to justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence present in favour of any of the god under scrutiny be faulty if I read the FAQ correctly no argument for the existence of god generic as represent by mainstream theologian have ever be find to be unassailable to I this be adequate evidence that the   realgod   be undefinable or at least no definition have yet be find to be watertight which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god I 'm a little fuzzy on the edge though so opinion be welcome but perhaps we should change the thread subject;0

677;hi everyone I think that some people may be interested in my VR software on these group         announce the release of Multiverse-1.0.2         multiverse be a multi user non immersive X Windows base virtual Reality system primarily focus on entertainment   research feature Client Server base model use Berkeley Sockets no limit to the number of user apart from performance generic client customizable server Hierachical Objects allow attachment of camera and light source multiple light source ambient point and spot object can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attach Functionality Client the client be build around a fast render loop basically it change thing when tell to by the server and then render an image from the user 's viewpoint it also provide the server with information about the user 's action which can then be communicate to other client and therefore to other user the client be design to be generic in other word you do n't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this mean that resource can be spend on enhance the client software rather than adapt it the adaptation as will be explain in a moment occur in the server this release of the client software support the following functionality o Hierarchical Objects with associated addressing o Multiple Light Sources and Types Ambient Point and Spot o User Interface Panels o Colour Polygonal render with Phong Shading optional wireframe for tfaster frame rate o Mouse and Keyboard Input some people may be disappoint that this software does n't support the PowerGlove as an input device this be not because it ca n't but because I do n't have one this will however be one of the first enhancement server(s this be where customization can take place the follow basic support be provide in this release for potential world server developer o Transparent Client Management o Client Message Handling this may not sound like much but it take away the headache of accept and terminate client and receive message from they the application writer can work with the assumption that thing be happen locally thing get more interesting in the object extension functionality this be what be provide to allow you to animate your object o Server Selectable Extension Installation what this mean be that you can decide which object have extend functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialiser you want o Event Handler Registration when you develop extension for an object you basically write callback function for the event that you want the object to respond to current event support INIT MOVE CHANGE COLLIDE   TERMINATE o Collision Detection Registration if you want your object to respond to collision event just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activate when a collision occur this software be keep separate from the worldserver application because the application developer want to build a library of extended object from which to choose the follow be all you need to make a World Server application o provide an initworld function this be where you choose what object extension will be support plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this be where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobject function this be where you load the world .wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this be where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this be where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the object move by call a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrun the client That be all there be to it and to prove it here be the line count for the three world server i 've provide generic 81 line dactyl 270 line more complicated collision detection due to the stair will probably be improve with future version dogfight 72 line Location this software be locate at the follow site ftp.u.washington.edu Directory pub   virtual world File multiverse-1.0.2.tar Z Futures Client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i.e. Z Buffering or similar Gouraud shade o HMD support o etc etc Server o Physical Modelling gravity friction etc o Enhanced Object Management   Interaction o etc etc both o Improved Comms I hope this provide people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software unfortunately it come with practically zero documentation and I 'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectify I hope people enjoy this software and that it be useful in our exploration of the virtual Universe I 've certainly find fascinating develop it and I would   LOVE   to add support for the PowerGlove and an HMD finally one major disclaimer this be totally amateur code by that I mean there be no support for this code other than what I out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide I can not be hold responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it AT your OWN risk Disclaimer over of course if you love it I would like to here from you and anyone with POSITIVE contribution   criticism be also encourage to contact I anyone who hate it   dev   null

682;hudson If all morality be relative- big hairy deal as I say you appear to be the only person say that all morality be relative Most people I know do hold some absolute in their moral system I    personally    believe that the dignity of the individual and the right of free will are absolute I recognize that there be some moral system around which do n't accept this- I reject they as dangerous and anti social nazism some form of communism fundamentalist xtianity no that be not a slam but for the most part almost every moral system agree on these two point me hudson generally Christians believe in a Creator Creation distinction other religion believe in one big whole I do n't accept yor premise too bad I know I 'm right so I get to enforce my view upon you whether you like my premise or not and since you ca n't prove otherwise there is n't even an intellectual basis for your resistance to accept my viewpoint hudson I do n't think so once morality become relative it degenerate I be saye that reasoning that it be generally evil to hurt other people be bad though I do n't think it be sufficient well then answer I this you seem to be oppose to moral relativism as you call it because it have the capacity to degenerate obviously then you would advocate a nonrelative absolute moral system whose absolutist moral system do we choose how do we come to this decision what about people who disagree with the choose moral system hudson But if morality be consider to be relative and this rule is n't base on anything but be just an arbitrary rule people might abandon it Fine I can agree with most of what you type here however just because morality get base on something nonrelative do not mean that we have to pick your xtianity as its base;3

728;bill I have take the time to explain that biblical scholar consider the Josephus reference to be an early christian insert by biblical scholar I mean an expert who in the course of his or her research be willing to let the chip fall where they may this exclude literalist who may otherwise be define as biblical apologist they find what they want to find they be not trustworthy by scholarly standard and other why an insert read it I have a number of time the passage be glaringly out of context and Josephus a superb writer have no such problem elsewhere in his work the passage have   nothing   to do with the subject matter in which it lie it suddenly appear and then just as quickly disappear until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community be wrong about the Josephus insert your proof be meaningless and it should not be repeat here What 's more even if Josephus happen to be legitimate it would prove nothing scholar speak of the weight of evidence far more independent evidence would be require to validate your claim until forthcoming your belief be base on faith That 's OK but you exceed your right when you pass faith off as fact as for the gospel there be parallel but there be also glare inconsistency and contradiction Should n't a perfect canon be perfect Should n't there be absolutely no room for debate I suggest you read   Gospel Fictions   by Randel Helms and   the Unauthorized Version   by Robin Fox for Herb Huston no know kinship or familial relationship but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry the fact that there be inconsistency gap and contradiction do not deny your position on the other hand neither do the gospel prove your faith independent evidence be necessary and I know of none which we have already discuss and so far you have not provide any until then its faith moreover you have commit a fundamental error in logic you have attempt to prove your claim with that which you want to prove its no different than say I be right because I say so your logic be full of circle it remind I a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly the assembly define five fundamental this be where fundamentalist come from of orthodox Protestant Christianity to wit 1 Jesus perform miracle 2 Jesus be bear of a virgin 3 Jesus be bodily resurrect 4 Jesus crucifixion atone for human sin and here be the clincher 5 the bible be the inerrant word of God presbyterian construe inerrant broadly as spritually inerrant fundamentalist take the first four as literally true and then validate they with a literally inerrant bible which contain the first four and which be the only thing know to contain the first four smoke and mirror and wand and hand wave if ever there be its faith Bill you do n't have any more or well truth than anyone else whatever work for you just do n't foist it on other regard;3

746;in   lsjc8cINNmc1saltillo.cs.utexas.edu   turpincs.utexas.edu Russell Turpin I regard love as no more or less benign than any other Christian do you be merely express approval of the consequence I find therein which say more about our politic and cultural trapping than about my or any religion Love be a highly ambiguous word of which Christians can write both the gentle word Paul use of it in 1 Corinthians in a passage that even the conservative will quote at you and the word of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn Love be the unfamiliar name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame this be in any case rather to the side of what I be attempt to raise in my note as will become more evident below blechhh I think you be misread I rather seriously though give my principle that one CANNOT force one 's own notion of sin on another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism Russel Turpin and other believer and unbeliever alike be under no threat of my legislate my own understanding of christian love you misread I can do and have repeatedly do a complete bill of accusation against the inquisition by exhibit in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it have do to human being in the first place and to respect for let alone love of God in near succession please go back to my quote word above the possibility that always exist be that I or to revert to proper time sequence my predecessor over the last several century could persuade Christian B of my case that the inquisition   do   indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love I must also note that the majority of Christians have be so persuade by christian argumentation as well as by secular   both christian and non christian   prohibition what Mr. Turpin allude to be a tricky point ta I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involve t in the Inquisition tB. the Inquisitor respond that Mother Church must however t painful this   seem   discipline her child for their t own good in this case the salvation of their soul or t if the torture heretic will not recant than by bad example t deter other from the same loss of soul ta I point out that this justification of a failure in love t depend on a highly speculative construal of text and of t philosophical assertion that be quite undemonstrable tb burn I at the stake my rhetoric have fail but the point I be make be sustain what be go on here have a   lot   to do with cultural baggage in this case the baggage include a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief that an accuse person must prove innocence and that testimony be most believable if take under torture the elimination of inqisitorial practice in those place where it   have   be eliminate or at least greatly reduce have very little if anything to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B. Mr. Turpin be point out that if I be a versus the Grand Inquisitor 's b then my persuasion be not very likely to work I know this- and in what- ever personal agony I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney so one possibility fail in this case as it will fail in may other at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it properly should not if it entail mistaken assumption I share with the Inquisitor and that be potentially an even more troubling case in that many of the victim of inquisition will have accept that they be in fact sinful in such random case as they may actually have be guilty of charge bring against they the point be that the persuasion break down when the party do not share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and give the main thrust of the inquisition against heresy it be   bind   to break down in precisely the bad case the conservative I do n't think that be the right word BTW will take refuge in what I attribute to B above that he be justify in cause harm because he   think   that work to a great good but this be a violent and extravagant refusal to follow the gospel as if one 's theory about sin entitle one to cast aside Jesus word on deal with sinner cf Matthew 5:39ff I be a radical Christian   only   in that I take the gospel seriously well the whole   point   of make these the base commandment be that they   are n't   reducible to rule a set of rule be a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for act such thing can be very helpful to individual or society but not if they be use   instead   of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's action the Great Commandment be more than anything else a call to act   as if you be God and accept ultimate responsibility   in your every action a demand that I like most would rather   not   hear but it keep pop up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it be more important that I be open to try this than succeed at it conservative may twist this act as if you be God to mean lay down rule for other people and be as nasty to they as possible if they do n't keep your rule they be so insistent and obvious about this that they have convince a lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy be how God act that after all be the standard accusation against God by the atheist here and elsewhere that the conservative have confuse their manipulative hoop jump notion of coerce other people with the Nature of God be almost the entire content of standard american atheism and I quite agree with it on this point and different body of Christians have from the beginning urge   different   ethical system or in some case none as a result it be bizarre to identify any one of these system however popular or infamous with Christianity Christianity do not have a TORAH it do not have a qu'ran specifically christian scripture have very little if anything in the way of commandment so little that the Christians who desperately   want   commandment go mine for they with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their effort the one single thing in the gospel which Jesus specifically give as a commandment to we be love one another ti will be expand on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson t that I hope to get to in a day or so it be quite true that t some Christians infer lots of commandment from the NT- i 'll t point out what have to be go on in these inference and why t there be a huge amount of cultural baggage involve   you be quite right that this be goo if one be look for an ethical system but why should anyone be look for an ethical system since our society be eager to hand we one or more no matter what we do it may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical system in which case I will profer the   agapate allelou   once again I think you be beg the question why do n't I and the myriad of other Christians like I tell you something about Christianity   nor be this very new in Christianity you might want to look up the origin and fundamental doctrine of the Quakers from the 17th century onwards and they be not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that be congenial to my case  ;3

Welbon   for many atheist the lack of belief in god be secondary to an epistemological consideration what do we accept as a reliable way of know there be no known valid logical argument for the existence of god nor be there any empirical evidence that they exist Most philosopher and theologian agree that the idea of a god be one that must be accept on faith Faith be belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence it be a reliable way of know there be probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof even when we agree to take someone else word on faith we just mean that having find this person to be reliable in the past we judge he likely to be a reliable source now if we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about god the difference between the atheist and the theist be fundamentally then one of whether or not faith be hold to be a reliable way of know rather than as some agnostic poster would have it whether one faith be in god or no god the theist believe that faith be an acceptable basis for a belief in god even if he reject faith as reliable at other time for example in his work as a scientist the atheist believe that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge Agnosticism seem to I a less defensible position than theism or atheism unless one be a sceptic in regard to all other knowledge without evidence why should we believe in god rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny I would also like to point out as other have that the atheist does n't require absolute knowledge of the lack of god I do n't believe that there be any such thing as absolute knowledge atheism be the good and simplest theory to fit the lack of fact and so should be hold until contrary evidence be find;0
769;I 've be to three talk in the last month which might be of interest i 've transcribe some of my note below since my note take ability be by no mean infallible please assume that all factual error be mine Permission be grant to copy this without restriction Michael Sternberg Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT be invite to speak at an informal lunch hold by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois ACDIS be an organization on campus that deal with Arms Control Disarmament and International Security rimsat be consider an appropriate topic because the company be use russian launcher and satellite I think it also help that his daughter be a grad student in the International Relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently begin when Matt Neilson go to Tonga to visit a friend while he be there he somehow end up visit the king who happen to be a big tv fan Matt buy the King a satellite dish which the king think be really nifty since Tonga have a gnp of about   70 million his Majesty ask if there be any way to make money off this Matt think there probably be so at his suggestion Tonga apply for 31 geosynchronous satellite slot while this is n't entirely off the wall it be very unusual see as Tonga be a tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 be a lot of slot the whole thing be debate in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard who be apparently a respected space lawyer write several opinion support Tonga 's case eventually Tonga end up with 7 slot range from 70 e to 170 e slot be designate by the longitude over which they reside accord to Sternberg four of these from 130 e to 142 E be the good in the world because they be excellently place for communication between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim rimsat be form to use these slot it be officially form in Nevis as a tax haven they try for a few year to raise fund in the west however to fill 7 slot with western satellite launch on western launcher would have cost approximately   2 billion It 's not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of use russian hardware they begin negotiate with Glavkosmos for hardware Mr Sternberg describe operate in Moscow in such harsh term that I do n't think i 'll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comfort he be not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper document and license that indicate they be the only one who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually RIMSAT arrange a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellite at a cost of   150 million however Glavkosmos lose favor after the coup Sternberg say that this be because they be basically a bunch of KGB operative who go to trade show and pick up lot of brochure since Glavkosmos be out of power he have to renegotiate the deal with the new authority he again describe life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable term eventually he work out a deal and on Dec 4 1992 he meet with Koptev who head the russian space program to sign the deal Koptev insist on a few concession before sign and accord to Sternberg he arrange these new rule to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT the next step be to meet with the builder of the hardware NPO Applied Mechanics NPO PM to use their acronym this organization be locate in Siberia ca n't figure out how to spell the town I need an atlas and have build about 1500 vehicle since the dawn of the space age Sternberg comment that siberians be very different from Musovites they be hard worker honest people who team up to get thing do very much like midwesterner at this point there be some comment from the audience that agree with his opinion on both siberian and midwesterner Sternberg have lot of good thing to say about NPO PM his company be apparently lookng for   100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partner it apparently cost the Russians about   4 million to build a satellite that would sell for   50 million in the west if you want to give they specification they 'll build you a satellite for the particular satellite that RIMSAT will be use cost run about   378,000 per transponder year this compare to   810,000 t   y in the U.S. they can sell their time for about   1.1 million compare to   2.6 million in the U.S. rimsat will launch their satellite on Protons to get the good price they buy in bulk they have the right to twelve launch so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address the first launch be schedule for October and they be get one use satellite from the Russians which be be move into place now tidbit   Sternberg say this kind of thing have to be do by entrepreneur not big business because big business be just like what they have over there except that we have well paper both in the bathroom and in the copier   russian launch be self insure the promise to replace a failed launch within 9 month   major investor in RIMSAT include Russell 2020 which be a huge retirement fund organization Cellsat which be a big telecom business in southeast Asia and a fund operate by some of the big name in U.S aerospace which he say be sort of an insurance policy for they if this really take off   he downplay the instabilite in the ex USSR say that we be worried partly because we are n't use to see Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith Italy get a new government every two week but we do n't worry because we 're use to it he predict that once we get use to see what really go on in Russia we wo n't worry about their stability as much   Part of the problem with cooperative venture be the problem of transfer money the central bank have a policy of take hard currency payment put 25 in their coffer and replace the rest with the equivalent value in ruble to get around this RIMSAT pay their hard currency into an austrian bank account NPO PM then pay their contractor with foreign currency so that the only the contractor get swindle by the government   one of the big problem RIMSAT have have be stonewall by the western satellite industry however Intelsat recently buy three of the same type of satellite which be rather reassuring   the big worry most people have about russian satellite be the primitive technology and short lifetime the old Gorizont Horizon satellite have a lifetime of about 5 year while the more modern Express satellite compare well with western technology and last about 8 year while this be much short than 15 year for western satellite Sternberg downplay the difference at these price they can afford to launch new one in addition short lifetime mean that they can replace their equipment with new technology so they will be able to compete well than old out of date hardware;2

798;lot of stuff about the Nicene Creed delete which can be read in the original basenote I will also leave it up to other LDS netter to take Mr. Weiss to task on use Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive word on what the LDS Church teach as doctrine hopefully the LDS netter will be amiable in their explanation since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss have state on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspire I say no good because it can not be prove through discussion or debate as to whether or not the author of the Creed be inspire I leave you it will be some time before I post again with the following thought author by Eugene England Professor of English at Brigham Young University Mr. England write the following as part of a book review section in this People 's magazine Spring 1993 edition I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a mormon-- or human family until we can get over labeling and reject each other with term like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative Christian or non christian Hal 8 when we be tempt to draw a circle around a set of belief and tradition and style and call it american then exclude those who do n't fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central define characteristic of a good American might be one who does n't draw exclusive circle that the sure way of exclude ourselves from the central american ideal be by exclude other and when we be tempt to draw a circle around Mormon or Christian to decide who be orthodox and who is n't by how much they agree with we it might be well to consider that the central pillar of Christ 's orthodoxy be our ability to love unconditionally those who be different and include they in our family I recently spend some time in a christian bookstore in California the service be excellent the clerk and customer all smile neat and well scrub and there be the expect wholesome offering of scriptural commentary sentimental fiction and collection of evangelistic sermon but I be dismay to find how much shelf space be give to attack other often viciously whether the political left our modern american culture or other religion a whole section be devoted to Cults and the Occult and as you might expect Mormonism be right there under the same rubric and indictment often by the same author as Satanism and I find I could either rent or buy in English or Spanish copy of the God Makers that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous anti mormon film that use exaclty the same technique and even accusation of the Nazi film that scapegoate Jews in the 1930s it seem to I one major indication that a person be a genuine convert to Christ and his redemptive love be his lack of paranoia and anxiety Perfect love casteth out fear I John 4:18 I have always be pleased that the LDS Church have not engage in attack on other faith though I find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormon to engage in the same kind of stereotype and scapegoating and even threat of coercive action as the religious right wing have launch this year against the political left and american cultural and religious style they do n't like it be a fearful irony that in so do mormon take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attack mormon people who would if they have power forcefully restrict mormons right along with those of other they believe to be evil the above sermon be address to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People 's magazine but would certainly apply to all of we who rely on the mercy and grace of Jesus Christ to bring we back into his arm even though the LDS Church claim devine authority to exercise the principle of the restore gospel as in the day of Christ the Church do not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the Church I for one do not wish to be label Christian if those who profess themselves as Christians attack my belief because they be intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret biblical scripture of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream Christianity would give it once again be in the majority do not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective voice be loud That be really all the critic of the LDS Church have to stand on in term of the kind of biblical interpretation use as proof to counter the LDS Church interpretation use someone else biased research of truth and non truth whose to say what the mixture be as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit be not be fair to anyone least of all themselves let we simply agree to disagree and share belief through adult discussion and conversation thereby uplift everyone;3

820;you misrepresent I Selim the hard evidence for my statement about his lack of objectivity be present quite clearly in the book Orientalism by Edward Said Edward Said by the way be a Christian not a Muslim regard Bernard Lewis he be a Zionist give he a political motive for his give misrepresentation and half truth about Islam Read Orientalism by Edward Said see the evidence for yourself in fact I may post some of it here if it is n't too long I have n't read Lewis 's article so I ca n't comment directly upon it and have only speak about his writing   in general   so far that his political motive make he a biased writer on Islam his anti islamic polemic as I understand it be often quite subtle and be often base on tell half truth again read Orientalism by Edward Said I be   not   ask you to take what I say on trust in fact I be urge you not to do so but to get this book it be a well know book and check the evidence out for   yourself   if slavery be   in reality   as oppose to in the practice of some Muslims oppose by Islam then use slave for sexual purpose be necessarily oppose too I understand your point of view Selim I think rather it be   us   who be not get through to   you   some of the point you repeat above I have already answer before regard woman I have make posting after post on this subject show that Islam be not anti woman etc however have you be completely ignore my posting or just miss they I just reposte a very good one under the title Islam and Women reposte from soc.religion.islam if this have already disappear from your site then please email I tell I so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article IMHO your understanding of the issue of woman in Islam be sadly deficient regard slave   my   post on slavery the second one I make which be a repost of an article I write early last year be base completely on the Qur'an and contain numerous qur'anic verse and hadith to support its point of view our approach be different you be argue from a historical standpoint and I be argue directly from the teaching of the Qur'an and hadith now just because people say they be Muslims and perform a particular action do that automatically mean that their action be part of Islam even if it be oppose by the Qur'an and Sunnah no of course not let I give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the Qur'an prohibit drink now if a person say I be a Muslim and then proceed to drink a bottle of beer do this now mean that Islam teach that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point you be judge Islam here on capitalist term capitalism be an ideology base largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth this assumption be in opposition to islamic teaching to say Islam be bad because it be not capitalist be pretty unthinking Islam do not pretend to be capitalist and do not try to be capitalist this do not mean that Islam do not support a free market for it do in general but there be other part of capitalism which be oppose to Islam as I understand it one can postulate numerous reason for this your theory be that it be because Islam be not secularist and capitalist etc etc Selim I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your view if you think as you obviously do that Islam    lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world be very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world be the foremost in the science so to say that Islam be for example anti education be completely absurd you try to blame this situation on Islam history show that your conclusion be false and that instead there must be other reason for this situation well Selim your viewpoint on woman in Islam make I question the extent of your knowledge of Islam I really think you be not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims be follow the Qur'an or not the islamic world be at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in your theory it be by follow the qur'an that Muslims be backwards in education Selim it be   your   thesis that be anti historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradict your theory you have certainly not show this- you have merely state it so far it seem to I that your view on Islam be anti education be quite contrary to history that you be so convinced of your view make I wonder just how objectively you be try to look at all of this I think Selim you should consider take your own advice here too Selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of Islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to Muslims be leader of science till about 1400 or so I think yet you say that your viewpoint be base on history Selim if I remember right you say in one of your early post that you be an apostate from Islam I think you should slow down and start think clearly about the issue and start   read   some of our posting about Islam rather than ignore they as you so obviously have;0

840;I 've be to three talk in the last month which might be of interest i 've transcribe some of my note below since my note take ability be by no mean infallible please assume that all factual error be mine Permission be grant to copy this without restriction note for newbie the Delta Clipper project be gear towards produce a single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle the DC x vehicle be a 13 scale vehicle design to test some of the concept invovle in SSTO it be currently undergo test the DC Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reach orbit it have not yet be fund on April 6th Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas give a talk entitle Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions here at the University of Illinois Mr Nelson 's job involve use software to simulate trajectory and determine the optimal trajectory within give requirement although he be not directly involve with the Delta Clipper project he have spend time with they recently use his software for their application he thus use the DC Y project for most of his example while I do n't think the detail of implicit trajectory simulation be of much interest to the reader I hope they are n't I fall asleep during that part I think that many of you will be interested in some of the detail glean from the example the first example give be the maximization of payload for a polar orbit the main restriction be that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs I assume that this be drive by passenger constraint rather than hardware constraint but I do not verify that the Delta Clipper Y version have 8 engine 4 booster and 4 sustainer the booster which have a low isp be shut down in mid flight thus one critical question be when to shut they down Mr Nelson show the follow plot of acceleration vs time        3 g         as ascii graph go this be actually fairly     t good the big difference be that the line 2 g     make by the   should be curve which be    concave up the datum be only approximate as    the graph was n't up for very long 1 g      0 g     100 sec 400 sec as mention before a critical constraint be that g level must be keep below 3 initially all eight engine be start as the vehicle burn fuel the accelleration increase as it get close to 3 g the booster engine be throtle back however they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon make more sense to cut they off altogether this cause the dip in accelleration at about 100 second eventually the remain sustainer engine bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely the engine cutoff do not acutally occur in orbit the trajectory be aim for an altitude slightly high than the 100 nm desire and the last vestige of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lower the final altitude to that desire question from the audience paraphrase Q would it make sense to shut down the booster engine in pair rather than all at once a very perceptive Worth consider they have not yet do the simulation shut down all four be part of the problem as give Q so what be the final payload for this trajectory a ca n't tell we Read Aviation Leak he also apparently have a good propulsion example but be tell not to use it my question do anyone know if this security be due to SDIO protect national security or MD protect their own interest the second example be reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver the big constraint in this one be aerodynamic heating and the parameter they be try to maximize be crossrange he show graph of heating use two different model to show that both be very similar and I think we be suppose to assume that this mean they be very accurate the end result be that for a polar orbit landing at KSC the DC Y would have about 30 degree of crossrange and would start it 's reentry profile about 60 degree south latitude I would have ask about the landing maneuver but he did n't know about that aspect of the flight profile;2
841;what be the main advantage of this method I have see it describe and the algiorithm seem a little bit long I develop my own method which require that the point be in a counter clockwise order and return whether you be look at the back or the front similar to the plane eqn method it use few calculation however basically it be several comparison the only disadvantage I see be that it must be do after the transformation from view coordinate to coordinate to display on the screen which mean that a little more calculation isneede beforehand my method basically figure out whether the point that will appear on the screen be clockwise or counterclockwise when look at the back of something the point occur in an opposite direction from the front so merely by figure out which way the point go you can tell whether you be look at the back or front of a 2d polygon have anyone hear of this method before it be so simple I doubt I be the first to think of it Libertarian atheist semi anarchal Techno Rat;1

for people who do n't have direct access to encoder or FTP but do have access to a scanner we accept disk in either Mac or IBM compatible format if possible please submit image file as GIF or JPG if you ca n't we can convert from most format we 'd just rather not have to at sender request we can also fill disk with as much OTIS as they can stand even if you do n't have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an SASE or   2.50 for disk postage and packing to get a slab o OTIS as of 042193 we 're at about 18 megabyte of file and grow email I for current archive size and directory DISTRIBUTION the image distribute by the OTIS project may be distribute freely on the condition that the original filename be keep and that it be not alter in any way save to convert from one image format to another in fact we encourage file to be distribute to local bulletin board and such if you could please transport the appropriate text file along with the image it would also be nice if you 'd send I a note when you do post image from OTIS to your local bbs I just want to keep track of they so participant can have some idea how widespread their stuff be It 's the purpose of OTIS to get

875;Most of the key issue in the 284 line post to which I be follow up be deal with in the following post I make on talk.abortion yesterday modify to correct the next to last paragraph message ID   nyikos.734890344milo.math.scarolina.edu   reference   nyikos.734360987milo.math.scarolina.edu    nyikos.734640769milo.math.scarolina.edu    1993apr13.122356.3612cbnewsj.cb.att.com   Dean do not he call they the Great Commission but this be not descriptive of Jesus 's word in Matt 10:15 Matt 10:14 Jerusalem Bible translation tand if anyone do not welcome you or listen to what you have tto say as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust tfrom your foot Matt 10:15 tI tell you solemnly on the day of Judgment it will not tgo as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with tthat town   the above be a good description of Kaflowitz who keep harp on   shake the dust off the foot but ignore what Christ say next    the highlighted word refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively and Dean counter actually this comment of your 's be a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you be since I specifically acknowledge the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word in fact it be the combination of the two statement I be address and not just the one and for you to characterize that as ignore the instruction to spread the word be a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you be of course Matt 10:15   quote above   make no mention of instruction to spread the word all these quote btw be from Message ID   1993apr13.121624.3400cbnewsj.cb.att.com   and I claim it correctly because my question go do you too measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value and care not a whit for such mundane thing as truth and falsehood and the close Dean come to an answer be Peter Peter Peter you 're just so stupid pretentious dull and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport be all there be of course this do not answer my question which have to do with post in GENERAL and not my post in particular surely even Dean know this yet he brazenly assert otherwise reinforce his claim with an insult so I now restore the answer to your question that you delete if you 're still unable to figure it out ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you it really does n't take much sophistication to understand on top of which I doubt that the answer be at all representative of Dean 's true frame of mind the insult you have see quote thus far be but a small sample of the stream that ooze out of Dean 's mind throughout the 284 line post from which these quote be take one wonder whether Dean 's mind be so warped as to find sport in all this he even dredge up a falsified account of event that transpire early on another thread you make an ass of yourself by claim that it tttt be in the tradition of Lent to make public announcement of   the sin of other individual   False I say it be the tradition to recall and atone for one 's sin that I make public announcement of the sin of other --sins BTW that be a matter of public record document in the post of others-- be a different matter many of the individual involve be so nearly amoral that they do not see as sin what morally upright people see as sin so I point some of they out and I expressly set up a whole thread your turn to let people point out MY sin to I Dean again you make an ass of yourself by say that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah be somehow an attempt to paint Jews as plaster saint thereby reveal your inability to understand the discussion as well as show your dislike for people say positive thing about Jews and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignore the simple argument be make and then claim I be ignore the very argument I acknowledge actually what happen be that Dean make it seem like any Jew who give alm or do other act of charity in public be a hypocrite accord to jewish custom in do so he be caricature jewish custom as be almost impossibly demand as well as implicitly slander all Jews who make public their act of charity I go very easily on Dean for this give he the benefit of the doubt in a post follow my initial crack about plaster saint suggest that he have be merely careless in his wording in an astonishing act of ingratitude Dean now serve up an incredibly distort picture of what take place between we and use it as the basis of one insult after another;3

882;I would be happy to discuss the issue of the 12 Imams with you although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate the topic be deeply embed in the world view of Islam and the esoteric teaching of the Prophet S.A. Heresy do not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric religion that be only nominally if at all concern with the metaphysical substance of man 's being and nature a good introductory book in fact one of the good introductory book to Islam in general be Murtaza Mutahhari 's Fundamental of Islamic Thought God Man and the Universe Mizan Press translate by R. Campbell truly a beautiful book a follow up book if you can find a decent translation be Wilaya the Station of the Master by the same author I think it also go under the title of Master and Mastership It 's a very small book really just a transcription of a lecture by the author the introduction to the beautiful Psalms of Islam translate by William C. Chittick available through Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain be also an excellent introduction to the subject we have these book in our University library I imagine any well stocked University library will have they from your post you seem fairly well verse in Sunni thought you should seek to know Shi'ite think through knowledgeable Shi'ite author as well at least that much respect be due before the charge of heresy be level;0

888;I hope I did n't award custody Rich I purposely use handle in order to avoid do so i.e. that happen to be what religion do of course there be aberration like scientific creationism I use well in part to indicate that science currently have a time of it with why and who so these domain be mostly ignore I also attempt to be brief which no doubt confuse the matter as an aside for science I should have write how and when nobody seem to argue over what seem to I that the answer would vary from individual to individual I 'm not try to be evasive on this but from a societal perspective religion work on the other hand sometimes it be abuse and misuse and many suffer which you know but the net result seem positive this from the anthropological perspective on human affair you might call I a neo fruedian insofar as I think the masse ca n't get along without religion not that generally they be incapable- they just do n't and for myriad reason but the main one seem to be the promise of immortality very seductive that immortality therefore it seem that theologian be well equipped than the other you mention for dispense answer to who and why I suggest that this hold regardless of the truth in their answer to who and why simply because people believe in the end spiritual belief be just as real as scientific fact and explanation caution to some do not take this out of context no in fact I do n't think it be close now at least for some individual Is n't there a group of theoretical physicist who argue that matter be create from nothing in a Big Bang singularity this approach might presuppose an absence of who and why except that it seem it could be argue that something have to be responsible for nothing maybe that something does n't have to be supernatural maybe just mechanistic but that be a tough one for people today to grasp in any case theory without empirical datum be not explanation but then your question do not require datum in other word I agree that theorize within scientific parameter be just as scientific as explain so the answer be who and why be not close to scientist but I sense that science in these realm be currently very inadequate datum will be necessary for improvement and that seem a long way off if ever Pretty convoluted here- I hope I 've make sense I agree generally but I prefer to put it this way the   question   of how when who and why be not open to inquiry during the Enlightenment reason be reponsible for question the theological answer to how and when and not for the most part who and why Science be thus bear out of the naturalists curiosity eventually cart away the how and when while largely leave behind the who and why the ignorant the selfish the intolerant and the arrogant of course still claim authority in all four domain much oblige Funny how fact tend to muddle thing is n't it well I be sure there be plenty of scientific creationist rebuttal out there somewhere even if they have to be create from nothing   just for the record again AMH   anatomically modern human   Best regard;3

1997 after gravity assist of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004 upon arrival the Cassini spacecraft perform several maneuver to achieve an orbit around Saturn near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens Probe separate from the Orbiter and descend through the atmosphere of Titan the Orbiter relay the Probe datum to Earth for about 3 hour while the Probe enter and traverse the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter continue tour the saturnian system for three and a half year Titan synchronous orbit trajectory will allow about 35 flyby of Titan and target flyby of Iapetus Dione and Enceladus the objective of the mission be threefold conduct detailed study of Saturn 's atmosphere ring and magnetosphere- conduct close up study of Saturn 's satellite and characterize Titan 's atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspect of Titan be the possibility that its surface may be cover in part with lake of liquid hydrocarbon that result from photochemical process in its upper atmosphere these hydrocarbon condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titan 's cloud and determine if there be liquid on the surface experiment aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will

Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe which he call the Reciprocal System be build on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe be compose ENTIRELY of one component MOTION exist in three dimension in DISCRETE unit and in two RECIPROCAL form SPACE and TIME 2 the physical universe conform to the relation of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematic its magnitude be ABSOLUTE and its geometry be EUCLIDEAN from these two postulate Larson develop a COMPLETE theoretical Universe use various combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational- rotational motion the concept of IN ward and OUT ward SCALAR MOTIONS and speed in relation to the Speed of Light which Larson call UNIT VELOCITY and the NATURAL DATUM at each step in the development Larson be able to MATCH object in his theoretical Universe with object in the REAL physical universe photon sub atomic particle   INCOMPLETE ATOMS   charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar ETC even object not yet discover then such as EXPLODING galaxy and GAMMA RAY BURSTS and apply his theory to his new model of the atom Larson be able to precisely and accurately calculate inter- atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of this be describe in good detail with OUT fancy complex mathematic in his book BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson the following be a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe some of the early book be out of print now but still available through inter library loan the Structure of the Physical Universe 1959 the case against the Nuclear Atom 1963 beyond Newton 1964 New Light on Space and Time 1965 Quasars and Pulsars 1971 nothing but MOTION 1979   a   9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the   8.3 billion Super Collider    the last four chapter explain chemical bonding   the Neglected Facts of Science 1982 the UNIVERSE of MOTION 1984   FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery   BASIC property of matter 1988 all but the last of these book be publish by North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland or 97213 and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library does n't have each of they several of they include the last one be available from the International Society of Unified Science ISUS 1680 E. Atkin Ave Salt Lake City Utah 84106 this be the organization that be start to promote Larson 's theory they have other related publication include the quarterly journal RECIPROCITY Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson be a retired engineer Chemical or Electrical he be about 91 year old when he die in May 1989 he have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University he develop his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical property base only on the element use Larson 's lack of a fancy ph.d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore he but it be not a VALID reason sometimes it take a relative outsider to CLEARLY see the forest through the TREES at the same time it be clear from his book that he also know ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction AD HOC assumption principle of IMPOTENCE IN CONSISTENCIES ETC Larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it be not necessary for he to do so he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational datum and in many case his explanation FIT BETTER a self consistent theory be much MORE than the ORTHODOX physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for a unified field theory that work but have be ignore one for over 30 year now modern physics do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of Larson 's book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that epicycle crystal sphere geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seem to explain it well but be later prove CONCEPTUALLY wrong Prof. Frank H. Meyer Professor Emeritus of UW Superior be   be a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson 's theory and be or still be President of Larson 's organization the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY of UNIFIED SCIENCE and Editor of their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY he move to Minneapolis after retire Super Collider BOONDOGGLE I be against contruction of the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas or anywhere else it would be a gross WASTE of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value Most physicist do n't realize it but accord to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson as describe in his book the strange GOOFY particle meson hyperon ALLEGED quark etc which they be find in existing collider Fermi Lab Cern etc be really just ATOMS of ANTI MATTER which be create by the high energy colliding beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment a large and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti matter that the physicist have not see there before and the physicist will be even more confuse than they be now be a few more type of anti matter atom worth the   8.3 billion cost do n't we have much more important use for this waste money another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in Texas have a serious and grow problem with some kind of fire ant eat the insulation off underground cable how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the Supercollider name the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as propose be TOTALLY ABSURD if it be build it should be name after a lead particle physicist LARSONIAN Anti Matter in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe anti matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it have more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which Larson call Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum in Larson 's theory a positron be actually a particle of MATTER not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in Larson 's theory the ANTI matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of TIME and only one dimension of space and exist in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half LARSONIAN Relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury have be observe and precisely measure to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 second of arc per century 531 second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet Venus Earth Jupiter etc the remain 43 second of arc be be use to help prove Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity but the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieve result close to the 43 second than General Relativity can by instead use SPECIAL relativity in one or more of his book he apply the LORENTZ transformation on the high orbital speed of Mercury Larson TOTALLY reject General Relativity as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY he also reject most of Special Relativity include the part about mass increase near the speed of light and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shift great than 1.000 REALLY be move fast than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from we in TIME in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure be the CLOCK time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be NEGLIGIBLE- but at high speed they become significant and the Lorentz Transformation must be use as a FUDGE FACTOR   Larson often use the term coordinate TIME when write about this   in regard to mass increase it have be prove in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration   FORCE   MASS a   F   m Orthodox physicist be ignore the THIRD factor FORCE in Larson 's theory mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drop toward zero FORCE be actually a motion or combination of motion or relation between motion include INward and OUTward SCALAR motion the expansion of the universe for example be an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so call Big Bang which be yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY the UNIVERSE of MOTION I wish to recommend to everyone the book the UNIVERSE of MOTION by Dewey B. Larson 1984 North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland Oregon 97213 456 page index hardcover it contain the astrophysical portion of a GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by that author an UNrecognized geniu more than thirty year ago it contain FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the FORMATION of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true ORIGIN of the 3 degree background radiation cosmic ray and gamma- ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf explode galaxy etc it contain what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the following be an example of his Theory 's success in his first book in 1959 the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE Larson predict the existence of EXPLODING galaxy several year before astronomer start find they they be a NECESSARY consequence of Larson 's comprehensive theory and when QUASARS be discover he have an immediate relate explanation for they also GAMMA RAY BURSTS Astro physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious GAMMA RAY BURSTS they be originally think to originate from neutron star in the disc of our galaxy but the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit have be detect they in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any known object except for a few case of directional coincidence Gamma ray burst be a NECESSARY consequence of the GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson accord to page 386 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION publish in 1984 the gamma ray burst be come from SUPERNOVA explosion in the ANTI matter HALF of the physical universe which Larson call the Cosmic Sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with known object and come from all direction uniformly I wonder how close to we in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the MASS extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby GAMMA RAY BURSTS LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of they but binary star system be actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson I will try to summarize Larsons explanation which be detail in chapter 7 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION and in some of his other book first of all accord to Larson star do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the COMPLETE annihilation of heavy element heavy than IRON each element have a destructive TEMPERATURE LIMIT the heavy the element be the low be this limit a star 's internal temperature increase as it grow in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of light and light element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of IRON there be a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION this be because there be so much iron present- and that be relate to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which Larson explain in some of his book   well than I can   when the star explode the light material on the outer portion of the star be blow outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavy material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expand OUTWARD in TIME which be equivalent to inward in SPACE and it often actually disappear for a while over long period of time both masse start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blow outward in space now start to form a red GIANT star the material that have be blow OUTWARD in TIME start to form a WHITE DWARF star both star then start move back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the H R Diagram the chance of the two masse fall back into the exact same location in space make a single lone star again be near zero they will instead form a BINARY system orbit each other accord to Larson a white dwarf star have an inverse DENSITY gradient be dense at its SURFACE because the material at its center be most widely disperse blow outward in time this eliminate the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL fantasy about degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc LARSONIAN Solar System Formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affect by its heat etc these will become PLANETS in chapter 7 of the UNIVERSE of MOTION Larson use all this information and other principle of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode 's Law Black Hole FANTASY I hear that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black hole merge together into a single black hole and conclude that the new black hole would have MORE mass than the sum of the two original black hole such a result should be recognize by everyone as a RED FLAG cause widespread doubt about the whole IDEA of black hole etc after read Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe especially his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION it be clear to I that black hole be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL fantasy the strange object at Cygnus X-1 be just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to prove their theory by the way I do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist Stephen Hawking the physicist and astronomer seem to be act as if Hawking 's severe physical problem somehow make he wise it do not I wish the same attention have be give to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he be still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to Larson 's theory book and organization the International Society of Unified Science ELECTRO MAGNETIC PROPULSION I hear of that concept many year ago in connection with UFO 's and unorthodox inventor but I never be able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct I find a possible clue about why they might work on page 112 113 of the book BASIC property of MATTER by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson which describe part of Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe I quote one paragraph as indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrive at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it be bring out in volume I   Larson 's book nothing but MOTION   that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorb by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited it follow that there be always a large excess of free electron in the material sector   material half   of the universe most of which be uncharged in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remain permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate be thus expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there be other process to be discuss later whereby electron be return to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilize at an equilibrium level note that in Larson 's theory UNcharged electron be also massLESS and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spin around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity be the speed of light and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light accord to Larson 's theory   I might have the above and below label mix up   Larson be say that outer space be fill with mass- LESS UN charge electron fly around at the speed of light if this be true then the ELECTRO MAGNETIC propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhaps give they a charge and mass and shoot they toward the rear to achieve propulsion in Larson 's theory an electrical charge be a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimpose on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confused meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud suppression of LARSONIAN Physics the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson have be available for more than 30 year publish in 1959 in his first book the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE it be TOTALLY UN SCIENTIFIC for Hawking Wheeler Sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call science or physic or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education system to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson 's theory have they have Larson 's theory have excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer such as gamma ray burst and the nature of quasar Larson 's theory deserve to be HONESTLY and openly discuss in the physics chemistry and astronomy journal in the U.S. and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of Larson 's theory should be include in all related course at UW EC UW Madison Cambridge Cornell University and elsewhere so that student be not keep in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they be be feed for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited source especially Larson 's BOOKS UN altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this important partial summary be ENCOURAGED;2

971;okay let get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun the project manager be Dr. John Hunter and he work for the Laser group at Livermore what you may ask do gas gun have to do with laser nothing really but the gun be physically locate across the road from the Free Electron Laser building and the FEL building have a heavily shield control room thick wall from which the gun firing be control so I suspect that the office he work for be an administrative convenience I visit Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we tour the gun at the time I be work on gas gun rd at Boeing where I work but I be now do other thing help to save the space station the gun use a methane air mixture which be burn in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID i.e. it look like a pipe the chamber hold a 1 ton piston which be propel at several hundred m   s down the chamber on the other side of the piston be hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome ten of atmosphere the piston compress and heat the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm rupture at around 50,000 psi the barrel of the gun be about 100 foot long and have a 4 inch bore it be mount at right angle to the chamber i.e. they intersect this be do so that in the future the barrel could be raise and the gun fire into the air without have to move the large and heavy chamber the projectile be use in testing be a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long all of the acceleration come from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downward until the projectile leave the barrel the barrel be evacuate and the end be seal with a sheet of plastic film a little thick than Saran wrap the plastic be blow off by the small amount of residual air trap in the barrel ahead of the projectile the gun be fire into a bunker fill with sandbag and plastic water jug in the early testing fragment of the plastic projectile be find at the high speed in later testing the projectile vaporize the testing be into a bunker because the Livermore test range be about 3 mile across and the projectile would go 100 200 km if fire for maximum range the intent be to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing be complete where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectile the design goal of the gun be to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km   s half of orbital speed so far they have reach 2 km   s and the gun be currently down for repair as on the last test they blow a seal and damage some of the hardware I think it have to do with the methane air more detonating than burn but I have n't have a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this there be people wait to test scramjet component in this gun by fire then out of the gun into the air at Mach 12 4 km   s since the most you can get in wind tunnel be Mach 8 this gun cost about 4 million to develop and be basically a proof of concept for a big gun capable of fire useful- sized payload into space this would require on the order of 100 kg projectile which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit Dani Eder;2

973;this kind of argument cry for a comment    God do not create    disease nor be he responsible for the malady of newborn      what God do create be life accord to a protein code which be    mutable and can evolve without delve into a deep discussion of    creationism vs evolutionism God create the original genetic code    perfect and without flaw      do you have any evidence for this if the code be once perfect and have degrade ever since we   should   have some evidence in favour of this statement should n't we perhaps the big imperfection of the code be that it be full of non coding region intron which be so call because they intervene with the code region exon an impressive amount of evidence suggest that intron be of very ancient origin- it be likely that early exon represent early protein domain be the number of intron decrease or increase it appear that intron loss can occur and specie with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon intron structure in their gene on the other hand the possibility that intron have be insert later present several logical difficulty intron be remove by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if intron be insert moreover intron insertion would have require   precise   target random insertion would not be tolerate since sequence for intron removal self splicing of mRNA be conserve besides transposition of a sequence usually leave a trace long terminal repeat and target site duplication and these be not find in or near intron sequence I seriously recommend read textbook on molecular biology and genetic before post theological argument like this try Watson 's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell Lodish   Baltimore 's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starter remember the question be pose in a theological context why do God cause disease in newborn and my answer be likewise from a theological perspective my own it be no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective be support by the evidence whereas theological perspective often fail to fulfil this criterion I think you misread my meaning I say God make the genetic code perfect but that does n't mean it 's perfect now it have certainly evolve since for the bad would you please cite a few reference that support your assertion your assertion be less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it have be claim that parasite and disease be perhaps more important than we 've thought for instance sex might have evolve as defence against parasite this view be support by computer simulation of evolution eg Tierra perhaps I think it be high energy ray like X ray gamma ray and cosmic ray that cause most of the damage in fact it be thermal energy that do most of the damage although it be usually mild and easily fix by enzymatic action actually neither of we know what the atmosphere be like at the time when God create life accord to my recollection most biologist do not claim that life begin 4 billion year ago after all that would only be a half billion year or so after the earth be create it would still be too primitive to support life I seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion year ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a well estimate i 'd replace create with form since there be no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be form without one Most recent estimate of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 4.8 billion year and early sign of life not true fossil but organic stromatolite like layer date back to 3.5 billion year this would leave more than billion year for the first cell to evolve I 'm sorry I ca n't give any reference this be base on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attend here    dominion it be no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer    disease both bacterial   viral and genetic although the force of    natural selection tend to improve the survivability of specie the    degeneration of the genetic code tend to more than offset this again do you   want   this be true or do you have any evidence for this suppose degeneration I can understand Scott 's reaction   excuse I but this be so far fetched that I know you must be   jesting do you know what pathogen be do you know what   Point Mutations be do you know that everything can come   about SPONTANEOUSLY in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you can not   know   that I hope you do n't forget this we have   evidence   that suggest everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one do not have to   believe   in anything it be a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk be to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one 's own conclusion prior to this Theology do not use this method therefore I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusion    Human DNA be more complex tend to accumulate error adversely    affect our well being and ability to fight off disease while the    simple dna of bacteria and virus tend to become more efficient in    cause infection and disease it be a bad combination hence    we have newborn that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial    disease   disorder you be suppose a purpose not a valid move Bacteria and virus do not exist to cause disease they be just another manifest of a general principle of evolution only replication save replicator from degradiation we be just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient method did n't make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA be degrade through evolutionary process some people have claim that the opposite be true we have suppress our selection and thus be bind to degrade I have n't see much evidence for either claim but then I ask so where be this relevant to my discussion in answer John 's question of why why be there genetic disease and why be there so many bacterial and viral disease which require baby to develop antibody be it God 's fault the original question I say no it be not of course nothing evil be god 's fault but your explanation do not work it fail miserably you may be right but the fact be that you do n't know that Satan be not responsible and neither do I. suppose that a powerful evil be like Satan exist would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ill that affect mankind I do n't think so he could have do a much well Job Pun intend the problem be it seem no Satan be necessary to explain any disease they be just as inevitable as any product of evolution do I say that where seem to I like another bad inference actually what you 've do be to oversimplify what I say to the point that your summary of my word take on a new context I never say that people be mean presumably by God to be punish by get disease why I do say be that free moral choice have attendent consequence if mankind choose to reject God as people have do since the beginning then they should not expect God to protect they from adverse event in an entropic universe I be not expect this if god exist I expect he to leave we alone I would also like to hear why do you believe your choice be indeed free this be an interesting philosophical question and the answer be not as clear cut as it seem to be what consequence would you expect from reject Allah oh I admit it 's not perfect yet but I 'm work on it a good library or a bookstore be a good starting point what do this have to do with the price of tea in China or the question to which I provide an answer Biology and Genetics be fine subject and important scientific endeavor but they explain   how   God create and set up life process they do n't explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why be there a why behind and your proposition be something that be not support by the evidence this be why we recommend these book be there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theory Hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this Thanks Scotty for your fine and sagely advice but I be not highly motivated to learn all the nitty gritty detail of biology and genetic although I 'm sure i 'd find it a fascinating subject for I realize that the detail do not change the Big Picture that God create life in the begin with the ability to change and adapt to its environment I 'm sorry but they do there be no evidence for your big picture

980;my poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masse sit very close to Jupiter play any role whatsoever in the problem or to put it more technically the extra volume they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectory be negligible Jupiter be 2e27 kg while the Galilean satellite be around 1e23 also as I say the few reference that I 've look at do not mention outgas or breakup as important process the important thing be a Jupiter Sun comet reverse slingshot that lead to a weakly Jupiter bind orbit for the comet at least a temporary one;2
981;Tony- I read your post it be nothing new I have see much the same in other typicalchristian anti gay sentimental literature gay people be and will con- tinue to be persecute as long as such propaganda petpetuate you may be unaware of all the statistica finding concern African Americans that have be publish and use by various group to re enforce their own bias against African Americans we usually think of the KKK in these instance but there be many other group of course the vast majority of the public scoff at such finding and document today but that be not always the case fortunately African Americans have white who support their 'cause and public sentiment be eventually if not entirely turn around there be even a Civil War and anti negro sentiment increase in fact until law be put in place to protect the inalienable right of Blacks it be pretty much legal to discriminate against they I know many gay and I will not turn my back on they or their right to be free form discrimination you may think that I have be deceive or something that be your perogative my church Christian Church Disciples of Christ openly affirm the right of oppressed people of all segment of society include gay we believe the Gospel message of preach to all creation and make disciple we believe in the lord 's great commandment to Love and we beleive in stand up for the oppressed even if it be not popular to do so I really like my church for last reason the most I can find a church almost anywhere in the valley that stand for the Gospel and believe in the commandment of Love though I 'm hard pressed to find many who actually sho love but not many be willing to champion the oppressed especially within their own community I may have lose face with the great christian community for the unpopularity of my belief but so do the abolitionist against the oppression of African Americans many be even kill and treat as runaway slave for be nigger lover and such I guess I 've decide the challenge be worth it in my talk with gay man and woman I have hear tragic story after tragic story center around fail marriage wife and husband who be straight who have be hurt in the process etc funny thing be I do n't know of one case where the parent ex wife or even child have continue to reject their gay family member son daughter ex husband father etc after they begin to take part in some form of support group like PFLAG I 'm apalle by the legislation which pass in Colorado and be equally out0 rage that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon from the Tradition Values Coalition have be actively work in the Christian underground to garner support within several 8 I believe state this come November for more oppressive legisation against gay perhaps you do n't get it and maybe you never will many did n't get it in the Middle Ages and the proclaimed God 's will be do as they massacre thousand in witch hunt and inquisition the message that come through loud and clear by proponent against gay right and against gay in general be that there be a strong dislike even hatred for gay whether you want to call it such or not it does n't change the result the major flaw in all this posturing be that in the end the final effect of post like that of yours and Mr. Hudson be that you have a conditional love for gay condition Change and we 'll love you this be sure strange come from a group who claim that God have an unconditional love one that call people just as they be sure there be thing that will naturally change and habit like alcoholism wife beating etc that need to be change through some sort of therapy but then there be thing like left handedness etc that no amount of beat it out of people be go to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other people 's expectation in the process this coerce conformity cause many people a great deal of harm especially when it be cause by people who have nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puff up about their own sense of pseuper spirituality this be sad but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change it may be unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis have to do with something very personal like sexuality a taboo subject even today but I firmly believe in the right of individual to be free from impose regulation on thier bedroom It 's funny that most straight people have successfully remove restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression as though it help we maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay people be not criminal another interesting thing happen recently a very prominent charismatic church in the Silicon Valley here have two of it 's pastor arrest for self- admit charge of pederasty man have sex with boy this have apparently be go on for some time a couple year but since the charge be voluntary and the church work closely with the police so I imagine that be how they manage to downplay it in the medium how could such a thing happen when the church itself have an ex gay ministry one of my friend recently tell I he be approach by someone who be go through the reparitive therapy there and he be thoroughly convinced that the request for dinner be not an invitation to attend the ministry these be difficult time we live in but provide hostile environment and create and perpetuate an atmosphere that breed hate and violence be not the call of the christian community the result of the pass amendment in Colorado have create an organization who 's poster be appear all over Colorado call S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T. I forget the whole definition off hand but the last part be against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash and their motto be work for a fag free America with an implicit advocation for violence this be sick and it seem to be what you and Mr. Hudson and other be embrace we Christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression towards those we feel do n't measure up and constant beratement from organization like the Christian Research Institute while they do have a good purpose also their major work seem to be find new and well way of exclude people the Gospel I believe be not so negative rather it seek way to include people I have several of Dr. Martin 's book and find they quite helpful especially concern cults but it seem that CRI have become a cult unto itself why do n't we just stick to the positive and find way to bring people to Jesus istead of take bullwhip and drive they away whatever;3

983;actuallay I do n't but on the other hand I do n't support the idea of have one newsgroup for every aspect of graphic programming as propose by Brian in his reply to my original posting I would suggest a loose structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer comp.graphics.hwandsw the reason for make as few group as possible be for the same reason you say we should n't spill up not to get to few posting every day I take to much time to browse through all posting just to find two or three I 'm interested in I understand and agree when you say you want all aspect of graphic in one meeting I agree to some extension I see news as a forum to exchange idea help other or to be help I think this be difficult to achive if there be so many different thing in one meeting good evening netters-;1
984;twhy do n't you consider phigs in x or PEX lib;1

986;maybe I should point out that we be not talk about c.s.amiga   only comp.graphic;1
987;I    Jim       I always think that homophobe be only a word use at Act up    rally I did n't beleive real people use it Let 's see if we agree    on the term 's definition a homophobe be one who actively and    militantly attack homosexual because he be actually a latent    homosexual who use his hostility to conceal his true orientation    since everyone who disapprove of or condemn homosexuality be a    homophobe your implication be clear it must necessarily follow that    all man be latent homosexual or bisexual at the very least    crap crap crap crap crap a definition of any type of phobe come from phobia   an irrational fear of hence a homophobe not only in ACT UP meeting the word be apparently in general use now or perhaps it is n't in the bible wouldst thou prefer if I be to communicate with thou in bilespeak do an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of be a spider do an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of be a wide open space do you understand English obviously someone who have phobia will react to it they will do their good to avoid it and if that be not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashing occur because of natural process People who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause they or themselves violence Is n't that what I say what be you take issue with here your remark be merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful        it would seem odd if homosexuality have any evolutionary function    other than limit population growth since evolution only occur    when the member of one generation pass along their trait to    subsequent generation homosexuality be an evolutionary deadend if I    take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to    intend then all man be really homosexual and evolution of our    specie at least be go nowhere    so   every   time a man have sex with a woman they intend to produce child hmm no wonder the world be overpopulate obviously you keep to the Monty Python song every sperm be sacred and if as   you   say it have a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it be by your own arguement natural consider the context I 'm talk about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirement of evolution be that member of a species procreate those who do n't have no purpose in that context    another point be that if the offspring of each generation be to    survive the participation of both parent be necessary a family must    exist since homosexual do not reproduce they can not constitute a    family since the majority of humankind be part of a family    homosexuality be an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you    will    well if that be true by your own arguement homosexual would have vanish   year   ago due to non procreation also the parent from single parent family should put the baby out in the cold now cos they must by your arguement die by your argument homosexuality be genetically determine as to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context mean I be talk about evolution the preservation of the specie the fundamental premise of the whole process    but it get bad since the overwhelming majority of people actually    -prefer- a heterosexual relationship homosexuality be a social    abberation as well the homosexual eschew the biological imperative    to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in    the most fundamental social element the family but wait there 's    more    read the above I expect you to have at least ten child by now with the family grow these day sex be less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no one but more to do with pleasure in pre pill and pre condom day if you have sex there be the chance of produce child these day be just ai n't true People can decide whether or not to have child and when soon they will be able to choose it 's sex   c but that be another arguement so it 's more of a lifestyle decision again by your arguement since homosexual can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not child both be as unnatural as each other yet another non sequitur sex be an evolutionary function that exist for procreation that it be also recreation be incidental that homosexual do n't procreate mean that sex be -only- recreation and nothing more- they serve no -evolutionary- purpose    since homosexual have come out the closet and have convince some    policy maker that they have civil right they be now claim that    their sexuality be a preference a life style an orientation a    choice that should be protect by law now if homosexuality be a mere    choice and if it be both contrary to nature and anti social then it    be a perverse choice- they have even less credibility than before they    become prominent    People be people be people who be you to tell anyone else how to live their life be you god(tm if so fancy a date Here 's pretty obvious dodge do you really think you 've say anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement I be not tell anyone anything I be demonstrate that there be argument against the practice of homosexuality provide it 's a merely an alternate lifestlye that be not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand I realize of course that this come dangerously close to establish a value and that atheist be compel to object on that basis but if you be to be consistent you have no case in this regard    to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic be to    ignore some very compelling argument against the legitimization of    the homosexual life style but since the charge be only intend to    intimidate it 's really just demogoguery and not to be take    seriously fact be Jim there be far more persuasive argument for    suppress homosexuality than those give but consider this a start    again crap all your argument be base on outdated ideal likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generation spawn by a bastard to eternal damnation or someone who crush his penis either accidently or not both be in Deuteronomy I 'm sure your comment pertain to something but you 've disguise it so well I ca n't see what where do I mention ideal out date or otherwise your argument be very reactionary- do you have anything at all to contribute    as to why homosexual should be exclude from participation in    scouting the reason be the same as those use to restrict they from    teaching- by their own logic homosexual be deviate social and    biological since any adult be a role model for a child it be    incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolate from    those who would do the child harm in this case harm mean primarily    social though that could be extend easily enough       you show I   anyone   who have sex in a way that everyone would describe as normal and will take of my hat Puma baseball cap to you one man 's meat be another man 's poison what have this get to do with anything would you pick a single point that you find offensive and explain your objection I would really like to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly;0
988;you keep say that I do not think it mean what you think it mean perhaps you should explain what you think science have it 's basis in value mean the reason why people do science be that they value it 's result that do not mean that science have it 's basis in value any more than DES stop work if I stop value my privacy see above -Ekr;3

992;our group recently buy a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it we buy this thing because it 1 have a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal input and 2 claim to print 256 gray level image however the manual that come with it only describe how to format the parallel datum to print 1 and 4 bit   pixel image after some initial problem with the parallel interface I now have this thing run from a parallel port of an Hewlett Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit   pixel image just fine I call the Mitsubishi people and ask about the 256 level claim and they say that be only available when use with the video signal input this be not mention in the sale literature however they do say the P78U can do 6 bit   pixel 64 level image in parallel mode but they did n't have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call Japan etc frankly I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit   pixel image from the video source it ca n't store 8 bit   pixel in the memory It 's not like memory be that expensive any more if anybody have any information on get 6 bit   pixel or even 8 bit   pixel image out of this thing I would greatly appreciate your send it to I thank;1

999;   please enlighten I how be omnipotence contradictory   by definition all that can occur in the universe be govern by the rule   of nature thus god can not break they anything that god do must be allow   in the rule somewhere therefore omnipotence CANNOT exist it contradict   the rule of nature obviously an omnipotent god can change the rule when you say by definition what exactly be be defined- certainly not omnipotence you seem to be say that the rule of nature be pre existant somehow that they not only define nature but actually cause it if that be what you mean i 'd like to hear your further thought on the question;0
1000;I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature this feature adjust the endpoint of line so that the display line look well on low resolution device the PostScript literature explain the process to some extent they also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in PostScript environment where it be absent the suggest emulation be to modify the coordinate of the endpoint of a line use the follow formula for each coordinate tnewcoord   round oldcoord 0.25   0.25 t do this we end up with all coordinate end in .25 from read I think that what they might actually do be tnewcoord   trunc oldcoord   2   2   0.25 t this result in all the coordinate end in either 0.25 or 0.75 whichever be close by do some actual comparison with Display PostScript I find that neither of these be what DPS really use since I like how the dps result look well than how my stuff look i 'd like to know if anyone who know how DPS do it be willing   able to tell I thank;1

1002;the argument go as follow Q oid quote appear in John but not in the almost codified way they be in Matthew or Luke however they be consider to be similar enough to point to knowledge of Q as such and not an entirely different source we be talk date of text here not the age of the author the usual explanation for the time order of Mark Matthew and Luke do not consider their respective age it say Matthew have read the text of Mark and Luke that of Matthew and probably that of Mark as it be assume that John know the content of Luke 's text the evidence for that be not overwhelming admittedly when they be from about 200 why do they shed doubt on the order on put John after the rest of the three sure an original together with I d card of sender and receiver would be fine so what that suppose to say be I miss something that John be a disciple be not generally accept the style and language together with the theology be usually use as counterargument the argument that John be a disciple relie on the claim in the gospel of John itself be there any other evidence for it one step and one generation remove be bad even in our time compare that to report of similar event in our century in almost illiterate society not even to speak off that believer be not necessarily the good source in other word one do not know what the original of Mark do look like and argument base on Mark be pretty weak;0

1009;Brian K. guess what you miss the point on a scale from cold to hot you be at 0 degree Kelvin then as you understand it what be it yes I agree with that but what do that have to do with Jesus punishment you say Jesus do not regard his death as punishment Good I would n't either not the way you understand it ask Jesus himself he himself say why in John 12:23 32 it is n't a mystery to anyone and there certainly be no need for a persuasive argument Read Jesus 's own reply to your question Jesus give more reason in John 16:7 but one obvious reason why Jesus die and as with everything else it have nothing do with his punishment be that he could rise to life again so that we would stop doubt and believe John 21:27 the fact that Jesus rise from the dead be my hope that I too will rise from the dead it be an obvious point do not overlook it without this obvious point I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity why do Jesus suffer in his death again ask Jesus Jesus say why in John 15:18 25 That 's no mystery either the world hate he without reason it be a direct proclamation of how far we human botch thing up and thus how much we need a saviour;3

1025;  Rick Anderson reply to my letter with    ra   in article   C5ELp2.L0Cacsu.buffalo.edu     ra     just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to   differ interpretation of create and say that many Christians may   not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base our faith   on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line be   truth regardless of popularity of opinion it may be irrelevant to you and   your   personal belief or should I say bias but it be relevant to I and many other You 're right the bottom line be truth independant from you or anyone else since you proclaim truth as a self proclaim appointee may I ask you by what authority you do this because it say so in the Bible --doe the Bible say so or be it you or someone else who interpret whether a scripture or doctrine conform to your particular liking or disapproval Excuse moi but your line of truth have n't move I one bit to persuade I that my belief be erroneous of all the preacher of truth on this net you have strike I as a self righteous member of the wreck crew with no positive message to I or other latter day saint whatsoever BTW this entire discussion remind I a lot of the thing say by Jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrite(s ye preach about I with your lip but your heart be far removed from I   also I find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create   and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the Mormon   belief you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to   have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to address   and answer the point that be raise and not just jump to the   conclusion that you grant Sophistry look who 's talking jump to conclusion you would n't do that yourself right all you address be your own conviction regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of view because you reject such interpretation without any consideration whatsoever    the Bible state that Lucifer be create the Bible state that Jesus   be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the LDS   belief be that Jesus and Lucifer be the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine the former KGB would have love to employ you Jesus and lucifer be not the same silly and you know it   the Mormon belief be that all be child of God literally there be   nothing symbolic about it this however contradict what the Bible   say the Bible teach that not everyone be a child of God Correction it may contradict would you think the Bible say the Bible indeed do teach that not all be child of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in his footstep Satan and his follower have rebel against God and be not child follower   redeem of God but it does n't mean that they be not once create by God but choose to separate themselves from those who choose to follow God and his plan of salvation    the field be the world- the good seed be the child of the   kingdom- but the tare be the child of the wicked one-   Matthew 13:38 kingdom be those who have remain valiant in their testimony of Jesus and have show work of repentance etc and the child of the wicked one be those who rebel against God and the lamb the issue of satan 's spirit offspring and those who follow he have not be address in this and other verse you copy from your Bible you purposefully obscure the subject by swamp your right with non- relate scripture lot of nice scripture delete not Robert W. copyright though   ra    we be tell that and this be life eternal that they might know   ra    thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast send   ra    John 17:3 life eternal be to know the only true God yet the   ra    doctrine of the lds that I have mention portray a vastly   ra    different Jesus a Jesus that can not be reconcile with the Jesus of   ra    the Bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim Correction my Jesus be indeed different than your Jesus and can be reconcile with the Jesus in the Bible --not your interpretation of Him I concur but I honestly could n't care less   ra    one as be true deny the other from be true accord to the   ra    Bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true God and   ra    not the construct of imagination in this single posting of your i 've see more construct of imagination than in all of the pro lds mail combine I have read so far in this news group first get your lds fact straight before you dare preach to we about the only true God whom you interpret accord to your own like and dislike but whose image I can not reconcile with what I know about he myself I guess your grandiose self image do not allow for other faith believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ but in a different way or fashion than your own not that it really matter the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progress until it have visit every continent sweep every clime and sound in every ear   this be really a red herring it does n't address any issue raise but   rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read   something into the Bible does n't change what the Bible teach Sigh what the Bible teach or what the bible teach accord to Robert Weiss and co. I respect the former I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have reject Jesus on the contrary and by the way I do respect your interpretation of the Bible I even grant you be a Christian follow your own image of Him as much as I be a Christian follow my own image of he in my heart   Most of the other reply have instead hop scotch to the issue of   Bruce McConkie and whether his view be official doctrine I do n't   think that it matter if McConkie 's view be canon that be not the   issue be McConkie 's writing indicative of Mormon belief on this   subject be the real issue the indication from Rick be that they may   certainly be the issue be of course that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church the issue of official doctrine be obviously very important McConkie 's view have be controversial e.g. the Seven Deadly Heresies have make I a heretic at good or erroneous at bad black not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation I respect he as someone who have make his valuable contribution to the church but I personally do not rely on his personal interpretation his book Mormon Doctrine be oftentime refer to as McConkie 's Bible in mormon circle on mormon doctrine I rather look to official doctrinal source and to Hugh Nibley 's book the last comment be an lds insider reference Summarizing McConkie be a wise man who contribute undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have but whose view be by no means dogma or accept doctrine some of it clearly belong to personal interpretation and speculation but having say this I find McConkie even in his most biased and speculative moment far more thought provoking than the trash come from your proverbial pen I 'm somewhat appalled that I have allow myself to sink as low as you in this posting                               Robert Weiss psyrobtwubvms.cc.buffalo.edu;3
1026;true at first the news medium seemed entrance by all the new gizmos the military be use not to mention the tape video transmission from the missile as they zero in on their target but later and especially after the bunker full of civilian be hit they change their tone it seem to I that they did n't have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and be maim in warfare It 's like they be only pro gulf War as long as it be nice and clean smart missile drop in on military HQs but not when picture of dead dying and maim civilian start crop up what naive hypocrite   discussion about blanket bombing and a bomb delete    I should have say here militarily justified it seem from your comment below that you understand this as mean morally justified I apologize I have often wonder about this I 've always think that the first bomb should have be drop on Japan 's island fortress of Truk a good inpenatrable military target the second bomb could 've be hold back for use on an industrial center if need be but I digress yes I have hear that we find evidence after the war BTW that Japan be seriously consider surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta win out over the moderate and reject the US 's ulimatum therefore the second bomb be drop most unfortunate imo I do n't regret the fact that sometimes military decision have to be make which affect the life of innocent people but I do regret the circumstance which make those decision necessary and I regret the suffering cause by those decision     actually it be the fact that both situation exist that prompt US and allied action if some back water country take over some other back water country we probably would n't intervene not that we do n't care but we ca n't be the world 's policman or if a coup have occur in Kuwait instead of an invasion then we still would n't have act because there would not have be the imminent danger perceive to Saudi Arabia but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the West 's oil interest cause we to take action     i 'm not set up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative be to allow Hussein to keep Kuwait diplomatic alternative include sanction be ineffective well in a sense yes they probably have no idea of what end Hitler would lead their nation to they suffer along with the rest why do this bother you so much the world be full of evil and circumstance be not perfect many innocent suffer due to the wrongful action of other it it regretable but that 's the way it Is there be no perfect solution     probably because we 're not the savior of the world we ca n't police each and every country that decide to self destruct or invade another nor be we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet East Timor or some other place tell I how we could stop they and I 'll support it I for one do not agree with the present US policy of suck up to they as you put it I agree that it be deplorable be they or be they suppose to reflect the population of the locale where the trial be hold normally this be where the crime be commit unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue be in order i 'm not an expert on California law or even US law but it seem that this be the way the system be set up you can criticize the system but let 's not have unfounded allegation of racial prejudice throw around no not at all the point be that the fact that there be no black on the first jury and that Rodney King be black be totally irrelevant german perhaps Peers does n't mean those who do the same thing like have murderer judge murderer it mean have people from the same station in life presumably because they be in a well position to understand the defendent 's motivation(s OK grant however you be use this reasoning as part of   your   logical argument in this discussion this be not a court of law the media be not totally monolithic even though there be a prevail liberal bias program such as the MacNeil Lehrer News Hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there be even conservative source out there if you know where to look Hurrah for Rush BTW I never use the word conspiracy I do n't accept without   far   more evidence theory that there be some all pervade liberal conspiracy attempt to take over all news source hardly I did n't say that it 's a Good thing   tm   to kill innocent people if the end be just unfortunately we do n't live in a perfect world and there be no perfect solution if one be go to resist tyranny then innocent people on both side be go to suffer and die I did n't say it be ok it be unfortunate but sometimes necessary I would agree that it be evil in the sense that it cause much pain and suffering I 'm not so sure that it be unnecessary as you say that conclusion can only be arrive at by evaluate all the factor involve and perhaps it   be   unnecessary as let 's say we now know that does n't mean that those who have to make the decision to bomb did n't see it as be necessary rarely can one have full know of the consequence of an action before make a decision at the time it may have seem necessary enough to go ahead with it but do n't assume that I feel the bombing be   morally   justified I do n't I just do n't condemn those who have to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstance you certainly be not in such a position if you be a moral relativist I as an absolutist be in a position to judge but I defer judgment Wrong they be neither moral then nor now they seem necessary to those make the decision to bring a quick end to the war I simply refuse to condemn they for their decision one day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action- even this discourse in this forum I understand the full ramification of that and I be prepared to do so I do n't believe that you can make the same claim and BTW the reason I bring up the blanket bombing in Germany be because you be bemoan the iraqi civilian casualty as be so deplorable yet blanket bombing be institute because bomb was n't accurate enough to hit industrial   military target in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the Gulf War precision bombing be the norm so the point be why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualty that result   in spite of   precision bombing when so many more civilian proportionately and quantitatively die under the blanket bombing in WW2 even with precision bombing mistake happen and some civilian suffer but less civilian suffer in this war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilian go about their life with minimal interference from the ally air raid the story of hundred of thousand of iraqi civilian dead be just plain bunk yes bunk the US lose 230,000 serviceman in WW2 over four year and the majority of they be directly involve in fight but we be expect to swallow that hundred of thousand of   civilian   Iraqis die in a war last about 2 month and with the Allies use the most precise bomb ever create at that what hogwash if hundred of thousand of iraqi civilian die it be due to action Hussein take on his own people not due to the Allied bombing regard;0
1027;I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF and it usually work very well That be not my point i 'm   philosophically   oppose to it because of its complexity this complexity have lead to some programs poor tiff writer make some very bizarre file other programs inability to load tiff image though they 'll save they of course and a general inability to interchange image between different environment despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF as the saying go It 's not I I 'm worry about- it 's all the abuse of TIFF over the year and I chalk it all up to the immense and unnecessary complexity of the format in the word of the TIFF 5.0 spec Appendix G page g-1 capitalize emphasis mine the only problem with this sort of success be that TIFF be design to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity it take a fair amount of effort to handle all the option currently define in this specification probably no application do a COMPLETE JOB and that be currently the only way you can be   sure   that you will be able to import any TIFF image since there be so many image generating application out there now if a program or bad all application ca n't read   every   tiff image that mean there be some it won't- some that I might have to deal with why would I want my image to be trap in that format I do n't and neither should anyone who agree with my reasoning- not that anyone do of course;1

1041;excerpt from netnews.alt.atheism 15 Apr-93 Re thought on christians by Dave Fullerportal.hq.vi I think it 'd help if we get a couple good atheist or even some good steadfast agnostic in some high political office when be the last time we have an openly atheist president have we ever I do n't actually know- these are n't rhetorical question how 'bout some Supreme court justice one thing that really tick I off a while ago be an ad for a news program on a local station the promo say something like who be these cult and why do they prey on the young Ahem ever hear of baptism AT BIRTH if that is n't preying on the young I do n't know what be I use to be ack barf a Catholic and be even confirm shortly thereafter I decide it be a load of BS my mom who really insist that I continue to go to church feel it be her duty to bring I up as a believer that be one of the more presumptuous thing i 've hear in my life I suggest we go talk to the priest and she agree the priest be amazingly cool about it he basically say that if I did n't believe it there be no good in force it on I actually I guess he was n't amazingly cool about it his response be what you 'd hope for indeed expect from a human being I s'pose I just   did n't   expect it I find it absurd that religion exists- yet I can also see its usefulness to people face up to the fact that you 're just go to be worm food in a few decade and that there is n't some cosmic purpose to humanity and the universe can be pretty difficult for some people have a readily available pre digested solution to this be pretty attractive if you 're either a gullible enough b willing to suspend your reasoning ability for the piece of mind or c have have the stuff ram down your throat for as long as you can remember Religion in general provide a nice patch for some human weaknesses- organized religion provide a nice way to keep a population under control Blech Chris;0
1042;there be a couple of thing about your post and other in this thread that be a little confusing an atheist be one for whom all thing can be understand as process of nature exclusively this definition do not include all atheist see the FAQ however I for one do think there be no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanation it make a big difference to claim that all thing can be understand as natural process and to claim that our observation do not require we to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter human be not omnipotent and neither be science however science have one advantage theology does n't it be self- correct with nature as its judge it be delightful to see how scientific inquiry be reveal a self- consistent simple picture of our universe science be no long a bunch of separate branch it be one from particle physics to psychology and no aspect of our life or our universe be safe from its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there be no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there be no purpose or direction for any event beyond those require by physic chemistry biology etc.- everything be random nothing be determnine actually determinism vs. indeterminism be a philosophical question and science can not say whether the whole thing be actually somehow superdeterministic or not I think the question do not have any meaning as far as individual human being go if their apparent free will be an illusion it do not appear to be so from their perspective Bill can you say   for sure   whether you have a free will or not this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its product there be nothing require that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it 's just a happy accident maybe who be we to tell it seem intelligence be useful when during the history of Earth have   one specie   be able to control one third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of numerous happy accident our genetic machinery blindly replicate and preserve even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the system that can start replicate will survive those which do n't do n't make it recommend reading t.o for an atheist no event can be prefer to another or be say to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought -about- an event can have value from whose perspective I value event and thing subjectively from my perspective nature do not have value because it do not have a perspective value arise from awareness if I have a subjective perspective it be easy to assume that other people also do and if I think about what it would it be like in their position I will eventually discover the Golden Rule morality be not necessarily a gift from heaven in fact it may be a product of evolution perhaps we be aware of ourselves because a sense of identity be helpful allow we to play the role of other and make we respect other who seem to have identity too Bill have you ever read Aristotle try his Ethica Nikomakhea sp for starter how then can an atheist judge value what be the basis for criticize the value ennumerate in the Bible or the purpose impute to God on what ground can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemn it seem that in judge the value that motivate other to action you have to have some standard against which conduct be measure but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your value C.S. Lewis tell we that this argument be the main reason why he abandon his atheism and become Christian the argument be severely flawed some value such as the Golden Rule can have a rational basis some other like the basic idea of want to live have probably its root in the way our brain be wire Lewis ignore the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality as well indeed as human evolve well and well in building and use tool they also become well at kill each other it be a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who know how to use tool but not against one 's own people the Bible reveal quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews be not beyond this a simple set of rule to hold the people together under one god their god do not care much about people of other nation at the time of the NT thing be quite different the Jews be under rule of an   empire   and could no long simply ignore the Gentiles a new situation require a new morality and along with it a new religion be bear a mutation in a meme pool since every event be entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- do religious or otherwise there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour be to admit that the objection be entirely subjective and that he(she just does n't like it that 's it any value judgement must be preface by the disclaimer that it be nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carry no weight in any absolute sense it look like you have n't bother to read philosophy whenever there be an observer there be a subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that be just a result of some physical event and other 's happiness too if the observer come to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that is without any observer or subject moral judgment lose their meaning it be not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this include god too their value be only   their   personal judgment not absolute truth since such truth do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt other be a manifestation of the way we have fight for our existence by become social being who can think and value others existence Morality be not property of human alone chimp dolphin and many other specie show great care for each other dolphin have sometimes save human from drown a good deed indeed that you do n't like what God tell people to do say nothing about God or God 's command it say only that there be an electrical event in your nervous system that create an emotional state that your mind couple with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objection -seem- well found be due to the way you 've be conditioned- there be no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape be an illusion a virtual reality the last statement do not logically follow in fact there be every reason to believe our thought can model reality very well and our sense can convey reliable information solipsism be still a logical possibility but not a very likely one you be continuously mix two different view the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view   which do not exist   any observer or thinker any personal being have its own point of view it do not matter whether this point of view be a result of some physical event or not it do not cease to be subjective from a non observers non point of view value do not exist neither do pain or pleasure or beauty or love such thing be inherently subjective once again if god want wife to submit to their husband or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or want to punish we if we do n't I disagree with his moral I do not think my moral come from any supreme being to remove my moral mean the same than to make I a zombie a machine without a single thought if god give we morality to judge but I disagree with he it be not my fault he be free to replace my moral I can not see what be the point of give someone a moral system which disagree with one 's own and then to get mad at this God must be schizophrenic all of this be so you have exclude yourself from any discussion of value right wrong goood evil etc and can not participate your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter I can not understand why a subjective opinion of a thing make of matter be in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing make of something else Bill take note absolute value must be independent of   any   be   include   god if god have a subjective viewpoint it be his own point of view and his moral be his own Petri;0

1050;ideology also split give more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance so do you also oppose all ideology I do n't think your argument be an argument against religion at all but just point out the weakness of human nature I would like a reference if you have get one for this be news to I one must approach the Qur'an with intelligence any thinking approach to the Qur'an can not but interpret the above verse and other like it that woman and man be spiritual equal I think that the above verse do clearly imply that woman have soul do it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgive or to have a great reward understand to be in the after life I think the usual answer would be no in which case the part say for they have God prepare forgiveness and a great reward say they have soul if it make sense to say that thing without soul can be forgive then I have no idea   what   a soul be as for your say that the quote above may not be give a high priority in all interpretation any thinking approach to the Qur'an have to give all verse of the Qur'an equal priority that be because accord to muslim belief the   whole   Qur'an be the revelation of God in fact deny the truth of any part of the qur'an be sufficient to be consider a disbeliever in Islam look any approach to the Qur'an must be do with intelligence and thought it be in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran 's message in a book of finite length it can not explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teaching it can guide you I think however that woman be the spiritual equal of man be clearly and unambiguously imply in the above verse and that since woman can clearly be forgive and reward they   must   have soul from the above verse Let 's try to understand what the Qur'an be try to teach rather than try to see how many way it can be misinterpret by ignore this passage or that passage the misinterpretation of the Qur'an base on ignore this verse or that verse be infinite but the interpretation fully consistent be more limited Let 's try to discuss these interpretation consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that be just show how people can try to twist Islam for their own end something I do not deny but provide no reflection on the true teaching of Islam whatsoever;0

1082;ok here be at least one Christian 's answer Jesus be a JEW not a Christian in this context Matthew 5:14 19 make sense Matt 5:17 do not think that I   Jesus   come to abolish the Law or the Prophets- I do not come to abolish but to fulfill Jesus live under the jewish law however he be the culmination of the promise of the Prophets he come to   fulfill   the prophecy and fully obey god 's purpose Verse 18 say for truly I say to you until heaven and earth pass away not the small letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law until all be accomplish the key to this verse IMHO be the last phrase Jesus as the fulfillment of the law accomplish what the Law be suppose to accomplish Verse 19 whoever then annul one of the least of these commandment and so teach other shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven- but whoever keep and teach they he shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven take in the context of Jesus teach jewish people about live life under the law this make sense in general it appear that Jesus be respond to some criticism he must have receive about do away with the Law that be not Jesus intent at all he have come to earth to live the Law as it should be live and fulfill the promise make by God to his people all the way back to Eve   Gen 3:15 the serpent will bruise your heel but   he   will bruise his head   Jesus appear to be do away with the Law because he do not honor the tradition of man as equal to the Law of God he regularly lock horn with the religious leader of the day because he would not conform to   their   rule only god 's Law in the Matthew passage Jesus be defend his dedication to the Law and defend himself against his accusor almost the entire Sermon on the Mount Matt 5 7 be dedicate to help the jewish people understand the true intent of the Law sweep away the clutter which have be introduce by the Pharasees and their tradition in Galatians 3:23 26 Paul describe the relationship of Jesus to the Law in this way   23   but before faith come we be keep in custody under the law be shut up to the faith which be later to be reveal   24   therefore the Law have become our tutor to lead we to Christ that we may be justify by faith   25   but now that faith have come we be no long under a tutor   26   for you be all son of God through faith in Christ Jesus I believe this say that after Christ be reveal the Law have serve it 's purpose i.e. our tutor to lead we to Christ and now we be no long under a tutor the law have be fulfil as Christ say he would do God the author of the old Law and the Christ   Man Jesus be the same personality therefore the old Law and the new Testament the last will and testament of Jesus be base on the same moral principle it make sense that many of the principle in the old Law be re express in Christianity on the other hand now that the Law have fulfil it 's purpose and Christians relate to God through Christ not the Law it also make sense that new practice and new symbolism be establish to represent the mystery of this new relationship i.e. baptism represent Christ 's death burial and resurrection Rom 6:3 8) the lord 's supper as a memorial to his sacrifice I Cor 11:26 and Sunday as a day of worship commemorate his resurrection Matt 28:1ff act 20:7 ok That 's one christian 's explanation I do n't claim to have all these issue completely settle even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternative please excuse the long posting thank for your interest if you have read this far;3

1085;why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cut for example why could n't Magellan just be tell to go into a safe mode and stay bob about Venus in a low power use mode and if maybe in a few year if funding get restore after the economy get well hopefully it could be turn on again for that matter why exactly be the Apollo lunar experiment turn off rather than just safe be it political i.e. as along as they could be use someone would keep bug congress for fund turn they off keep they pesky scientist out of the bureaucrat 's hair I 've hear the argument that an active but uncontrolled spacecraft cause radio noise I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly design safe mode this safe mode could be a program routine which cause the spacecraft to go to least fuel use orientation and once a week month year whatever attempt a signal lock on Earth at that time if funding have be restore the mission can continue if no signal be recieve the spacecraft go back to the safe mode for another time period as we would know when the spacecraft be go to try to contact Earth we could be prepare if necessary as another a spacecraft could do at the attempt contact be beam store datum towards Earth if someone can receive it great if not so it 's lost and no big deal by make the time and signal location generally know perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the datum even if they 're not willing to contact the spacecraft I see this as be particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and be in or be go to place which be otherwise unaccessible Jupiter   Saturn Orbit exit the solar system etc perhaps those design future spacecraft Cassini Pluto Flyby etc should consider design in a pause mode in case their spacecraft get the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine write in for the post mission drift phase so any hole in all this;2

1132;okay I argue this thoroughly about 3 4 week ago man and woman be different physically physiologically and psychologically much recent evidence for this statement be present in the book Brainsex by Anne Moir and David Jessel I recommend you find a copy and read it their book be an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and be well reference now if woman and man be different in some way the law can only adequately take into account their need in these area where they be different by also take into account the way in which man and woman be different maternity leave be an example of this it take into account that woman get pregnant it do not give woman the same rule it would give to man because to treat woman like it treat man in this instance would be unjust this be just simply an obvious example of where man and woman be intrinsically different now people make the   naive   argument that sexism   oppression however maternity leave be sexist because MEN do not get pregnant man do not have the same access to leave that woman do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it be sexist no matter however much a man   want   to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can and therefore the law be sexist no man can have access to maternity leave no matter how hard he try to get pregnant I hope this be clear maternity leave be an example where a sexist law be just because the sexism here just reflect the sexism of nature in make man and woman different there be many other difference between man and woman which be far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book Brainsex your point that perhaps some day man can also be pregnant be fallacious if man can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become woman to have a womb and the other factor require for pregnancy be usually wrap up in the definition of what a woman be so your argument when it be examine be see to be fallacious you be say that man can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that woman can have if they also become woman which actually just support my statement that maternity leave be sexist there be no official priesthood in Islam much of this function be take by islamic scholar there be female islamic scholar and female islamic scholar have always exist in Islam an example from early islamic history be the Prophet 's widow Aisha who be recognize in her time and be recognize in our time as an islamic scholar you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religion and I dispute it I could go on and on about woman in Islam etc but I recently reposte something here under the head Islam and Women if it be still at your news site I suggest you read it it be reposte from soc.religion.islam so if it have disappear from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam I forgot what its original title be though I will email it to you if you like your statement that other religion be no different be I think a statement base simply on lack of knowledge about religion other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism Aisha who I mention early be not only an islamic scholar but also be at one stage a military leader the Prophet 's first wife who die just before the Hijra the Prophet 's journey from Mecca to Medina be a successful businesswoman Lucio you can not make a strong case for your viewpoint when your viewpoint be base on ignorance about world religion;0

1161;there be some recent development in the dispute about Masonry among Southern Baptists I post a summary over in bit.listserv.christia and I suppose that it might be useful here note that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follow I present it as information   for a short summary a southern Baptist name Larry Holly write a book claim that Freemasonry be a religion incompatible with Christianity Mr Holly 's father reject Christianity and Mr Holly blame that on the Masons the sbc 's Home Missions Board include an interfaith witness department which study other religion and how to teach they about Christ a few year ago they be order to produce a report on Masonry they conclude that it be not a religion and therefore be outside their speciality however Mr Holly lead a movement of people who oppose Masonry and last year the Convention again order the HMB to study Masonry I get the feeling that they be say you get the wrong answer last time try to do well and get the answer we want anyway there 's be a bit of infighting and some inappropriate action but the dust have settle and the report be in nobody be entirely happy with it but everybody seem willing to live with it both side be say thing such as this be the good we be go to get in the current environment the report commend the Masons for the charity work they do such as the hospital and burn center they operate as well as effort to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse the report acknowledge that many well- know Christians be and have be Masons and note that many teaching of Masonry be supportive of christian faith and practice example of the latter include belief in God emphase on honesty and integrity and that some masonic lodge incorporate explicit christian belief on the other hand they note that some aspect of Masonry be incompatible with southern baptist principle these include the use of title which some people consider sacrilegious the taking of certain oath even though they be not mean seriously the undeniably pagan andor occultic writing of some masonic leader the implication in some masonic writing that salvation can be achieve by good work and the racial discrimination practice by many masonic lodge I note with some chagrin that baptist church as a whole are n't really in a place to speak on this last point the report conclude that Masonry be not a religion and say that membership should not be endorse or censure but leave to the discretion of individual this be in part because there be variation among different Masonic Lodges and while one may include element strongly against Christianity another may not many southern Baptists have strong conviction about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church and this history probably influence how the report come out   the information above be glean from the Religious Herald a publication of the Baptist General Association of Virginia and Baptists Today which do not have any direct link to a religious organisation autonomy be a big issue among some Baptists 8-) because I have neither the report itself nor whatever Masonic document be relevant to these issue none of the above come with a guarantee your mileage may vary Void where prohibit Darren F Provine   kilroygboro.rowan.edu Milton we use only the fine baby frog dew pick and fly from Iraq cleanse in fine quality spring water lightly kill and then seal in a succulent swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frost with glucose;3

Knies   isscckbyuvm.b    as a latter day Saint I find John 's statement   not at all   ludicrous      please allow I to explain myself in 1838 the governor of Missouri    governor Boggs issue his so call Mormon extermination order the    only crime illegal activity the latter day saint have commit be    their religious affiliation their anti slave stance Missouri still    allow slave practice and their grow number   influence in Missouri      I guess the Mormons get what they deserve because they refuse to bow    to the will of corrupt and evil secular authority this disobedience    bring upon they persecution murder and finally force expulsion from    their land and settlement    it be significant to remember that these secular position be hold by   average people and that at the time almost all Americans be pretty   homogeonously Christian it be largely the mainstream christian 's disgust   at such practice as polygamy which result in their irrational hatred true but that be exactly the problem the Mormon extermination order be issue not just by a Christian it be ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States which be institute precisely to prevent incident like this order from occur in the first place as I indicate in an early posting your irrational hatred be clearly evidence by individual like Robert Weiss who could have be Gov. Boggs Lieutenant- he would have fit right in drewle et al and seem a modern day occurrence base on result slander persecution misrepresentation lie deny Mormons representation in their own user group etc etc in intent and purpose what really have change   the situation be not entirely different today many irrational feeling   and belief be justify through religion I do n't think most of they   be start because of religion but religion certainly help justify and   perpetuate prejudice and practice by provide a neat justification   which discourage critical thought true as evidence by numerous example as I be sure you 're aware    in any regard Mormon history alone indicate that secular authority and    I do n't even discuss how Uthan 's be suckere into allow part of their    land in become nerve gas and atomic bomb testing ground be far from    be trust or righteous have thing really change for the well I    may be a bear cynic but I have no reason whatsoever that such have be the    case in the early 1980 I believe the late President Kimball lds church    leader strongly protest federal attempt to locate the MX Peace Keeper    missile maze from be build in Utah yet another inspire decision from   secular authority fortunately his opposition be influential enough   for the fed to back off    do you mean that the secular authority be some continuous group of   people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrasse   eradicate the   Mormons do you honestly believe that the main reason for use Utah for   nuclear testing etc be to get they thar mormon and what about the   majority of Uthan 's who are n't Mormons you seem to be search for enemy   Correction the majority of Utahn 's ARE Mormon 60 70 I believe up to a 100 in many city and settlement throughout the western state   conspiracy it be paranoid to believe that everything that affect you   badly must have be do primarily for that purpose what I mean be that secular authority be to be watch as we believe that Satan have be give some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth judgment and justice in addition we believe that the adversary have power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and evil combination as an intelligent being do n't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power as far as Utah be concern what I point out be some horrible example of environmental nightmare impose upon by secular authority which have bring death disease i.e. the downwinder and environmental contami- nation I be hardly paranoid I be just not expect too much from a secular government that may not share our value and faith and which indeed as Gov. Boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy we as a matter of fact prophecy in my church indicate that in future year global persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope that paraphrase all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to Zion Zion the pure in heart will be re establish in those day and it ai n't our current secular authority who will rule over it    David Koresh do not pose a great    threat to the federal authority or the security of this nation and with    John I too wonder who or what 's next    I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who be a threat to the   life of even one person sure he do not pose a threat to the security of   this nation but he do pose a threat to the life of his follower that   much be definite Hmmm definite by whom --Until such have be establish beyond reason- able doubt this allege threat may have be less than the threat impose upon he and his follower by the BATF and FBI    who kill who what constitutional right do the ATF officer have to    invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound    what REALLY cause the murder of the little child could it be that    the ATF   FBI presence have any bearing upon the event how would you    interpret the Mt.

archived copy for the most up to date information on upcoming mission call 407 867 INFO 867 4636 at Kennedy Space Center Official NASA shuttle status report be post to sci.space.news frequently why do the SHUTTLE ROLL just after liftoff the following answer and translation be provide by Ken Jenks kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov the Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual ASC GC 2102 tdure the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude be tcommande until an i load V(rel sufficient to assure launch tower tclearance be achieve then the tilt maneuver roll program torient the vehicle to a head down attitude require to generate a tnegative q alpha which in turn alleviate structural loading other tadvantages with this attitude be performance gain decrease abort tmaneuv complexity improve S band look angle and crew view of tthe horizon the tilt maneuver be also require to start gain tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff MECO target tin second stage this really be a good answer but it 's couch in NASA jargon I 'll try to interpret 1)twe wait until the Shuttle clear the tower before roll 2)tThen we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack tbetween the wind cause by passage through the atmosphere the trelative wind and the chord of the wing the imaginary line tbetween the leading edge and the trail edge be a slightly tnegative angle a negative q alpha).tthis cause a little bit of tdownward force toward the belly of the Orbiter or the   z tdirection and this force alleviate structural loading twe have to be careful about those wing they 're about the tmost delicate part of the vehicle 3)tthe new attitude after the roll also allow we to carry more tmass to orbit or to achieve a high orbit with the same mass or tto change the orbit to a high or low inclination than would be tthe case if we did n't roll performance gain 4)tthe new attitude allow the crew to fly a less complicated tflight path if they have to execute one of the more dangerous abort tmaneuvers the Return to Launch Site decrease abort maneuver tcomplexity 5)tthe new attitude improve the ability for ground base radio tantennae to have a good line of sight signal with the S band radio tantennae on the Orbiter improve S band look angle 6)tthe new attitude allow the crew to see the horizon which be a thelpful but not mandatory part of pilot any fly machine 7)tthe new attitude orient the shuttle so that the body be tmore nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east t(usually this allow the thrust from the engine to add velocity tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember tvelocity be a vector quantity make of both speed and direction tthe Shuttle have to have a large horizontal component to its tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all beg the question why is n't the launch pad orient to give this nice attitude to begin with why do the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer be that the pad be leftover from the Apollo day the Shuttle straddle two flame trench one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust you can see the effect of this on any daytime launch the SRM exhaust be dirty gray garbage and the SSME exhaust be fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top   orbiter side   and the bottom   External Tank side   of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure be all orient basically the same way they be for the Saturn V 's a side note the Saturn V 's also have a roll program do n't ask I why I 'm a Shuttle guy I check with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.tHe add that the roll maneuver be really a maneuver in all three axis roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver be perform for the reason state the pitch component control loading on the wing by keep the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component be use to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver be really express as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combine all three rotation matrix in one four element array how to receive the NASA tv CHANNEL NASA

1356;I will clarify my early quote god 's law be originally write for the Israelites Jesus change that fact by now make the Law applicable to all people not just the Jews gentile could be part of the kingdom of heaven through the save grace of God I never say that the Law be make obsolete by Jesus just for reference here be the early quote Malcolm Lee mleepost.RoyalRoads.ca write in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20 25 these law write for the Israelites God 's choose people whom God have expressly set apart from the rest of the world the Israelites be a direct witness to God 's existence to disobey God after know that God be real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable remember these law be write for a different time and apply only to God 's choose people but Jesus have change all of that we be live in the age of grace sin be no long immediately punishable by death there be repentance and there be salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ and not just for a few choose people Salvation be available to everyone Jew and gentile alike these be two conflicting statement to say one be a clarification of the other be a breach of logic I do n't mind people shift their position on an issue it irritate I when it be say under the premise that no change be make what about Deuteronomy 22:20 25 be it wrong now do Jesus change that if anything he clarify the Law such as in that quote you make in the follow verse Jesus take several portion of the Law and expound upon the Law give clear meaning to what God intend sure he do this however he does n't address the notion of stone non virgin bride because this need no clarification be you go to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20 25 be not patently clear in its intent I think you will agree with I that there be in today 's world a lot of modern day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it what good be head knowledge if there be nothing in the heart I 'll agree that there be a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and do n't believe in it depend on how they use this knowledge they can be scary they can argue any position they desire and back it up with select part of the Bible such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler I will qualify this by say   I do n't know   if they actually believe what they be preach but the end certainly make the mean look frightening however just as scary be those that do n't know much of the Bible but believe every word in fact this be probably scarier since there be far more of these people from what I 've see in addition they be very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees since they do n't know enough to debate with these people Christianity be not just a set of rules- it 's a lifestyle that change one 's perspective and personal conduct and it demand obedience to God 's will no it demand obedience to a book if God come down and personally tell I how I should behave then I would say that I would be do God 's will by do it however if preacher pastor and evangelist tell I to obey the will of a book write by people who have be dead for close to two millenia even long for the OT even if I follow everything in it with my heart I could scarcely be honest with myself by say I 'm do the will of God some people can live by it but many other can not or will not that be their choice and I have to respect it because God respect it too well if God respect it so much how come there be talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non believer I see little respect eminating from the god of the Bible I see a selfish and spiteful god God be with you not your thank Malcolm Lee Rob Lanphier lanphi872snake.cs.uidaho.edu lanph872uidaho.edu and for the curious here be my early post;3
1357;it be good to remember that every translation be to some extent an interpretation so as you point out below one must really go back to the original Arabic regard the verse relevant to nature I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille 's translation in his book the Bible the Qur'an and Science for in general his translation be more literal Maurice Bucaille translate the portion of the verse you be address as each one be travel with an orbit in its own motion also note that the celestial body in the first translation quote by you above be the translator 's interpolation it be not existent in the original Arabic which be why it be include in bracket You 're right what the verse   do   contain is n't all that remarkable however Dr. Bucaille a surgeon that be how he be a Dr. think it be significant that the above verse contain no geocentric idea even though geocentrism be all the rage up until the 17th century or so and this go for the rest of the Qur'an as well which have about 750 verse or so regard nature I think I remember read once;0
1358;well let see I take a class on this last fall and I have no note so I 'll try to wing it Here be how I understand it remember from stellar evolution that black hole and neutron stars(pulsars be form from high mass star M(star)1.4M(sun high mass star live fast and burn hard take appoximately 10   5 10   7 year before go nova or supernova in this time they do n't live long enough to get perturb out of the galactic plane so any of these if assume to be the source of GRB 's will be in the plane of the galaxy then we take the catalog of burst that have be recieve from the various satellite around the solar system Pioneer Venus have one either Pion 10 or 11 GINGA and of course BATSE and we do distribution test on our catalog these test all show that the burst have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show sign of homogeneity i.e. they do not clump in any one direction so unless we be sample the area inside the disk of the galaxy we be sample the UNIVERSE not cool if you want to figure out what the hell cause these thing now I suppose you be say well we stil only may be sample from inside the disk well not necessarily remember we have what be more or less an interplanetary network of burst detector with a baseline that go waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11 so we should be able with all of our detector de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite Here be an analogy you see a plane overhead you measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system one of your friend a mile away see the same plane and measure the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system which be the same as your the two angle be different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe find a source to my knowledge no one have be able to do this I should throw in why halo and corona model do n't work also as I say before look at the possible astrophysic of the burst short timescale high energy black hole and pulsar exhibit much of this type of behavior if this be the case as I say before these star seem to be bind to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these source when you look at a simulated model where the burst be confine to the disk but you sample out to large distance say 750 mpc you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clumping of source in the direction of the galactic center as I say before there be none of these characteristic;2

1401;what an exciting thread finally Mitra be Sanskrit for Friend as such he start out as an avatar of Lord Visnu mention first in the Vedas later he seem to have rise to chief prominence worship by the Persians associate with the Sun but not the Sun he be the lord of contract honor and obedience therefore naturally worship by soldier he be order by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and he reluct- antly agree because of his obligation the blood of that bull spill and grow all earth life then Mitra and the Sun sit down to eat worship of Lord Mitra end in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians hundred of year later he be rediscover and throw into the official Roman Pantheon tm for some semi tricky reason I forget why but all reference of he end abruptly when he be stricken from same so apparently his worship be some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy like membership in the Communist Party be in the Soviet Bloc the sociology of religion in ancient time be fascinating oh his b day be 25 Dec.

1411;Mr DeCenso in spite of require scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas reject that the scholarly opinion of the those scholar and then rephrase those scholar opinion on the subject and actually if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will find that it do denote success those scholar do indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide be successful as I point out I recently check several Lexicons tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament Louw and Nida tRobinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament tgreek English Lexicon of the New Testament Grimm tWord study Concordance Tynsdale tA Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other t early Christian Writings Bauer Arndt Gingrich tThe New Analytical Greek Lexicon Perschbacher a couple simply state hang oneself and a couple be more explicit and state that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hang a couple also note that the meaning of one the root word for apacgw be strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidate the guy who suggest to David Joslin that Judas be hang upside down one of the good reference though Robinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament not only state the translation it give both the root word the literal translation relate greek word which use the same root and also other present specific example of the word in greek literature to give further context the word apagchw have two root word gchw be the to strangle root and the root word apo mean literally away this root word be include in word which denote a transition it can mean a transition in place eg the greek word apagello mean to send a message Apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death Robinson specifically make comparison to the word apokteiuo which mean to kill in literal meaning the word apacgw mean to throttle strangle to put out of the way and implicitly denote a change in life state ie away from life to death so while the word apacgw do mean to hang it specifically denote a death as well thus Robinson be quite specific when he state that it mean to hang oneself to end one 's life by hang he then note the the use of apacgw in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context he present that example of apacgw as be use to explicitly mean suicide by hang now since there be a perfectly good word for strangle without the add denotation of death and as you insist that the Bible be write by God and every word be precicely correct you be stick with the complete meaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw be use then death be denote as the result by the way I note that Mr DeCenso also present an example of apacgw note Mr DeCenso as you say the septuagint be a translation from Hebrew to Greek and you have not show the original meaning of the Hebrew ie the the Hebrew say and die and thus whether it be simply echo in the Greek it should also be point out that regardless of the add and die the correct translation would still be apacgw as the man do indeed die from strangulation redundant but correct far we have evidence that the septuagint be repeatedly rewrite and reedite which include version which contradict each other and such editing be not even necessarily execute by Greeks thus I be not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stand as a paragon of ancient greek so what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso be an example in ancient greek of someone commit apacgw and survive otherwise I would see you as simply make worthless assertion without correspond evidence now I would note Mr DeCenso that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrive exegisis I pretty much find it false thus I think that if you be go to add to the text something over and above what the source clearly say then you have well have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it by the way as to Mr Rose 's statement about tree around the potter 's field unless Mr Rose can show that these tree be two thousand year old or that there be 2000 year old stump there or have a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mention such tree then it be inappropriate for he to assert that the present placement of tree prove the location of the tree two thousand year ago after all thing change now as to your other argument ie that the money Judas use be not the same as the 30 silver true Peter or the author of act do not specifically call Judas betrayal an iniquity but for that matter neither do John specifically call Judas action an iniquity either Further John 13:29 do not say that Judas take some think that because Judas have the money box Jesus be tell he buy what we need for the feast- or that he should give something to the poor so after receive the morsel he immediately go out and it be night note that it be say that Judas leave it do not say that he take the money box thus when I see your explanation it still seem to I you would choose the a an unproven iniquity mention by another author in a different book write at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mention by the author of act I find this force and contrive of course this particular argument become moot since we have have see evidence that apacgw mean suicide you see since Judas hanging be successful he could not have spend the money mention in John 13:29 because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal be on the high holy day ie Passover and thus he could not have spend the money before kill himself the next day thus the money which buy the Field of blood would have to have be the 30 piece of silver of course he get the 30 piece of silver that night as well and thus could n't have spend that either oh dear I believe that the house of card be comme down maybe we should at this point discuss now whether Jesus be crucify on Friday or Saturday as that be now part of the argument about Judas by the way as to where the prophesy of the potter 's field come from ie the mention of it in Matthew you say I be remind you now to discuss it now It 's all part of the same verse we be discuss and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestep these issue ttttLater ttttDave Butler tA wise man proportion his belief to the evidence ttttDavid Hume Philosopher ttttAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding;3

the christian religion and judge it accord to its claim it be important to look at its claim at fulfil early jewish prophecy the scribe Matthew be perhaps the most eager to draw out what he think be prophetic answer in the career of Jesus of Nazareth as you will see Matthew 's main strategy be to take various Old Testament passage often not even about the promise Messiah and apply they to the circumstance in the New Testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the account since the gospel be write at least 35 year after Jesus be execute we do not know how much happen exactly as state but for purpose of analysis we will take particular claim at face value Immanuel we begin of course at the beginning Mt 1.21 22   Mary   will bear a son and you Joseph will name he Jesus which mean G'd be salvation for he will save his people from their sin all this happen to fulfil what the lord have speak by a prophet   Isaiah 7.1 16   in the day of Ahaz c. 750 BCE king of Judah Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel make war on Jerusalem capitol of Judah but could not quite conquer it when the house of David i.e. Ahaz and his court in Judah be tell of this its heart and the heart of its people shake and the lord G'd say to Isaiah go to meet with Ahaz and the lord speak to Ahaz through prophet Isaiah naturally say ask a sign of G'd your lord it can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven but Ahaz say I wo n't ask- I will not put the lord to a test then Isaiah say hear then o house of David be it not enough for you to weary man that you must weary my god too therefore the lord himself will give you a sign Behold a young woman be with child and will bear a son and name he Immanuel which mean G'd be with we he will eat curd and honey when he know how to refuse evil and choose good for before the child know how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two king you dread will have be desert Matthew home in on just the sentence that be in italic far he the hebrew word almah young woman as specifically virgin but this be not a prophecy about the Messiah it be not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 year later it be not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about Jesus Matthew have make use of a verse out of context and try to make it fit the specific case of Mary it should be note that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be make to fit Mary Mary virgin or not be indeed a young woman with child of course the fit be shady and have problem Jesus while think of by late Christians to be g'd walk among man be never call by the name Immanuel if Christianity wish to claim this prophecy for Jesus it become at good a cut and paste prophecy a second class prophecy not too convincing Egypt after Jesus 's birth in Bethlehem Matthew tell about a quick and elsewhere unmentione excursion to Egypt as if he wish to liken Jesus to Moses this be do to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king Herod   Mt 2.15   and remain there until the death of Herod this be to fulfil what the lord have speak out of Egypt I have cal lead my son what the lord really say be this   Hosea 11.1   when Israel be a child I love he and out of Egypt I call my son the more I call they my people the more they go from me- they keep sacrifice to the Ba'als and keep burn incense to idol Matthew conveniently omit the rest of Hosea 's oracle but it be indeed Israel that once call out of Egypt want to return this be history Jesus be certainly not be speak of here and if we be to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a Jesus that flee and resist G'd again this prophecy be just not as convincing as Matthew probably have hope Rachel weep while Jesus be off vacation in Egypt Matthew say that King Herod seek to kill he and thus order the execution of all young male child Matthew then write   Mt 2.17 18   by this that which be speak by the prophet Jeremiah be fulfil a voice be hear in Ramah wail and loud lamentation-- Rachel weep for her children- she refuse to be console because they be no more the reference be to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15 refer to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon of Assyria in 722 BCE Rachel the ancestor of the major tribe of Israel Ephraim and Manasseh be say to weep for her descendant who be no more it be metaphorical of course since Rachel live and die before the Hebrews be even in the egyptian exile it be interesting to note that it be Leah not Rachel who be the ancestor of the Judeans the land where Jesus and Bethlehem be if anyone should do weep for her child it be Leah the only connexion that Rachel have with Bethlehem be that the legend have it that she be bury north of the city on the way to Ephrath Bethlehem as for Herod and his infanticide it be rather unlikely that such an event actually occur one never know but the event be not mention or allude to anywhere else in the Bible nor be it mention in any of the secular record of the time Herod be particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deed of Herod be carefully record this might be a prime example of how event be add to Jesus 's life to enhance the message of the church 's gospel because of the whole story 's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt it be highly likely that it be a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of Jesus it be not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglect to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote the child the prophet speak of be not dead but exile in the Assyrian Empire G'd comfort the weep Rachel say that the child will be returned-- he will gather they back together of course this would not suit Matthew 's purpose as the child he speak of be dead for good again the prophecy Matthew set up be not even that and to anyone who bother to check it out be not too convincing the Nazarene we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy after leave Egypt Joseph   wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth   Mt 2.23   that what be speak of by the prophet might be fulfil he shall be call a Nazarene first thing we notice be that Matthew do not mention the name of the prophet(s this time second we have to ask who he be there be no messianic prophecy speak of a Nazarene bad there be no prophecy period mention a Nazarene still bad there be no Nazarenes mention in the Old Testament at all in the book of Judges an angel tell Samson 's mother that she will   judge 13.5   conceive and bear a son no razor shall tough his head for he will be a Nazirite to his god from the day of his birth he will deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines this be of course not a prophecy of Jesus or the messiah of G'd but it be the good that can be find obviously Matthew have begin to go overboard in cut and paste prophecy in that he be simple make they up now bear our disease Jesus next go around heal people of physical illness and disability   Mt 8.17   this be to fulfil what be speak by the prophet Isaiah he take our infirmity and bear our disease as expect the verse quote in Isaiah be quote out of context and a few word be skewed to fit the christian scheme we have   be 53.4   surely he   the suffering servant   have bear our sickness and carry our pain from a reading of the surround passage in Isaiah we know that the prophet be speak in present tense of the collective nation of Israel Jehovah 's choose servant and people he speak to the Israelites suffer in exile in the voice of the gentile nation that look upon it this image be deeply ingrained in jewish identity --an image of a chastised yet cherish Israel as the instrument of the nations salvation by G'd the verse speak of Israel take on the sickness which be the literal and metaphorical manifestation of guilt and discipline they do not speak of a servant go around and heal people notice that the servant in Isaiah take on the sickness and pain of the nation and individual Jews Jesus as we all know do not take the disease onto himself the verse here in Isaiah be not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that have already happen while it be believe that Jesus take on the eternal punishment of hell he do not bear the illness he heal so while someone might want to say that figuratively Jesus reenact the deed of Israel in his spiritual atonement he have to admit that Matthew 's parallel miss where he intend it to have its effect Silent Messiah upon heal multitude of commoner it be say that Jesus order they to keep quiet presumable so that he would n't arouse the attention of the local ruler   Mt 12.15 21   this be to fulfill what be speak by the prophet Isaiah Behold my servant whom I have choose my beloved with whom my soul be pleased I will put my spirit on he and he will announce justice to the Gentiles he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the street he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smolder wick until he bring justice to victory and the gentile will hope in his name the Isaiah passage quote read   be 42.1 4   behold my servant whom I uphold my choose in whom my soul delight I have put my spirit on he and he will bring forth justice to the nation we will not cry or lift up his voice or make it hear in the street he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smolder wick he will faithfully bring forth justice he will not fail burn dimly or be discourage bruised until he have establish justice in the earth and the coastland await his law you see Matthew have conveniently leave out part of the passage because it do not suit the dealing of Jesus Christians could never think of Jesus fail never would the light of mankind burn dimly but the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job be do when the gentile come to embrace G'd there will no long be a choose people but rather all will be the child of G'd also the end phrase have be change from the Judaic the coastland await his law to the Christologic the Gentiles will hope in his name while the original proclaim the Torah law of Jehovah the other rewrite it to fit its strange doctrine of believe in the name if one have any doubt the servant refer to be not Jesus one have only to read the whole chapter Isaiah 42 and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people rob and plunder so we see that when Matthew 's attempt at prophecy be examine it crumble three Days and Three Nights now we come upon a prophecy supposedly utter by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself he speak of his crucifixion and resurrection   Mt 12.40   for as Jonah be in the belly of the whale for three day and three night so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three day and three night before any further discussion can occur it be necessary to know how the Jews understand day as far as day name go each be 24 hour long last from sunset 6 pm to the follow sunset 6 pm what be refer to as a day be the period of light from 6 am to the end sunset at 6 pm thus accord to our time scale a sabbath day begin at 6 pm Friday evening and last until 6 pm saturday evening this be why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays instead of Sundays it seem like a real miracle that Christians did n't forget that Saturday be indeed the seventh and last day of the week thus when day and night be refer to together 12 hour daylight portion and 12 hour night period be be speak of thus Jesus say that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three day and three night as the good book tell we Jesus be crucify on the ninth hour which be 3 pm Friday afternoon he then be put into the grave sometime after that then Jesus leave the grave rise before dawn of what we call Sunday the dawn after the sabbath be over what this mean be that Jesus be use our time for clarity in the grave from 6 pm Friday night to some time before 6 am Sunday morning we could also add a little time before 6 pm Friday since the bible be not specific here what this mean use jewish time be that he be in the grave for one day two night and possibly a couple of hour of one day certainly this be a problem for Jesus prediction there be absolutely no way we be even able to have his death involve three day and three night --even use modern time measurement we then be lead to suspect that this error be another one of Matthew 's little mistake and that the gospel writer put false word into his god 's mouth and no matter who make the prediction it be more than unconvincing it be counter convincing Hearing   Understanding Jesus tool on a habit of speak to his vast audience in parables-- story in which a deep meaning could be find if you be already one of the elect those choose to understand the message of Jesus he reason that those who can understand the parable be the one he want if the people can not understand they there be no need to bother with they since they will not accept the plain message any well Matthew say   Mt 13.14 16   with they   the audience   indeed in fulfil the prophecy of Isaiah which say you will indeed hear but never understand- and you will indeed see but never perceive because this people 's heart have grow dull their ear be heavy of hearing and they have shut their eye so the they would not perceive with they she with their ear and understand with their heart and turn for I to heal they the original Isaiah passage be part of his early work his call to the ministry this be in 740 BCE when Israel be flourish right before it fall under the authority of Assyria Isaiah see the good time end and also a vision from G'd call he to bring reform to Israel and Judah   be 6.9 13   and G'd say go and say to this people   hear and hear but do not understand- see and see but do not perceive make the heart of this people fat make their ear heavy and shut their eye so they will not see with their eye or hear with their ear and understand with their heart and turn and be heal then Isaiah say how long lord and he say until the city lie waste without inhabitant and house without man and the land be utterly desolate and the G'ds take man far away and forsake place be many in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burn again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stand when the tree be fell the holy seed be its stump here we see that it be really G'd who cause the people of Israel to stop listen to the prophet 's warning but reaffirm the promise make to Solomon 's and David 's seed   lineage if you read the rest of Isaiah you find that this be do to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant a light to the nation look at Isaiah 42.18 25 48.20 49.3 we see that Matthew have cut and paste just a little portion of Isaiah 's verse to suit his own gospel need More than that he have alter the word to make it fit the people who did n't understand Jesus 's story and as we see Isaiah 's verse be not prophecy but rather command from G'd to he in the present once again Matthew 's prophecy fall flat on its face Matthew try again to make Jesus 's parable look like they have the prophetic approval   Mt 13.35   he say nothing to they without a parable this be to fulfil what be speak of by the prophet I will open my mouth to they in parable I will utter that which have be hide since the foundation of the world Matthew really botch up here he attempt to quote not from a prophet but from the Psalms   Ps 78.2 4   I will open my mouth in parable I will utter dark saying of old thing that we all have hear and know thing that our father have tell we we will not hide they from their child but tell to the come generation the glorious deed of the lord as be point out the verse in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet you might also want to know that early copy of Matthew 's gospel even insert Isaiah 's name as this prophet apparently later scribe catch the error and try to cover some of it up perhaps the most significant part of this be that once again Matthew have alter the Old Testament scripture as Jesus have say early he speak in parable so that some will not understand they the parable in the Psalms be not to be hide far they speak of thing know that our father have tell we Jesus deal with thing hide since the foundation of the world indeed Jesus deal in a lot of secrecy and confusion this be in direct opposition to the parable in the Psalms no wonder Matthew have to rewrite they and still once again Matthew 's artificial prophecy fall flat on their face but Christians rarely look at this Matthew 's prophecy are n't the only thing about Christianity that be begin to look bad excuse of Little Faith in Mt. 17.14 21 we see that the disciple be able to go around cast out demon except in one case not know what epilepsy be the people think those with the disease be possese with demon it be no wonder that the disciple be unable to dispossess the epileptic but Jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they be report to have rebuke they say they did n't have enough faith this seem strange why be this demon special it seem that either a true believer have faith or he do not apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountain of course you will find no one these day that can move real mountain no one part sea the only miracle the Charismatics can speak of be those rumour to happen on trip to Mexico or some faraway place major miracle be make some old woman 's arthritis feel well on Sunday morning T.V. and the god include Jesus be always shroud in ancient lore and writing protect from the skeptic in their sacred past they be either dead sleeping or hide in heaven with people rumour about their imminent return and their great miracle of day long go yet life go on tale of mystic story of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place god use to reveal themselves to man in the old day Jehovah too but now they be silent all the theologian give be various excuse as to why we do n't get to see God anymore we 're too lazy- we 're not zealous enough- we 're sinful- it 's just his plan- we put too many of our own demand on G'd 's appearance- if we have the right faith if we be willing to meet G'd on his term yet even the most pious of man have not see G'd you dear reader have not see G'd not literally you know that to be true I know that be presumptuous and bold but search your heart you know what I mean all that we 've see religion do be make people feel good and content about not see G'd they say our little faith do not merit we to see G'd sometimes they say see the love in these people you worship with see the life of people change that be see G'd thus people get lull to sleep satisfied with turn G'd into the everyday sight but that be not see G'd as I be speak of it be not see G'd the way people use to see what we see in the world that be good be the compassion of human heart the love give and take by man and woman the forgiveness practise by Christian   Atheist alike beauty create by the mind of man these be the thing that be done- these be what we see but it be say this be so only because everybody have little faith Jesus ride on an Ass shortly after accept the role of the jewish messiah king Jesus request a donkey be bring in for he to ride into Jerusalem   Mt 21.5   this take place to fulfil what be speak by the prophet say tell the daughter of Zion Behold your king be come to you humble mount on an ass and on a ass colt of course the passage quote from Zechariah 9.9 read a little differently Lo your king come to you- he be triumphant and victorious humble and ride on an ass on an ass- colt he will command peace to the nation there is n't all that much difference here except that Zechariah only involve one animal --an ass colt-- while Matthew read the poetic wording slightly differently thus he have Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass from Matthew 's version we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweat it to straddle two donkey this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma we find that in the account write early by St. Mark only the colt be call for and bring to Jesus this indeed fit the verse of Zechariah properly and show we that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verse he have bungle now exclude many respectable christian I have meet I have notice that while Christ be think to have ride on ass the situation be often reverse nowadays then enter the Jerusalem temple the priest be anger at people and youngster call Jesus the messiah but Jesus reply as we might expect Matthew to have do   Mt 21.16   have n't you read   out of the mouth of babe and suckling thou have bring perfect praise it be more likely that Matthew make this response up since Jesus be never one to point out such little prophetic thing and since as we might expect the quote be in error which seem to fit Matthew 's track record quite well we might ask Jesus or Matthew have n't you read for the source read   psalm 8.1 2   o yahweh our lord how majestic be your name in the whole world you whose glory be chant above the heaven by babe and infant you have found a bulwark against your foe to still the enemy and the avenger the passage hardly need comment there be no perfect praise speak of in the psalm and what praise be there be give to G'd not his messiah king and not Jesus as mention it seem to be just one more case of Matthew 's pen make up convenient prophetic scripture YHVH say to my lord Jesus be say to have ask from whom the promise jewish messiah king be to be descend the Jews agree-- it be king David but then Jesus counter by quote Psalms 110 the LORD say to my Lord sit at my right hand until I put your enemy under your foot take at face value Jesus be deny the necessity of davidic descent one assume he be in opposition to their answer of course the christian answer be that he agree but be try to make some hide point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah king It 's tempting to believe this if one be a Christian and not interested in matter of investigation but there be problem in Jesus 's time the psalm be think to be about the messiah and it be easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior we need only look at the scripture about the messiah to see that he be expect to be a great king bring the Jews to time even well than those under David 's rule of course the Jews listen have no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the Christians worship the problem lie in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus 's time have also make one must remember that there be various faction among the Jews often as a result of different expectation of the messiah king Jesus be apparently one of these adventist like his audience who think the messiah 's advent be imminent and who interpret Psalms 110 among other as be messianic what be the problem then Psalm 110 literally read YHVH 's utterance to my lord tsit at my right hand until I make your enemy your footstool YHVH send forth your mighty scepter from Zion rule in the midst of your foe your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountain you be a priest of the order of Melchizedek forever the word lord be often mistakenly capitalise by christian bible to denote divinity in this lord but in the Hebrew the word be adoni and no capitalisation exist adoni simply mean lord a generic term as we would use it it be use often in the scripture to refer to king and to g'd it be merely an address of respect there be nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refer either to divinity or to the messiah king that this be suppose to be write by David be not certain the title of the psalm translate to either a psalm of David or a psalm about David it seem fitting to assume it to be write by a court poet about David 's covenant and endorsement from G'd if the psalm have be write by David it be unlikely that he would be talk about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descend from David be not present in David 's age we have extensive tale of David 's doing and sayings-- none of which include any praise of a messiah many of the psalm show evidence of be write long after David be dead in time of the exile when G'd have put his show of favour for David 's kingdom on hold the description in the psalm fit David very well David be promise by G'd a rise to power victory over his enemy successful judgement among the nation he conquer he achieve the priesthood common to Melchizedek in be a righteous king enable to bless the people it all fit we do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone though here there be not artificial prophecy allude to though his use of the scripture be rather questionable still this event be common to the other gospel too so we let Matthew off a little more easily this time it be interesting to note though how Matthew dress up the event the early gospel of Mark tell the tale with Jesus simply speak to a crowd Matthew have the Pharisees who become the religious competition of an infant Christianity be the target of Jesus 's question as we might expect Matthew write that the event end up by embarrass the Pharisees such power be the pen Moses   Jesus have it together all along we leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo prophecy in John 's gospel the gospel story of John deserve special treatment because it seem to be so far remove from the real event of Jesus 's career as tell by even Matthew but for the moment we will just look at one verse the early church leader found a religion on the jewish hope of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promise make by G'd when construct the history of Abraham Moses write of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people while this be accomplish eventually under the rule of king David the Christians who come along later decide that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they expand on the promise preach about a heavenly kingdom   John 8.56   J.C. speak your father Abraham rejoice to see my day he say it and be glad it would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham but Abraham know nothing of Jesus or a messiah or anything Christian I have try and fail to find any event in the Old Testament which correspond to john 's little prophecy it be par for the course to see St. John make up Old Testament backing just like his forerunner Matthew many Christians know that their faith have many of its foundation in such fraud and it be surprising they still cle to it the potter 's Field we be tell that Jesus be betray while in Jerusalem by one of his follower Judas Iscariot Matthew write   Mt 27.5 10   and throw down the piece of silver in the temple   Judas   depart but the chief priest take the silver say it is n't lawful for we to put it in the treasury since it be blood money so they buy a potter 's field with it to bury stranger in then be fulfil what be speak by the prophet Jeremiah and they take the thirty piece of silver the price of he on whom a price have be set by some of the son of Israel and they give they for the potter 's field as the lord direct I this prophecy be an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture first Matthew have make a mistake regard the name of the prophet it be Zechariah who utter the verse which Matthew make use of   Zech 11.12 13   and they weigh out my wage thirty shekel of silver then YHVH say to I Cast they to the treasury --the lordly price at which I be pay off by they so I take the thirty shekel of silver and cast they into the treasury in the house of YHVH first of all the verse of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of G'd the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest choose to serve a function of preside over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another the word treasury have be replace by the King James Scholars with to the potter precisely because this make Matthew 's quote fit well but this be a blatant error the correct translation of the Hebrew be indeed treasury which also make perfect sense in Zechariah 's context whereas potter 's field be totally unrelated whether the mistranslation be intentional or not seem to be beyond speculation however give Matthew 's track record one find it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty of course Matthew would have ample reason for alter the text the thirty piece of silver match Judas 's situation and if as most Christians seem to be the reader be willing to disregard the contextual incongruity Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around however the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradict the situation with Judas and the high priest the high priest would not put the money in the treasury the worthless shepherd of Zechariah do exactly the opposite of course to the average Thursday Night Bible student the prophecy as present by Matthew would be take at New Testament face value to those Matthew 's work be convince enough wine vinegar   cast lot then Jesus be lead away to be crucify   Mt 27.34 35   they give he vinegar to drink mingle with gall- but when he taste it he would not drink it and when they have crucify he they divide his garment among they by cast lot that it might be fulfil what be speak by the prophet they part my garment among they and upon my vesture do they cast lot first of all the vinegar offer to Jesus be actually common sour wine of the type that roman soldier drink regularly we find that right before Jesus die the soldier themselves give he some to drink --not pollute with gall   Jn 19.28 30   Jesus say I thirst a bowl of vinegar stand there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and hold it to his mouth when he have receive the vinegar he say it be finished- but Matthew seem to be draw on not a passage from the prophet but one from the Psalms   Ps 69.20 28   I look for pity but there be none- and for comforter but I find none they give I poison for food light they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they give I vinegar to drink add to they punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee let they be blot out of the Book of the living of course the sour wine offer to Jesus be do at his request of drink this do indeed seem to be a show of pity the psalm quote be about David and his political and military enemy it be not about the messiah or Jesus it be then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the Jesus in the psalm ask G'd for the damnation of the crucifier whereas the Jesus of the gospel say   lk 23.34   Jesus say Father forgive they the do n't know what they do far Matthew miss with his attempt to create prophecy by have gall a bitter substance put into Jesus 's drink not his meat as the psalm stipulate with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the casting of lot this bring up the 22nd Psalm which deserve discussion all by itself suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus 's clothe be divide as tell be no great thing it turn out that this happen often to any felon in those day as we will soon see it be perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when apply to Jesus it do indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus 's clothe for a man so removed from worldly possession his ownership of clothe worthy of cast lot raise some suspicion the 22nd Psalm this psalm be attribute to David as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemy it become a song of praise to YHVH and of hope take out of context part of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary passage Verse 1 2 my god my god why have you forsake I why be you so far from help I far from the word of my groaning oh my god I cry by day but you do n't answer and by night but find no rest Jesus be say to have cry the first sentence while on the cross this suggest that the whole psalm be really about Jesus rather than king David of course the rest of the first stanza do not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution Jesus be not picture as complain about the whole ordeal he be suppose to be like the lamb lead mute before its shearer indeed Jesus does n't do much groaning even when on the cross he certainly do not cry by both day and night on the cross 6 8 but I be a worm and no man-- scorn by man all who see I mock at I they make face and wag their heads- he commit his cause to YHVH so let he deliver he for he delight in he this seem to fit Jesus 's execution pretty well with the exception of the Holy messiah be call a worm 12 13 many bull encompass I they open their mouth widely at I like a ravening and roar lion 16 18 Yea dog be round about I a company of evildoer encir cle I they have pierce my hand and foot I can see all my bone they divide my garment among they and cast lose for my raiment 19 21 but you YHVH be not far away deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save I from the mouth of the lion and my afflict soul from the horn of the wild bull it would seem quite convincing and I 'm sure the early christian father who write of this prophecy think so too unfortunately this prophecy have a fatal flaw the word have pierce really do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translation be 16 Yea dog be round about I a company of evildoer encircle I like the lion they be at my hand and foot in Hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierce differ by one phonetic character the word in the Hebrew text be literally like the lion ka'ari which make sense in the context and even far fit the animal imagery employ by the psalm writer it be convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to ka'aru but to add the need yet artificial weight to the prophecy this be just what the christian translator have choose to do while the correct translation do not eliminate the psalm from refer to Jesus its absence do not say much for the honesty of the translator apart from the erroneous verse 16 the psalm do not lend itself to Jesus so easily Verse 20 speak of the sufferer be save from a sword rather than a cross this naturally fit the psalm 's true subject king David as a side note we now know that crucifixion do not pierce the hand the palm but rather the forearm this does n't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrect Jesus show his disciple the scar on his palm but then fact are n't bind by our religious belief Matthew escape culpability this time as he do not attempt to draw many direct link between this psalm and his lord Jesus but the psalm like many other be on the mind of all the gospel writer when they compile the story and interpretation of Jesus 's life and death how much these scripture may have contribute to what actually get write down be a question that have serious repercussion for christian theology it be easy to see for those who be not faithful fundamentalist how some of the event in the New Testament might have be enhance by scribe such as the eager Matthew but it do less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matter and prophetic claim so far this have not say good thing for St. Matthew the reference to the pierce look a lot like Jesus 's crucifixion john 's gospel recount write about 70 year after the fact tell we at Jesus 's execution   Jn 19.34,37   but one of the soldier pierce his side with a spear and out come blood and water these thing take place that scripture be fulfil the will look on he whom they 've pierce of course this be build on a passage take blatantly out of context Prophet Zechariah tell we how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with they   zc 12.7 10   and YHVH will give victory to Judah and on that day I will seek to destroy the nation that come against Jerusalem in Judah and I will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on Jerusalem so that when they look on he who they have pierce they will mourn and weep bitterly over he like you weep over a firstborn child john 's attempt to make up prophecy be perhaps weak that Matthew 's attempt Matthew at least usually excontext more than just one passage john 's error be grossly obvious and blatant here it do not speak well for any of the gospel writer as it help to show how the prophetic aspect of their religion be found reckon with transgressor after his arrest Jesus be quickly execute for claim the jewish kingship messiahship accord to one version of the gospel tale Jesus get execute along with two thief   Mk 15.27   and with he they crucify two robber one on his right one on his left and so the scripture be fulfil which say he be reckon with the transgressor here Mark be try to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53 about the servant nation of Israel the passage be not about the messiah for if one read the whole chapter of Isaiah 53 and its surround chapter one see that the servant be a nation the verse be also about what this servant have go through in the past not a prediction of what be to come in any event the servant be think of as a criminal this also happen to fit the description of Jesus have the passage really be about the messiah it still be not at all clear why execute Jesus between two thief would fulfill the prophecy in Isaiah Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he be consider a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career lock onto a single event be a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that Mark could have have make a well analogy with general comparison Mark go on to tell we how those who be crucify with   Jesus   also revile he   15.32   this be to be expect from a couple of robber of course in his later recount St. Luke decide to change some thing Luke tell we   lk 23.39 43   and one of the criminal who be hang with he rail Are n't you the messiah save yourself and we this certainly fit with Mark 's recount which tell how the people who crucify Jesus say save yourself and that the robber do the same but then Luke go on but the other   criminal   rebuke   the first   say do n't you fear G'd since you be under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we be receive the due reward for our deed but this man have do nothing wrong and he say Jesus remember I when you come in your kingdom and Jesus answer verily I say to you today you will be with I in paradise now this little dialogue seem highly contrived it stretch the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuke his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lament over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering such a man apparently noble and of principle does n't seem likely to have be a robber we wonder at the amount of theatric create by Luke of course Luke 's recount also disagree with Mark 's Luke have only one criminal revile Jesus not both it be easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account be make up but those who wish to believe it be all part of the error free word of G'd do not have this avenue open this be yet another example of a writer try to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology in this case the embroidery create some embarrassing problem as we have see the end of the World-- Mt. 24 now come perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passage in the New Testament it be find in all three of the synoptic gospel story and cast some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity Jesus mention the destruction of the jewish temple and building and his disciple ask he about this and about the end of the world which he have be warn about the disciple tell we when will this   the temple 's destruction   be and what will be the sign of your come and of the close of the age Jesus take care that no one lead you astray for many will come in my name say I be the christ you will hear of war and rumour of war for this must take place but the end be not yet for nation will rise against nation all this be but the beginning of the birthpang they will deliver you up put you to death and false prophet will arise and lead many astray but he who endure to the end will be save this gospel will be preach throughout the whole world a testimony to the nation and then the end will come so when you see the desolation speak of by the prophet Daniel let those who be in Judea flee to the mountain immediately after the tribulation of those day the sun will be darken the star will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven and all the tribe of the earth will mourn and see the Son of Man come and he will send out his angel and gather his elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its branch become tender and put forth leave you know that summer be near so also when you see all these thing you will know that he be near at the very gate truly I say to you this generation will not pass away until all these thing take place but of the day and hour no one knows- not the angel not the Son but only the Father therefore you also must be ready for the Son of Man be come at an hour you do not expect from this it be clear that Jesus think the world would in within the lifetime of at least some of his disciple he tell they that although he does n't know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready theologian have wet their pant in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error but unfortunately Jesus make himself to explicit he tell his disciple that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be sweep away there have be some who resort to remove the inerrant nature of the Bible and say that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really mean this race of people will not pass away of course the word for generation be use many time to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciple it be an interesting notion that when God decide to learn Greek he did n't learn it well enough to make himself clear but it be quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciple at least some of they be suppose to live to the end of the World the charge of mistranslation be completely blow away by look at the Apostles response it become abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7 1 Peter 4.7 1 John 2.18 and Rev. 22.20 that Jesus mean exactly what he say the end be very near for 2,000 year Christians have rationalise this 24th chapter of Matthew or ignore its meaning altogether for 2,000 year they have wait for their execute leader to come back hear of war and rumour of war sure that he be come soon surely he must be all we must do be wait can you imagine how tired he must be sit around up there be holy wait for just the right moment to spring so shortly after his crucifixion Jesus of Nazareth Joshua ben Joseph die it be say that after three day or three day and three night or three period of time or three eternal second --or three of whatever they can decide make for less trouble-- he be see again resurrect glow with divine radiance then the Saviour decide it was n't in the good interest of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappear from sight into heaven so the story go anyway as have be see there be many thing attribute to Jesus when people get around to write the gospel story down to they Jesus be the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have see though that this matter be quite shaky but throughout Church history Christians have hold fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal objection could not be solve with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness keep away from question to question and investigate have never be the easy way to treat matter thus for 2,000 year the prophecy cite in

1442;yes this be certainly one of the traditional idea about the mithraic cult although not the only one it have many element that seem to have be borrow by Catholicism e.g. the Mass communion the sharing of a sacred meal consecration of bread and wine etc for quite an amusing novel that use this same idea check out the Covenant of the Flame by David Morrell it have some quite interesting occult bit and lot of kill I wo n't spoil it by reveal the ending but I will say that it be relevant to mithraism;3

1444;look at   1   we find that during roman time Tyre vie with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period- that Tyre be the seat of a Christian bishop eventually with 14 diocese under it- that the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia be the basilica build in Tyre ca 314- that Tyre be well know for its export of glassware wine white marble and dye cloth- that Tyre along with other seaport provide outlet for South Arabian indian and even chinese trade- that Tyre have to accomodate its grow population by follow a perpendicular rather than horizontal line of growth because it be run out of land to build on)- that Tyre establish colony of its own none of this sound like a small fishing village by any stretch of the imagination century later under the Abbasids Tyre have opulent and flourish bazaar and building of 5 6 story during this period Tyre be note for its export of sugar bead and as of old glassware during the Crusades Tyre be the second most flourishing city hold by Franks there be a lot more but I get tired of writing in   2   we read the follow description of modern Lebanon other   major city   in Lebanon include Tripoli Sidon Tyre Baalbek and Zahlah   my emphasis   this source also discuss the impact of the lebanese Civil War and the israeli military action 1978 1982 on the trading port of Tyre and Sidon it note that after Israel 's withdrawel in 1984 Tyre appear to enjoy a revival of its local economy if Tyre be such an insignificant little fishing village at present why be it always call a city or above a major city why do it show up on all the map when population figure for city in Lebanon be give why be Tyre always one of the city on the list even if the list be only a dozen city long   1   Philip K.

Schriever 's icbm I find it hard to swell with pride that the good new space lifter idea be to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missile well the pessimist be wrong the legacy be continue this event be proof to our technological parent We 've listen to your story we 've catch your enthusiasm and can do spirit and we 've learn from your achievement and your mistake let I honor one of you who be part of that history and the impetus behind this history Max Hunter you be one of the great engineer of the firt great age of space exploration your insight and discipline build the Thor icbm later incorporate into today 's most successful launch vehicle the Delta you tell we in the 60 's that a new form of launch vehicle a single stage reusable rocket can and should be build you advocate this idea tirelessly it be elegantly simple as be all great breakthrough you show we how to build it you convince we it could be do you be work by our side to weld its component into place most important you remind we of a prime engineering principle undoubtably one you learn from the generation before you the generation that build transcontinental aviation in the 1920 's and 30 's build a little and test a little and Max you pass all of this on to people like Pat Ladner who start this program for the SDI Douglas Aircraft did n't start with a dc-10 they did n't even start with a dc-3 our grandfather build a little test a little even sell a little and make a little money before they move on to the next step they did n't take a decade or more before put the first rubber on the road Max Hunter you did n't take ten year to build Thor and by God we 're not go to take ten year to show that low cost single stage reusable aerospace transportation be real we end the cold war in a few short year it take the same team here today but a few year to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end we you and we launch a series of satellite the Delta experiment in about a year apiece this more than anything else signal our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union those who make the decision on both side have underscore the importance of our work in bring about a new international relationship but it be the same team which be now put in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that be our legacy for the next generation we will make space access routine and affordable we build this magnificent flying machine in two year this summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time then we can and surely will build in the next three year a reusable sub orbital rocket it will allow we to use space rapidly affordably and efficiently as no other nation can and yes we 'll make a little money off it too then and only then we 'll spend another three year to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system the dc-3 of space will be a reality we may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthrough of our former cold war adversary what a wonderful irony if this SDI product and russian effort to counter SDI merge to power mankind 's next step to the star to be sure we must guard against the temptation to leap to the final answer Robert Goddard 's first rocket were n't Saturn V 's if we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollar and a few more year to jump immediately to a full orbital system we will fail Max Hunter and his colleague show the way three year and a cloud of dust in our case rocket exhaust there be no short cut if we expect to reshape the world again we must do it one brick at a time mind on task at hand;2

1488;Let 's say you have a scan image of a line drawing- in this case a boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have a set of reference point whose true x y position be know now you digitize the drawing manually in this case use Yaron Danon 's excellent Digitize program that is you use a program which convert cursor position to x y and save those value when you click the mouse upon digitize you notice that the reference point value that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant way from the know true value this be understandable because the scanned drawing be a reproduction of the original and there be successive source of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper error introduce in the printing process scanner error and what have you the error be not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustment such as stretching   contract uniformly over x or y or rotate the whole drawing be not satisfactory so the question be do any kind soul know of an algorithm for remove such distortion in particular if I have three set of point reference(x y the know true value DistortedReference(x y the same point with know error DistortedData(x y other point with unknown error what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the error I suspect the problem could be solve by treat the distorted reference point as result from the projection of a bumpy 3d surface solve for the surface and then flatten it to remove the error in the other data point any kind and informed soul out there have any idea or well yet pointer to treatment of the same or similar problem thank;1

1496;this fray thread have turn into a patented alt.atheism 5 on-1 ping pong game and I do n't have any strong disagreement so I 'll try to stick to the one thing I do n't quite follow about the argument it seem to I that there be a contradiction in argue that the Bible be enlighten for its time i.e. close to what we would consider morally good base on our standard and past experience on the one hand   I hope this summarize this argument adequately   and on the other hand      Disclaimer I 'm speak from the jewish perspective      where the Bible mean what many call the Old Testament      and where the interpretation be not necessarily the      raw text but instead the court case commentary      and tradition pass down through jewish community        this seem the crux to I if you judge the Bible accord to a long     line of tradition and interpretation come down to the current day     rather than on its own merit as a cultural artifact then of course     it will correspond more closely with more contemporary value    but if that be how the Bible be actually be use today   should n't that be how we should judge it if most people   use scissor to cut paper should n't Consumer 's Reports   test scissor for paper cut ability even though   scissor may have be design originally to cut cloth That be possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teach jewish morality today but it hardly seem fair to claim that this highly interpret version be what be enlighten for its time to attempt to extend the analogy this be like say that the original scissor maker be unusually advanced at paper cutting for their time even though they only ever cut cloth and have never even hear of paper I 'm not argue that the Bible be disgusting though some of the history depict in it be by modern standard however history be full of similar abuse and I do n't think the biblical account be bad than their contemporary or possibly ours on the other hand I do n't know of any reason to think the history describe in the Bible show   less   abuse than their contemporary or our that complex and benign moral tradition have evolve base on particular mythic interpretation of that history be interesting but I still do n't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history;0

1500;   for several year I 've periodically ask Charley Wingate to explain this    mythical alternative to rationality which he propound so enthusiastically    when he pop up every few month his reluctance to explain indicate to I    that it be not so hot    I 've say enough time that there be no alternative that should think you   might have catch on by now and there be no alternative but the point   be rationality is n't an alternative either the problem of metaphysical   and religious knowledge be unsolvable-- or I should say human can not   solve they if there be truly no alternative then you have no basis whatsoever for your claim the usual line here which you call a prejudgment of atheism and dispute be that reason be all we have here you admit that you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim that there be anything other than reason or that reason be inapplicable in religious knowledge except possibly that reason conflict with religious knowledge this sound very much like I ca n't provide a rational defense for my belief but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it may be false I hope it make you happy but your repeat and unfounded assertion to this effect do n't advance your cause;0

Laboratory 's Image Processing System Michael Landy co write and sell a general purpose package for image processing which have be use for basically all the usual image processing application robotic medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it be call hip and deal with sequence of multiband image in the same way it deal with single image it have be grow since we first write it both by addition from we as well as a huge user contribute library feature description hips be a set of image processing module which together provide a powerful suite of tool for those interested in research system development and teaching it handle sequence of image movie in precisely the same manner as single frame program and subroutine have be develop for simple image transformation filtering convolution Fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line draw manipulation digital image compression and transmission method noise generation and image statistic computation over 150 such image transformation program have be develop as a result almost any image processing task can be perform quickly and conveniently additionally HIPS allow user to easily integrate their own custom routine new user become effective use HIPS on their first day HIPS feature image that be self documenting each image store in the system contain a history of the transformation that have be apply to that image HIPS include a small set of subroutine which primarily deal with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tool in the form of UNIX    filters it come complete with source code on line manual page and on line documentation Host Configuration Requirements originally develop at New York University hips now represent one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environment currently available it run under the UNIX operating system it be modular and flexible provide automatic documentation of its action and be almost entirely independent of special equipment HIPS be now in use on a variety of computer include Vax and Microvax Sun Apollo Masscomp NCR Tower Iris IBM AT etc for image display and input driver be supply for the Grinnell and Adage Ikonas image processor and the Sun-2 Sun-3 sun- 4 and sun-386i console we also supply user contribute driver for a number of other framestore and windowing package Sun gfx Sun console Matrox VIP-1024 ITI IP-512 Lexidata Macintosh II x windowing system and Iris the Hipsaddon package include an interface for the CRS-4000 it be a simple matter to interface hips with other frame- store and we can put interested user in touch with user who have interface HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube max- Video hip can be easily adapt for other image display device because 98 of HIPS be machine independent availability HIPS have prove itself a highly flexible system both as an interactive research tool and for more production- orient task it be both easy to use and quickly adapt and extend to new use hip be supply on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format either reel- to reel or Sun cartridge and come with source code library a library of convolu- tion mask and on

1557;well I 've say that when an innocent person have be execute this be objectively a murder however who be at blame be another question it seem that the entire society that sanction any sort of executions-- realize the risk be to blame yes but there be also a probablity that you will kill someone do any raondom activity presumably you have not isolate yourself totally from the rest of society because of this and I argue that our law system be a similar risk perhaps an innocent person will be punish someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminal go free as a result of our try to prevent punishment of innocent but such accident be to be totally expect give the numner of vehical on the road again the blame be on society yes but the state be not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false witness okay so this be what you call murder but the question be whether or not all such murder be wrong be you say that all taking of human life be wrong no matter what the circumstance but this be basically how it work Society accept the risk that an innocent person will be murder by execution and every member of society share this blame and most people 's definition of murder include some sort of malicious intent which be not involve in an execution be it murder violate the golden rule execution do not because by allow it at all society implicitly accept the consequence no matter who the innocent victim be read the mind of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction be moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth matter and the jury system be one method to approximate such a truth that be twelve member must be convince of a truth but then if we read the mind of these people we would know that the conviction be unfair yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we know all possible information we ca n't always determine the difference in our flawed system I think that our system be almost as good as possible but it still is n't objectively perfect you see it does n't matter if we   know   it be fair or not objectively it be either fair or it be not but what we know have no effect on an objective system why be you so sure why be   your   reality important but we can assume that the system be fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system say nothing about a totally ideal and objective system well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that be as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible yes we all bear the responsibility Most people seem willing to do this we must realize the consequence of all our action why do you keep separate the justice system from the pack I do n't think our country have an objective system but I think such an objective system can exist in theory without omniscience an objective system be not possible in practice;0

1566;in my mind to say that science have its basis in value be a bit of a reach science have its basis in observable fact i 'd say that what one choose to observe and how the observation be interpret and what significance it 's give depend a great deal on the value of the observer science be a human activity and as such be subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity the myth that scientist be above moral influence or ethical concern that their knowledge can be abstacte whole and pure from nature untainted by the bias of the scientist be nonsense Bill if one be to argue for objective value in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrate that morality itself be objective consider the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen so back to the original question and objective morality be this may be an unfortunate choice of word almost self contradictory objective in the sense use here mean something immutable and absolute while morality describe the behavior of some group of people the first term be all inclusive the second be specific the concept supposedly describe may have meaning however if there be a God as describe by the Christians for instance then he have existence apart from and independent of humankind- his existence be outside of our frame of reference reality if this being declare a thing to be so it be -necessarily- so since he have define himself as omnipotent and if his claim be to be believe he be at least omnipotent relative to we God be intrinsically self define and all reality be whatever he say it be in an objective sense if God determine a standard of conduct that standard be objective if human being be hold accountable for their conformance to that standard while permit to ignore it they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct give the term morality a nebulous meaningless sense that can be argue about by those pretend to misunderstand the standard be objective and the conduct require to meet that standard be therefore objectively determine just because it be convenient to pretend that the term morality be infinitely malleable does n't mean that the objective standard itself does n't exist morality have come to mean little more than a cultural norm or the preferred conduct of decent people make it seem subjective but it be derive from an absolute objective standard ironically this objective standard be in perfect accord with our true nature accord to Christianity at least yet be condemn as be contrary to human nre oppressive and severe this may be due as;3

alt.atheism point cover here be one which be not cover in the introduction to Atheism- you be advise to read that article as well before post these answer be not intend to be exhaustive or definitive the purpose of the periodic FAQ posting be not to stifle debate but to raise its level if you have something to say concern one of these question and which is n't cover by the answer give please feel free to make your point overview of content what be the purpose of this newsgroup Hitler be an atheist the Bible prove it Pascal 's Wager what be Occam 's Razor why it 's good to believe in Jesus why I know that God exist Einstein and God do not play dice everyone worship something why there must be a causeless cause the universe be so complex it must have be design independent evidence that the Bible be true Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem George Bush on atheism and patriotism I know where hell be biblical contradiction want the USA be a christian nation the USA be not a christian nation subject what be the purpose of this newsgroup typical posting why have a newsgroup about atheism why do atheist organize in group what be there to discuss response many thing be discuss here include   whether it be reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upset one 's family   Prayer in school   discrimination against atheist   Sunday trading law   the satanic child abuse myth   whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet   how religious society prey sic on new college student   how to get rid of unwanted proselytizer   whether religion be a danger to society andor the individual   why people become atheist of course inevitably alt.atheism tend to attract evangelical Christians look for someone to convert Most reader of the newsgroup do n't want to be preach to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tear apart particularly ill consider or uninformed posting subject Hitler be an atheist typical posting Hitler be an atheist and look at what he do response Adolf Hitler be emphatically not an atheist as he say himself the folkish minded man in particular have the sacred duty each in his own denomination of make   peoplestopjusttalke   superficiallyofGod'swill andactuallyfulfillGod'swill and   notletgod'swordbedesecrated.orig ital   for god 's will give man their form their essence and their ability anyone who destroy his work be declare war on the lord 's creation the divine will therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed step outside the confine of his religious community and try to butt into the other     hence today I believe that I be act in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator   bydefendingmyselfagainstthejew iam   fightingfortheworkoftheLord.orig ital   Adolf Hitler from Mein Kampf trans Ralph Mannheim of course someone bad believe something do not make that belief wrong It 's also entirely possible that Hitler be lie when he claim to believe in God we certainly ca n't conclude that he 's an atheist though subject the Bible prove it typical posting in the Bible it say that response Most of the reader of alt.atheism feel that the Bible be of questionable accuracy as it be write thousand of year ago by many author who be record oral tradition that exist many year before thus any claim truth in it be of questionable legitimacy this is n't to say that the Bible have no truth in it- simply that any truth must be examine before be accept many of the reader of this group also feel that because any passage be subject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only be not legitimate note that this feeling tend to extend to other book it be also remarkable to many atheist that theist tend to ignore other equally plausible religious book in favour of those of their own religion subject Pascal 's Wager typical posting if you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lose nothing but if you do n't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it be foolish to be an atheist response this argument be know as Pascal 's Wager it have several flaw firstly it do not indicate which religion to follow indeed there be many mutually exclusive and contradictory religion out there this be often describe as the avoid the wrong hell problem if a person be a follower of religion x he may end up in religion Y 's version of hell secondly the statement that if you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect you have lose nothing be not true suppose you 're believe in the wrong God the true God might punish you for your foolishness consider also the death that have result from people reject medicine in favour of prayer another flaw in the argument be that it be base on the assumption that the two possibility be equally likely or at least that they be of comparable likelihood if in fact the possibility of there be a God be close to zero the argument become much less persuasive so sadly the argument be only likely to convince those who believe already also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief be base on evidence with some amount of intuition it be not a matter of will or cost benefit analysis formally speak the argument consist of four statement 1 one do not know whether God exist 2 not believe in God be bad for one 's eternal soul if God do exist 3 believe in God be of no consequence if God do not exist 4 therefore it be in one 's interest to believe in God there be two approach to the argument the first be to view 1 as an assumption and 2 as a consequence of it one problem with this approach in the abstract be that it create information from no information this be consider invalid in information theory statement 1 indicate one have no information about God but statement 2 indicate that beneficial information can be gain from the absolute lack of information about God this violate information entropy information have be extract from no information at no cost the alternative approach be to claim that 1 and 2 be both assumption the problem with this be that 2 be then basically an assumption which state the christian position and only a Christian will agree with that assumption the argument thus collapse to if you be a Christian it be in your interest to believe in God a rather vacuous tautology and not the way Pascal intend the argument to be view the big reason why Pascal 's wager be a failure be that if God be omniscient he will certainly know who really believe and who believe as a wager he will spurn the latter assume he actually care at all whether people believe in he subject what be Occam 's Razor typical posting People keep talk about Occam 's Razor what be it response William of Occam formulate a principle which have become know as Occam 's Razor in its original form it say do not multiply entity unnecessarily that be if you can explain something without suppose the existence of some entity then do so nowadays when people refer to Occam 's Razor they generally express it more generally for example as take the simple solution the relevance to atheism be that we can look at two possible explanation for what we see around we 1 there be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which come into being as a result of natural process 2 there be an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there be also a God who create the universe clearly this God must be of non zero complexity give that both explanation fit the fact Occam 's Razor might suggest that we should take the simple of the two solution number one unfortunately some argue that there be a third even more simple solution 3 there is n't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there we just imagine that there be this third option lead we logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable subject why it 's good to believe in Jesus typical posting I want to tell people about the virtue and benefit of my religion response preaching be not appreciate feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write posting that be on a conversion theme such posting do not belong on alt.atheism and will be reject from alt.atheism.moderate try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc you would doubtless not welcome posting from atheist to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you- please do unto other as you would have they do unto you often theist make their basic claim about God in the form of lengthy analogy or parable be aware that atheist have hear of God and know the basic claim about him- if the sole purpose of your parable be to tell atheist that God exist and bring salvation you may as well not post it since it tell we nothing we have not be tell before subject why I know that God exist typical posting I   know   from personal experience and prayer that God exist response just as many theist have personal evidence that the be they worship exist so many atheist have personal evidence that such being do not exist that evidence vary from person to person furthermore without wish to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claim all kind of unlikely thing that they have be abduct by ufo visit by the ghost of Elvis and so on subject Einstein and God do not play dice typical posting Albert Einstein believe in God do you think you 're cleverer than he response Einstein do once comment that God do not play dice   with the universe   this quotation be commonly mention to show that Einstein believe in the Christian God use this way it be out of context- it refer to Einstein 's refusal to accept the uncertainty indicate by quantum theory furthermore Einstein 's religious background be jewish rather than Christian a well quotation show what Einstein think about God be the follow I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveal himself in the orderly harmony of what exist not in a God who concern himself with fate and action of human being Einstein be unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality- a reality which would not be subject to random event and which would not be dependent upon the observer he believe that QM be incomplete and that a well theory would have no need for statistical interpretation so far no such well theory have be find and much evidence suggest that it never will be a long quote from Einstein appear in Science Philosophy and Religion a symposium publish by the Conference on Science Philosophy and Religion in their Relation to the democratic Way of Life Inc. New York 1941 in the more a man be imbue with the order regularity of all event the firm become his conviction that there be no room leave by the side of this order regularity for cause of a different nature for he neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exist as an independent cause of natural event to be sure the doctrine of a personal God interfere with natural event could never be   refute    italic his   in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domain in which scientific knowledge have not yet be able to set foot but I be convinced that such behavior on the part of representative of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal for a doctrine which be to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress in their struggle for the ethical good teacher of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past place such vast power in the hand of priest in their labor they will have to avail themselves of those force which be capable of cultivate the Good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself this be to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task it be of course a lie what you read about my religous conviction a lie which be be systematically repeat I do not believe in a personal God and I have never deny this but have express it clearly if something be in I which can be call religious then it be the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it the latter quote be from Albert Einstein the Human Side edit by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman and publish by Princeton University Press also from the same book I do not believe in immortality of the individual and I consider ethic to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it of course the fact that Einstein choose not to believe in Christianity do not in itself imply that Christianity be false subject everyone worship something typical posting everyone worship something whether it 's money power or God response if that be true everyone be a polytheist theist care just as much about those thing that atheist care about if the atheists reaction to for example their family amount to worship then so do the theists subject why there must be a causeless cause typical posting set of integer that have a low bind each have a small member so chain of cause must all have a first element a causeless cause response the set of real number great than zero have a definite lower bound but have no small member far even if it be true that there must be a causeless cause that do not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favour by any particular religion subject the universe be so complex it must have be design typical posting the presence of design in the universe prove there be a God surely you do n't think all this appear here just by chance response this be know as the Argument from Design it be a matter of dispute whether there be any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of live creature on the earth be evidence of a creator be well advise to read the newsgroup talk.origin for a while there be insufficient space to summarize both side of that debate here however the conclusion be that there be no scientific evidence in favour of so call Scientific Creationism furthermore there be much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexity of the universe and life on earth the origin of the Argument by Design be a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human be so improbable that surely it ca n't have come about by chance- that surely there must be some external intelligence direct thing so that human come from the chaos deliberately but if human intelligence be so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashion an entire universe complete with conscious being must be immeasurably more unlikely the approach use to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turn around and apply to the creationist position this lead we to the familiar theme of if a creator create the universe what create the creator but with the addition of spiral improbability the only way out be to declare that the creator be not create and just be or be from here we might as well ask what be wrong with say that the universe just be without introduce a creator indeed Stephen Hawking in his book a Brief history of Time explain his theory that the universe be closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end the Argument from Design be often state by analogy in the so call Watchmaker Argument one be ask to imagine that one have find a watch on the beach do one assume that it be create by a watchmaker or that it evolve naturally of course one assume a watchmaker yet like the watch the universe be intricate and complex- so the argument go the universe too must have a creator the Watchmaker analogy suffer from three particular flaw over and above those common to all Arguments by Design firstly a watchmaker create watch from pre existing material whereas God be claim to have create the universe from nothing these two sort of creation be clearly fundamentally different and the analogy be therefore rather weak secondly a watchmaker make watch but there be many other thing in the world if we walk far along the beach and find a nuclear reactor we would n't assume it be create by the watchmaker the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creator each responsible for a different part of creation finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch be not part of nature because it be order and therefore stand out from the randomness of nature yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe be obviously not random but show element of order the Watchmaker argument be thus internally inconsistent subject independent evidence that the Bible be true typical posting the event of the New Testament be confirm by independent documentary evidence for example response the writing of Josephus be often mention as independent documentary evidence early version of Josephus 's work be think not to have mention Jesus or James- the extant version discuss John in a non christian context many scholar believe that the original mention Jesus and James in pass but that this be expand by christian copyist several reconstruction of the original text have be publish to this effect much information appear in the Ecclesiastical history of Eusebius about 320 C.E. it be worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who be generally acknowledge as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity it be Eusebius who be generally give the title of authorship for this material aside from the New Testament the biographical information about Jesus be more well document for further information please consult the Frequently ask Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian subject Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem typical posting Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrate that it be impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete response Godel 's First Incompleteness Theorem say that in any consistent formal system which be sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expression which can never be prove to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system technically speak the system must also be recursive- that is there must be a decision procedure for determine whether a give string be an axiom within the formal system essentially all such system can formulate what be know as a Liar Paradox the classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English be this sentence be false note that if a proposition be undecidable the formal system can not even deduce that it be undecidable the logic use in theological discussion be rarely well define so claim that Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrate that it be impossible to prove or disprove the existence of God be worthless in isolation one can trivially define a formal system in which it be possible to prove the existence of God simply by have the existence of God state as an axiom this be unlikely to be view by atheist as a convincing proof however it may be possible to succeed in produce a formal system build on axiom that both atheist and theist agree with it may then be possible to show that Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem hold for that system however that would still not demonstrate that it be impossible to prove that God exist within the system furthermore it certainly would n't tell we anything about whether it be possible to prove the existence of God generally note also that all of these hypothetical formal system tell we nothing about the actual existence of God- the formal system be just abstraction another frequent claim be that Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrate that a religious text the Bible the Book of Mormon or whatever can not be both consistent and universally applicable religious text be not formal system so such claim be nonsense subject George Bush on atheism and patriotism typical posting do George Bush really say that atheist should not be consider citizen response the following exchange take place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush on August 27 1988 Sherman be a fully accredited reporter and be present by invitation as a member of the press corps the republican presidential nominee be there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois the discussion turn to the presidential primary RS what will you do to win the vote of Americans who be atheist GB I guess i 'm pretty weak in the atheist community faith in God be important to I RS surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who be atheist GB no I do n't know that atheist should be consider as citizen nor should they be consider patriot this be one nation under God RS do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church GB yes I support the separation of church and state I 'm just not very high on atheist UPI report on May 8 1989 that various atheist organization be still angry over the remark the exchange appear in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27 1989 it can also be find in Free Enquiry magazine Fall 1988 issue volume 8 number 4 page 16 on October 29 1988 Mr. Sherman have a confrontation with Ed Murnane cochairman of the Bush Quayle 88 Illinois campaign this concern a lawsuit Mr. Sherman have file to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 Chicago Illinois from force his first grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as one nation under God Bush 's phrase the follow conversation take place RS American Atheists file the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday do the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing EM It 's bullshit RS what be bullshit em everything that American Atheists do Rob be bullshit RS thank you for tell I what the official position of the Bush campaign be on this issue EM you 're welcome after Bush 's election American Atheists write to Bush ask he to retract his statement on February 21st 1989 C.

1570;SSF be up for redesign again Let 's do it right this time Let 's step back and consider the functionality we want   1   microgravity   vacuum process research   2   life science research adaptation to space   3   spacecraft maintenence the old NASA approach explifie by Shuttle and SSF so far be to centralize functionality these project fail to meet their target by a wide margin the military and commercial user take most of their payload off Shuttle after waste much effort to tie their payload to it and SSF have crumble into disorganization and miscommunication over   50 billion have be spend on these two project with no reduction in launch cost and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization meanwhile military and commercial user have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation firstly different function be break down into different constellation place in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the GPS   Navstar constellation in 12 hour orbit comsat in Clarke and Molniya orbit etc secondly the task be distribute amongst several spacecraft in a constellation provide for redundancy and full coverage where need ssf 's 3 main function require quite different environment and be also prime candidate for constellization   1   we have the making of a microgravity constellation now COMET and Mir for long duration flight Shuttle   Spacelab for short duration flight the good strategy for this area be inexpensive incremental improvement installation of U.S. facility on Mir Shuttle   Mir linkup and transition from Shuttle   Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO   Spacehab   COMET or SSTO   SIF   COMET we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environment eg the high radiation Van Allen belt or gas   plasma gradient in comet tail the COMET system can be much more easily retrofit for these task where a station be too large to affordably launch beyond LEO   2   we need to study life science not just in microgravity but also in lunar and martian gravity and in the radiation environment of deep space instead of the protect shelter of LEO this be a very long term low priority project since astronaut will have little practical use in the space program until cost come down order of magnitude furthermore use astronaut severely restrict the scope of the investigation and the sample size so I propose LabRatSat a constellation tether bolo satellite that test out various level of gravity in super van Allen Belt orbit that be representative of the radiation environment encounter on Earth Moon Earth Mars earth asteroid etc trip the miniaturized life support machinery might be operate real time from earth thru a VR interface after several orbital mission have be fly follow ons can act as ldef on the lunar and martian surface test out the actual environment at low cost before   billion be spend on astronaut   3   by far the large market for spacecraft servicing be in Clarke orbit I propose a fleet of small teleoperate robot and small test satellite on which ground engineer can practice their skill once in place robot can pry stick solar array and antenna attach solar battery power pack inject fuel etc once the fleet be work it can be spin off to commercial company(s who can work with the comsat company to develop comsat replaceable module standard by apply the successful constellation strategy and getting rid of the fail centralized strategy of STS and old SSF we have radically improve the capability of the program while greatly cut its cost for a fraction of SSF 's pricetag we can fix satellite where the satellite be we can study life 's adaptation to a much large   more representative variety of space environment and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and if need in special purpose orbit N.B. we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well greatly cut its cost and increase its functionality Mars Network and Artemis be two good example of this- more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plant on Mars that can be use to fuel planet wide rover   ballistic hopper prospect and sample return the descendant of LabRatSat 's technology can be use as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed ecology greenhouse on Mars at low cost;2
1571;Exodus 21:22 25 22 and if man struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she have a miscarriage yet there be no far injury he shall surely be fine as the woman 's husband may demand of him- and he shall pay as the judge decide 23 but if there be any further injury then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life 24 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot 25 burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise the most straightforward interpretation of these verse be that if man in a fight strike a woman and cause she to miscarry the penalty be only a fine if however the woman be injure or die the   lex talionis   doctrine of an eye for an eye apply this be the jewish interpretation and be support by jewish commentary on these verse this be quite an embarrassment for pro lifer Christians so there be of course an alternate explanation the alternative interpret the word miscarriage to mean premature birth i.e. the child be bear alive and further injury to mean injury to either the woman or the fetus this be not a straightforward interpretation it be not so far as I know support by any jewish commentary and it do not appear to be support by any other part of the Bible what if any historical reference do we have to abortion at this time do the ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion I be truly ask not make a point veil as a question if there be little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion it be not surprising the Bible make little reference to it as it make little reference to nuclear power and contamination;0

1645;I post this several day ago for Dave Butler he may have miss it my Usenet board have change a little just in case he miss it here it be again Dave Butler write from davebpogo.wv.tek.com Dave Butler subject re new biblical contradiction   fallaciously   ANSWERED Judas date Thu Apr 1 20:52:11 1993 I can basically restrict this post to show the type of evidence Mr DeCenso have present and answer his two question and a couple of his spurious insult and false claim MY REPLY O.K. DB   by the way Mr DeCenso you really should have look in the index of your Bauer Arndt Gingrich greek lexicon you would have find that the word in act for lot be klero not CHORION as state by Mr Archer and nowhere in the very large discussion of klero in do the to Theological Dictionary of the New Testament by Bromley be the meaning burial plot discuss it discuss the form of klero eg klero kleroo etc and the various meaning of klero eg plot of land and inheritance but mention nothing about CHORION or burial plot why do this not surprise I thus it would seem to be a very good thing you dump Archer as a reference   DB later correct himself                                                                       from davebpogo.wv.tek.com Dave Butler subject re new biblical contradiction   fallaciously   ANSWERED Judas date Fri Apr 2 02:32:11 1993 I owe the group an apology it be my habit to check my article before and after their submission for error in my last article I state I be wrong I admit that I do not have a handle on greek grammar and thus confused klero the second to last word in act 1:17 as be the plot of land discuss in actuality it be chorion which be the last word act 1:18 unfortunately my greek dictionary do not discuss chorion so I can not report as to the nuance of the word I do n't know if someone else would have catch this though I be sure that someone would be able to do so but I have an aversion to disseminate mistake especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point                                                                       MY REPLY Vary noble of you Dave I did n't want to have to go to x number of source to show you wrong although I be research CHORION a little DB of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso have give be Bullinger and Bullinger use such ridiculous exegisis that when I accuse Mr DeCenso of actually believe Bullinger he reply that I misquote he of   my response to see what I REALLY say in my posting of this article   actually Mr DeCenso you say that there be benefit to our argument in that it cause to to rediscover Bullinger 's exegisis I do not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you be convince by it   MY REPLY thank you for correct your restating of my point DB and Mr DeCenso also reply thus I apologize for think that even Mr DeCenso could find such drek convincing he should specify which part of Bullinger he find convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of this be what Bullinger believe not necessarily what I believe so which be it Mr DeCenso do you find the exegisis convincing or not MY REPLY one of my purpose in debate these allege contradiction with you and other be to diseminate many different view of possible reconciliation raise by various Bible scholar and student alike when I present MY view I will clearly distinguish they from now on DB of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso have present no greek exegisis at all and Mr DeCenso have make a big thing about my not refer back to the actual Greek thus we find this demand on his part for quality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement MY REPLY good point but in your declaring that these passage be contradictory you have produce only superficial reasoning and observation nor have you dig deeply I 'm glad you have begin in this post I will begin Greek study on these passage in more depth than I think necessary as well DB it would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso have actually use as evidence now we know what he claim for a standard as he have state it often enough but be these actual standard he have use or simply empty hyperbole Let 's see he have use a and since he be try to reconcile it to other passage we see that he have also use b on the other hand he have present no use of d historical context or e historical content or f other pertinent historical info or g cultural context or h cultural content or i other pertinent cultural info or j grammatical construction or even k hebrew and greek word study   remember Archer and Bullinger do n't count   thus we find his vaunted criterion for exegisis be just empty mouthing MY REPLY question do you find such criterion important if so do you plan on start to use they to the good of your ability or will you continue to present shallow observation I do n't mean this in a bad way at this point in our   debate   I have not find it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passage since we seem to keep beat around the bush and not get into the core of the verse I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criterion to refute your argument re Judas in Acts and Matthew but I will do my good from this point on to use several of the above criterion since you desire I to I hope you will also it will greatly enhance our study of these passage DB the only thing he have actually use beyond the passage itself be any other passage thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list be red herring and his only real criterion seem to be MY REPLY the reason be simple you be mistate the passage you claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another- I do not see the passage contradict one another 1 they may very well be complimentary as many scholarly source mention- 2 Matthew may not be present Judas death as you claim but we 'll look at your defense of this later also the reward of iniquity in the act PASSAGE may not be the 30 piece of silver in Matthew 's PASSAGES although you have a valiant attempt later at state why you believe it be at this beginning stage in our debate we be lay some Scriptural groundwork which will be expand upon through deep exegesis DB of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he have do with Judas death be to make it agree with another passage so that both could be consider correct MY REPLY one of the reason I have give a different exegetical view of the passage be that you seem to think the majority of scholarship be wrong in conclude these passage be complimentary however I see no problem in Tony Rose 's explanation of Judas death                                                                       how would you explain the inaccuracy between JUDAS hang himself in MATTHEW 27:5 and fall HEADLONG he BURST open                                                               this question of the manner in which Judas die be one with which we be constantly confront in our travel many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two account as an obvious irreconcilable error some have go so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible be destroy by these contradictory account however this be not the case at all Matthew relate that Judas hang himself while Peter tell we he fall and be crush by the impact the two statement be indeed different but do they necessarily contradict each other Matthew do not say that Judas do not fall- neither do Peter say that Judas do not hang himself this be not a matter of one person call something black and the other person call it white both account can be true and supplementary a possible reconstruction would be this Judas hang himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlook the valley of Hinnom after he hang there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope give way and Judas fall down the ledge mangle his body in the process the fall could have be before   or   after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility be entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom be examine from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terrace 25 to 40 foot in height and almost perpendicular there be still tree around the ledge and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that Judas strike one of the jagged rock on this way down tear his body open it be important to remember that we be not tell how long Judas remained hang from the tree or how advanced be the decomposition of his body before his fall Louis Gaussen relate a story of a man who be determined to kill himself this individual place himself on the sill of a high window and point a pistol at his head he then pull the trigger and leap from the window at the same time on the other hand a person could say that this man take his life by shoot himself while another could rightly contend he commit suicide by jump form the tall building in this case both be true as both be true in the case of Matthew 's and Peter 's account of the death of Judas it be merely a situation of different perspective of the same event                                                                       your only reason for reject this be I believe your attempt to discredit inerrancy you have n't relate how this be impossible or highly unlikely Here be what you say in an early post                                                                       DB   quote Tony Rose   the add text in this version be so heavy that assume you be truly so opposed to such tactic you should find it not credible but you seem to find Tony rose 's eisegesis satisfactory while clearly reject David Joslin 's                                                                       here you discredit Tony 's explanation base on what you deem too heavy for the passage but you have n't address why you feel that way you can say it 's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that does n't tell I it did n't happen nor have you show why you reject that possibility question be Matthew lie or be Luke lie or be they both lie or be either or both of they misinformed why do you think there be such an alleged contradiction I do not think you have ever tell we what you believe in this respect DB at present though Mr DeCenso only ask two question of I actually I find question 1 to be a rather stupid request but I will answer it because he now restrict himself to two point first I would point out that hang be a very efficient manner for end a life in fact it be a bit of a fluke when someone survive hang except in fantasy cowboy movie and even then it usually refer to as an attempt hanging MY REPLY I work at an agency that investigate child abuse and neglect today I get a call re a child that attempt suicide by hang himself because his mother be on crack he fail in his attempt and be in a child 's psych ward at a local hospital hang attempt be not always successful to assume that because most hanging be successful this one be also be beg the question if I may quote you   last night listen to   the Bible Answer Man   broadcast the Christian Research Institute 's show one of the scholar on there use several of these term that you use I be not all that familiar with they the man on the BAM show teach Comparative Religion and Logic it be interesting   DB this be so prevalent that so that to say a man hang himself with no other qualifier be synonymous with state that he kill himself MY REPLY qualifier be important at time as we 'll see in an OT passage I 'll mention below do hang always have this outcome do Matthew who be the only source we have re Judas hang himself state that Judas die as a result to say it 's synonymous mean it have the same meaning as a boy age 14 hang himself but he live this be only one of probably thousand of document case we can discover DB now I be not alone in this thought- in fact since Mr DeCenso so respect Christian scholarly include greek scholar opinion I do some research MY REPLY thank you Dave DB interestingly not one of the christian reference I read interpret the hanging as be anything but a fatal suicide   MY REPLY    above mine   so it be ok to use christian source to back your point what about Tony 's position do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility also be it possible that the source you read may be wrong or lying or deceive in other part of their book if so should we do as we have do with Archer toss they to the side and not value anything they say include their interpretation of the hanging of Judas I be sure   you   would find some error and maybe even some deception in those source you also note they interpret the hanging as meaning he die although that be very possibly true do you find that in the text itself remember that be the first criterion we must examine DB this include the Biblical Knowledge Commentary by Woodward and Zuck MY REPLY which I own It 's a good source of commentary info but not inerrant DB the Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible by Laydon the one volume Bible Commentary by J R Dunelow Word meaning of the Testament Ralph Earl the Abingdon Bible Commentary publish by Abingdon Harpers Bible Commentary by William Neal actually I could have present many more as well MY REPLY I appreciate your do this research Dave maybe we be get somewhere in how we both should approach these allege contradiction more in depth study DB in each case these reference specifically describe that the interpretation of Matt 27:5 as successful suicide and thus I can only conclude that the   greek word apagchw(ie hang oneself be translate as a successful hanging MY REPLY    above mine   no you ca n't only conclude this although as Tony say this be a highly probable outcome but Matthew do not state death as be a result the greek word be APAGCHO Matthew 27:5 be it 's only occurrence in the New Testament in the septuagint the greek translation of the OT use at the time of Jesus it 's only use in 2 Samuel 17:23 now when Ahithophel see that his advice be not follow he saddle a donkey and arise and go home to his house to his city then he put his household in order and hang himself and died- and he be bury in his father 's tomb   Notice that not only be it state that Ahithophel hang himself   Gr Sept. APAGCHO   but it explicitly add and die here we have no doubt of the result in Matthew we be not explicitly tell Judas die also there be nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure it simply mean hang oneself DB but Mr DeCenso you be more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable   christian scholar that insist that the hanging be not successful MY REPLY   above mine   reputable you mean one that have never err as far as insist that the hanging be unsuccessful that ca n't be do even by I   as I say in an early post                                                                       although I still agree with Tony 's exegesis as be the most probable explanation regard Judas death take into account several criterion I 've recently notice some new thing in Matthew MAT 27:5 8 then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself but the chief priest take the silver piece and say it be not lawful to put they into the treasury because they be the price of blood and they consult together and buy with they the potter 's field to bury stranger in therefore that field have be call the field of blood to this day first of all notice that the text do not say that Judas die as a result of hang all it say be that he go and hang himself Luke however in act tell we that and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrail gush out this be a pretty clear indication along with the other detail give in Acts Peter 's speech the need to pick a new apostle etc that at least after Judas fall he be dead so the whole concept that   Matthew and Luke both recount Judas death be highly probable but not clear   cut                                                                        I also write                                                                       MY REPLY here we have a stickler Dave that I have to say I just recently notice Let 's look at the passage in Matthew MAT 27:4 say I have sin by betray innocent blood and they say what be that to we you see to it MAT 27:5 then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself MAT 27:6 but the chief priest take the silver piece and say it be not lawful to put they into the treasury because they be the price of blood MAT 27:7 and they consult together and buy with they the potter 's field to bury stranger in MAT 27:8 therefore that field have be call the field of blood to this day Notice verse 5 then he go and hang himself Matthew do not say Judas die do it should we assume he die as a result of the hanging    what do act say ACT 1:18 now this man purchase a field with the wage of iniquity- and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrail gush out ACT 1:20 for it be write in the book of Psalms let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it'- and let another take his office here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas death so my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re the two account of Judas death be this Matthew does n't necessarily explain how Judas died- he do   say Judas hang himself but he did n't specifically say Judas die in the hang incident    however act seem to show we his graphic demise therefore there be no contradiction between Matthew and act re Judas   death MY REPLY we do know from Matthew that he do hang himself and act probably record his death although it 's possible and plausible that he fall from the hanging and hit some rock thereby burst open I can no long assume that to be the case therefore no contradiction Matthew do not say Judas die as a   result of the hanging do he Most scholar believe he probably do but                                                                         I quote all that to show that I highly regard the scholars explanation but in look at the text initially we ca n't assume Judas die it be however highly probable   DB by the way while all agree that Judas die from the hanging the book have different way of deal with the contradiction we be discuss one simply ignore it entirely and simply refer back to Matthew 's version as the correct version in both Matt and act the Biblical Knowledge Commentary suggest the hypothesis that Judas hang and then when he rot his belly explode which does n't explain his headlong fall or that his branch or rope break and he fall to his death and his gut gush out which does n't explain how a hang man would fall headlong rather than foot first MY REPLY the outcome of any fall be dependent upon many factor how high the person be suspend before the fall any obstruction such as tree branch that may have deviate the fall how steep an incline of rocky surface the victim fall upon thus possibly roll or bounce of several rock etc in a superficial examination of the act passage and the Matthew passage we be not give a lot of info on the geographical specific but Tony in the above quote post give we some                                                                       a possible reconstruction would be this Judas hang himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlook the valley of Hinnom after he hang there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope give way and Judas fall down the ledge mangle his body in the process the fall could have be before   or   after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility be entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom be examine from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terrace 25 to 40 foot in height and almost perpendicular there be still tree around the ledge and a rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that Judas strike one of the jagged rock on this way down tear his body open                                                                       DB now truthfully I do not see what be comfort about Matthew confuse the source of the potter 's field prophesy but on the other hand the author be correct Matthew do make that confusion of course a biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible be guarantee true by God will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas ie where the prophesy of the potter 's field come from MY REPLY please when we be do with this study on his death remind I to discuss this with you DB as to your second question Mr DeCenso you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchase the land be indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source I would point out that in act where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity   act 1:18   it also specifically mention what act of iniquity they be talk about ie act 1:16 concern Judas who be guide to those who arrest Jesus now I would point out that when the Bible describe an act of iniquity and then immediately discuss   the   reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it be an action of iniquity other than the one discuss MY REPLY Dave we be get somewhere are n't we ACT 1:15 and in those day Peter stand up in the midst of the disciple altogether the number of name be about a hundred and twenty and say ACT 1:16 Men and brother this scripture have to be fulfil which the Holy Spirit speak before by the mouth of David concern Judas who become a guide to those who arrest Jesus- ACT 1:17 for he be number with we and obtain a part in this ministry ACT 1:18 now this man purchase a field with the wage of iniquity- and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrail gush out ACT 1:19 and it become know to all those dwell in Jerusalem- so that field be call in their own language Akel Dama that is field of Blood ACT 1:20 for it be write in the book of Psalms let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it'- and let another take his office notice that in verse 16 the word iniquity be not use rather it state that Judas become a guide to those who arrest Jesus but the writer do not stop there vs. 17 for he be number with we and obtain a part in this ministry what part do Judas play in their ministry   JOH 12:6 this he say not that he care for the poor but because he be a thief and have the money box- and he use to take what be put in it JOH 13:29 for some thought because Judas have the money box that Jesus have say to he buy those thing we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so now we know what part Judas play he be a treasurer per se right after Peter state that Judas play a part in this ministry treasurer accord to John then Luke add the parenthetical explanation of wage of iniquity money that should have be put into the ministry but be steal by Judas to purchase a field I believe this be a well exegetical explanation of what the wage of iniquity be what do you think Dave DB now since I have give you clear answer and even reference perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you be instead of ask I what type I think you be as you do to Mr Joslin MY REPLY I will gladly admit that I be a Complete Inerrantist although I do not have that big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view Frank;3

1657;yes this be also my understanding of the majority of islamic law however I believe there be also certain legal ruling which in all five school of law 4 sunni and 1 jaffari can be level against muslim or non muslim both within and outside dar al islam I do not know if apostasy when accompany by active persistent and open hostility to Islam fall into this category of the law I do know that historically apostasy have very rarely be punish at all let alone by the death penalty my understanding be that Khomeini 's ruling be not base on the law of apostasy alone it be well know that Rushdie be an apostate long before he write the offend novel and certainly there be no precedent in the Qur'an hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantly level death penalty for apostasy I believe the charge level against Rushdie be that of fasad this ruling apply both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carry out by individual the reward be not offer by Khomeini but by individual within Iran I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what I remember be level at the author and all those who assist in the publication of the book however the charge of fasad can encompass a number of less charge I remember that when diplomatic relation break off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa Iran stress that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation be two preliminary condition for resolve the crisis but you be correct to point out that ban the book be not the main thrust behind the fatwa islamic charge such as fasad be level at people not book the Rushdie situation be follow in Iran for several month before the issuance of the fatwa Rushdie go on a media blitz present himself as a lone knight guard the sacred value of secular democracy and mock the foolish concern of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious belief as sacred fan the flame and milk the controversy to boost his image and push the book he be everywhere in the medium then muslim demonstrator in several country be kill while protest against the book Rushdie appear momentarily concern then climb back on his medium horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred right it be at this point that the fatwa on fasad be issue the fatwa be level at the person of Rushdie any action of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling the book remain in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publisher the fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompass his action as well the crime be certainly a crime in progress at many level and be be play out and play up in the the full view of the medium;0

1661;  please note the newsgroup   recent discussion about XV 's problem be hold in some newsgroup here be some text user of XV might find interesting I have add more to text to this collection article so read on even you so my article a while ago I hope author of XV correct those problem as well he can so fine program XV be that it be worth of improve I have also minor idea for 24bit XV e mail I for they any misundertanding of mine be understandable Juhana Kouhia    clip   delete   note that xv save only 8bit   rasterize images- that mean that the save jpeg be just like jpeg to gif to jpeg quality also there 's three kind of 8bit quantizers- your final image quality depend on they too this be the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago IMHO it be design error of xv'- there should not be such confusing error in program There 's two error -xv allow the saving of 8bit   rasterize image as jpeg even the original be 24bit save 8bit   rasterize image instead of original 24bit should be a special case -xv allow save the 8bit   rasterize image make with any quantizer the main case should be that xv quantize the image with the good quantizer available before save the image to a file- lousier quantizer should be just for view purpose and a special case in save the image if at all    clip    clip   delete   it be limit of   XV   but not limit of design it be error in design it be error that 8bit   quantize   rasterize image be store as jpegs- jpeg be not design to that as matter of fact I 'm sure when XV be design 24bit display be know it be not bad error to program a program for 8bit image only at that time but when 24bit image format be include to program the whole design should be change to support 24bit image that be not do and now we have -the program violate jpeg design and any 24bit image format -the program have human interface error Otherway be to drop saving image as jpeg or any 24bit format without clearly say that it be special case and not expect in normal use   delete     clip some new item follow    clip I have see that XV quantize the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have the reason surely be the quantizer use as -best24- it be surprise the same than use in ppmquant if you remember I have test some quantizer in that test I find that rlequant with default be good then come djpeg fbmquant xv our default in that order in my test ppmquant suggeede very poorly it actually give image with bad artifact I do n't know be ppmquant improve any but I expect no so use of XV 's -best24 option be not very good idea I suggest that author of XV change the quantizer to the one use in rlequant I 'm sure rle people give permission another could be one use in ImageMagick- I have not test it so I can say nothing about it    clip    clip some minor bug in human interface be key pressing and cursor click go to a buffer- often it happen that I make click error or press keyboard when cursor be in the wrong place it be very annoying when you have wait image to come about five minute and then it be go away immediately the buffer should be clean when the image be complete also good idea be to wait few second before activate keyboard and mouse for XV after the image be complete often it happen that image pop to the screen quickly just when I 'm write something with editor or such those key pressing then go to XV and image have go or something weird in the color editor when I turn a color meter and release it XV update the image it be impossible to change all RGB value first and then get the update image it be annoying wait image to be update when the setting be not ready yet I suggest of add an apply button to update the exchange do;1
1662;really    no gravity be an inherent system you do n't need any excess information other than observation to determine anything it be possible to objectively determine someone 's guilt or innocence within an non inherent system I agree that morality be not necessarily inherent unless you state that everything we do have an evolutionary basis but this do not mean that it can not be objective in theory perhaps it can be objective but not inherent anyway as I note before the practice relate to mate ritual etc among the animal be likely the only one to be consider immoral under the previous definition of the natural law therefore some revision be in order since the class of activity surround mating seem to pose some general problem it seen that you be object to the notion of an objective system because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence which would necessitate some sort of grand design I think I have it be a code of ethic which basically define undesired behavior etc an immoral behavior could be unwanted unproductive or destructive etc depend on the goal of the system that be immoral to what end;0

1687;in fact you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project the pricetag be invariably too high either in money or in hassle the important thing to realize here be that the big cost of get to the Moon be get into low Earth orbit everything else be practically down in the noise the only part of get to the Moon that pose any new problem beyond what you face in low orbit be the last 10 km the actual landing and that be not immensely difficult of course you   can   spend sagadollar saga- be the metric prefix for beelyun and beelyun on thing other than the launch but you do n't have to the major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply for more than a brief visit at least be low cost transport to Earth orbit for what it cost to launch one Shuttle or two Titan iv you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheap Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there be less ambitious way of bring cost down quite a bit any plan for do sustained lunar exploration use exist launch system be waste money in a big way give this question like whose launch facility you use be   not   a minor detail- they be very important to the cost of the launch which dominate the cost of the project;2

commercial space sale will remain flat in 1993 with current datum show only a 2 percent growth over 1992 as publish in US Industrial Outlook 1993 which be release in January revenue from the 1993 US space business be currently project to be about   4,890 m. in contrast to previous year when US commercial space sale have show double digit growth rate this year 's project result be drive by the US satellite manufacturing industry where sale be project to drop from 12 satellite worth   1,300 m in 1992 to 7 satellite worth   670 M in 1993 the US Industrial Outlook also project U.S. commercial launcher face flat demand in coming year and while predict that 1993 revenue will increase 10 percent to   450 M future sale will be adversely affect by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plan offset flat launch revenue and satellite delivery revenue for fixed and mobile satellite service be project to increase to   1,900 m primarily drive by increase revenue from broadcast and cable tv network similarly remote sense product and sale be project to increase to   250 m in 1993 up 15 US commercial SPACE REVENUES 1989 1990 1991 1992(r 1993(e commercial satellite 900 1,000 1,100

revise datum for 1992 e   estimate datum for 1993   commentary this be the first look at how the US commercial space industry be expect to do in 1993 in general not a bad report with most of the bad news concentrate in the satellite manufacturing area there change of only a few satellite worth   100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection if we look forward over several year this market sector should retain strong sale as US firm have be very successful in regain international market share in the satellite business furthermore sale of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this datum expect to be release about mid- year datum on mobile satellite ground equipment sale include such item as GPS receiver and portable satellite terminal appear to be miss from the January datum set DoC usually publish a listing of Space Business Indicators in mid year and the next revision of commercial space revenue should be release then I expect the revised revenue should easily top   5,000 M if the mobile satellite ground equipment be add back into the number and the year should show about a 10 overall market growth look beyond this year 's datum future market look quite promising the DoC project satellite service revenue could top   3,000 m by 1995 if new mobile satellite service and direct broadcasting be implement as plan and that mobile satellite station sale be expect to continue to growth at 15 20   per year through the mid 1990 's my number be somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sale over at least the next 5 10 year my pessimism be due to more conservative assumption on market capture and growth in LEO communication and satellite direct broadcasting service I do n't believe all of the current player in the yet to be bear LEO communication satellite market and in the yet to be prove direct broadcasting market will be financial success nor that sale growth will be as explosive as currently project it should also be note this year 's DoC datum be the first release to show revenue from privately fund microgravity research facility the   60 M show in the Janurary datum be primarily for the Spacehab module plan for launch in April on the Space Shuttle but also hide in these number be the project first sale from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module   2- delta win two key LAUNCH CONTRACTS McDonnell Douglas Corporation which build and market the Delta launch vehicle have win two important launch contract Motorola Inc. announce in mid February that it have select the Delta to launch most of the satellite in the 66 satellite Iridium LEO communication constellation and in mid April McDonnell Douglas be award the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract the launch service contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch be for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellite another 21 satellite have be contract to be launch by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launch these 45 satellite plan for the Delta will be launch 5 at a time provide for at least 9 launch additional satellite in the Iridium constellation such as a plan on orbit spare may also be launch on Delta although detail of the launch service contract be report to be negotiation and not yet final the USAF MLV contract also go to MDC bid a variant of their Delta II launcher this contract be only initially worth   7.5 million but establish a set of launch option for up to 36 launch encompass launch from 1996 through 2002 these launch will deploy the next generation of the USAF 's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellite plus other program first option for to meet the USAF launch option be expect to be exercise this year after which the USAF be expect to request launch of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 year under this contract the USAF can also request launch on demand service from MDC for the 1996 2002 time period with a launch to occur within 40 day of the request   Commentary if these two contract be fulfil they should provide an excellent business base for MDC 's Delta launch program through the turn of the century combine these two contract have a potential for about 45 launch worth about   2,200 m to MDC and sustain a core business base of   300 400 M   year other contract for international and commercial payload as well as for NASA Medium ELV class payload will add to this business base keep MDC as a viable commerical launch company however it should be note there be risk element in these contract Motorola 's Iridium LEO communication constellation have not yet receive a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S. nor have Motorola line up all the financing and financial partner for the Iridium venture without these approval or financial backing there will be no iridium launch but hopefully these uncertainty will be settle this year similarly the USAF MLV III program have be the target of several congressional action which have slow the production of the GPS Block IIR satellite and delete the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS   Spacelifter program at this time while it appear the MLV III contract will be execute future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contract be be reconsider as part of national space launch strategy review some opinion express from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all ELV upgrade program include the MLV program in favor of the propose Spacelifter program such opinion may have some weight in this year 's budget deliberation particularly as dod fund will be more difficult to find in the shrink US Defense budget   3- commercial REMOTE sensing VENTURE get DOC GO AHEAD the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite be approve in early February by the US Department of Commerce 's Office of Space Commerce a license be grant to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellite to provide multi spectral image of the Earth   Commentary there have be little datum release on this venture by WorldView and the doc other than the announcement of the operating and construction license this be report to be at the request of WorldView Most industry speculation identify this new venture as a Star Wars spinoff use SDI type technology to provide digital Earth sense datum and heavily integrate into digital gis database for remote sensing   gis user most probable customer for this service include exploration geologist agricultural planner and urban planner it be noteworthy this be the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act the Act as pass last November provide that remote sense datum gather from private remote sense craft may be sell to user at differ price prior to this act remote sense datum from all satellite have to be sell to all user at the same price and private remote sense venture would have have to sell at the government set Landsat data price there be rumor of several other potential commercial remote sense venture work their way through the system at different stage of development I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite system will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing datum market for the next decade or so in contrast to these large government sponsor remote sensing system small market venture such as WorldView and other can exploit market niche and use innovative technology and I believe can find profitability on the margin I predict there may be some very interesting venture appear in the next year or so   4- investment firm call GD 'S SPACE BIZ still a good investment Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley think General Dynamic 's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker despite having fail in the last 3 Atlas launch in a recent analyst 's report Morgan Stanley say we be more than ever convince that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95 plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash- generate unit base upon discussion with GD 's corporate management Morgan Stanley project that if the Atlas problem be clear up the unit could see   70 m in earning per year by 1995 and   100 m per year by 2000 this be base upon GD 's projection of capture about 10 Atlas launch per year on the world market   Commentary three failure in a row of their launch system have hurt General Dynamic 's Space Systems Division since GD have restructure to only keep a very few profitable core business many market pundit have be speculate GD 's space business might be next to be sell the Morgan Stanley report indicate GD 's Space Systems Division have some potential as a moneymaker despite current problem if they can get their act together sale be project to be about   560 m in 1993 which will probably generate a loss of about   25 M. if GD can capture their project share of the space launch market and if they have manage to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launcher then they could generate healthy profit from those sale but until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program be back on track this division will continue to show substantial loss in response to the sell off rumor in my opinion this operation be not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replace with another set from outside the firm in GD ssd 's case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problem with the Atlas Centaur as well as in sell Atlas service this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operation could find such talent in house and be able to convince customer to buy their launch service optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well candidate for this might be TRW Rockwell Lockheed and Martin and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing but most of those firm have cash flow problem mdc have have a substantial business contraction Boeing and MDC be involve with other launch firm Lockheed or have take on substantial debt Martin and come up with the   700 1500 M purchase price for the division be a big chunk of change for any company   5 ariane PREDICTS DIP in LAUNCH demand Arianespace the operator of the Ariane launch system be project a dip in launch demand in the late 1990 's in early February Arianespace release their annual market survey which detail their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade over short run Arianespace expect to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market of 54 international and commercial launch plan through 1995 Ariane hold contract for 31 General Dynamics Atlas vehicle hold 14 contract McDonnell Douglas Delta hold 7 and great Wall 's Long March vehicle hold 2 launch contract three quarter of future launch contract for which Ariane can compete be project to come from communication satellite with the remain 25 split between weather Earth observation and scientific satellite Most of the future telecommunication demand growth be predict to come from the Asia   Pacific region Arianespace expect the current market consolidation of individual satellite operator into regional or national group will continue with these group invest in heavy satellite with large communication payload carry more transponder Arianespace predict the average mass of telecommunication satellite should increase by 20   over today 's average level to about 3000 kg in GEO demand for commercial launch service be expect to remain strong over the next three year but in the second half of the decade Arianespace predict demand will decrease arianespace base this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly as new data compression technique appear to could double or triple transponder capacity use exist or near term transponder one of the significant possible change in the market be identify as the arrival of new launch vehicle include russian launch system but Arianespace predict that in the long term investor purchase launch service be look for the good trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch service will have to prove out their capability and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal   Commentary ariane release their market survey annually and I report on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN   STI compare the two survey there are n't outstanding difference in the number the most notable change be the consideration of new datum compression technique reduce the demand for new physical transponder on orbit I note that in contrast to some prediction demand for space- base communication transponder appear to be remain strong while fiber optic line be make substantial inroad into the establish point to point telecommunication market grow demand for telecommunications service world wide and for point to- multipoint broadcast service have prevent a decrease in space transponder demand fiberoptic cable provide a high capability service but only from established point a to establish point B. to establish a fiberoptic link it be necessary to install cable between the point and while there be improved network solution instal a large network of distribute fiberoptic link can cost million or billion of dollar for broadcast service where there be not an exist ground network structure satellite still offer the most cost effective solution and if new service be require into a new region it be cheap to install a small satellite link cost only a few ten of thousand of dollar and tie into the exist global satellite network this allow rapid growth of new satellite service and have keep demand high the replacement market for fiberoptic be grow as well since as demand grow between the point service it become cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic since the telecommunication and datum transfer market be still grow rapidly satellite market projection remain rosy but satellite be also get long orbital lifetime current generation satellite be now get guarantee of at 15 year of on orbit service or more in contrast to 10 year of service from last generation 's satellite this have cut back some of the launch demand as satellite owner be reschedule replacement satellite launch over long interval and as last note- arianespace did n't flag it this year but it look like the space transportation market will be rather over- supply by exist launch system in the near term the annual commercial launch demand be for about 15 20 medium sized satellite per year from the supply side Ariane be capable of launch up to about a dozen medium sized satellite a year Delta be capable of about 9 12 per year Atlas be capable of 6 12 Long March 4 8 Japan 's H vehicle 2 4 Russia 's Proton capable of 8 and other system such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10 20 medium launch per year That be a lot of capability for a small market we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launch   6- ntsb investigate PEGASUS LAUNCH over ABORTED abort the 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation have spawn an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rule a valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission be overridden and the Pegasus be launch in violation of range safety rule in the last few minute of the Pegasus launch countdown one of two abort command receiver aboard the Pegasus fail such a failure typically scrub a launch and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island VA issue a mission abort order about a minute before the schedule Pegasus launch somehow this command be overridden by the OSC launch team or the message be lose in the communication channel and the Pegasus be launch despite the valid abort call fortunately the Pegasus function as expect and the abort command receiver be not need but this incident do spark an investigation since a valid abort order be give under agree to launch constraint rule and be not obey lead the investigation be the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB with support from NASA OSC and the Air Force this investigation mark the first time NTSB have take the lead on an incident involve a space launch accord to the NTSB their investigation will take about 6 month and be primarily look at line of authority communication link and safety procedure use in the launch   commentary this be the first time that the NTSB have lead an investigation into a space launch their leadership be request by the Department of Commerce 's Office of Commercial Space Transportation who have license the commercial launch at the time of write this column some of the initial investigation have be conclude and some of the result be start to leak out into the trade press apparently 3 or four different communication channel be in use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stop respond the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island give abort order about a minute before the launch accord to the mission rule this should have stop the launch somehow the OSC test conductor order the abort reversed and the NASA communicator on the net relay that order to the B-52 carry the Pegasus at about 22 second before launch differ explaination of exactly how this happen be propose with the well set be that clear line of communication and clear definition of the responsibility of the mission control team and understanding of the mission rule be not establish before the launch as we see more and more commercial launch more of these procedural issue be go to crop up and will have to be resolve this case be interesting because it be the first time the NTSB have be call in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they do with commercial aircraft problem I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problem with procedure and communication and will be clear up with issuance of guideline on how launch communication should be set up and how specific line of authority should be delineate   7- another PEGASUS competitor be ANNOUNCED Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announce it be market a new small space launch system base upon convert icbm component two version of the launcher be be market the Aerokosmos wing vehicle launch like the OSC Pegasus and the Severkosmos launch from a mobile ground transporter the Aerokosmos be project to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbit and 225 kg to 800 km also propose to be use with these launch system be a LEO data relay system call sineva Tsniimach Enterprise be describe as a ex military establishment focus on aerodynamic and thermal protection of spacecraft and which have participate in the development of the Buran shuttle system they be locate near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow   Commentary There 's very little release information on this new venture my suspicion be it be another russian enterprise look for hard currency and try to capitalize upon their in house knowledge of ex soviet launch system it add to the list of numerous commercial space startup announce from the ex Soviet Union this one 's a little different in that they be offer variant of ex soviet icbm but I ca n't identify any key customer be targeted or substantial financial backing   8- GEORGIA LAUNCH site DROPPED from plan in late January Georgia Tech Research Institute release the result of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launch site in Camden County Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast the preliminary study recommend the site not be pursue as a commercial launch site state reopen the site be not feasible due to project low investment return plus environmental and other geographic consideration however the report do say the site might be ideal for other aerospace use and recommend other potential use   Commentary this should put the nail in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site while other site be still proceed with commercial launch site development plan Kingsland find without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure have to be put in then the expect return be too low to justify the cost of development this might point out some key discriminator in judge the feasibility of a commercial launch site these include be there an identify key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup cost be there a market advantage of use the site can exist infrastructure be use or modify at the site can financing be find at low enough cost to support the investment other commercial launch site venture include those at Woomera Poker Flat Cape York White Sands Alabama Off Shore Platform Hawaii and Vandenberg have to also be judge against these criterion in my opinion some of these venture be fly on hope and speculation and not on sound financial ground   9- SPAIN 's CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER still proceed in one of his last official act former President Bush authorize space technology transfer for several joint space venture between US and other firm one of these be a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster with that regulatory impediment remove the 3 stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year plan for a first launch in the 199596 time period the Capricornia be describe as a small 3 stage all solid booster design to put 250 500 Kg into LEO several launch site be be examine for the system include 2 on the iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands originate by INTA in Spain the project report it have   30 M in development funding and will use technology from Argentina 's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US   Commentary several firm have identify a market opportunity in provide a small launcher for the european market small payload from european firm or organization currently use either ariane piggyback launch or the US   italian Scout launcher however Ariane piggyback opportunity be limited and the Scout program be be phase out accompany by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regard any follow on system this have leave an apparent niche for a new european small launch system surprisingly enough ESA have not support development of such a system within the current space funding structure study have be perform by British Aerospace Aerospatiale Deutsche Aerospace and italian organization but with the exception of the Swedish   PacAstro system report below I have not be able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware also of interest be the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher there have be some interesting rumor surface out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher   IRBM program fund under the military junta which rule the country in the 1970 's and early 1980 's what be know be in Feb 1992 the Argentinian Air Force formally transfer control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales CNAE the Condor 2 program be describe as originate in 1983 expand upon the small Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of german firm the Condor 2 be also reportedly fund indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980 's fairly large solid rocket motor be build and test but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lag that of the propulsion system it should be note CNAE be plan to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994 the us 9 M 181 Kg SAC B satellite will study the Earth 's upper atmosphere and include cooperative experiment from Italy and the US no launch vehicle have yet be select but OSC 's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launch rocket be report to be strong contender for this contract   10- pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish SPACE CORP PacAstro a small launch firm in Herndon Virginia announce in late February it have receive a   6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro 's PA-2 launch vehicle this will be perform as part of the Polar Satellite Service PSS a joint Norwegian Space Center Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offer small satellite launch into the polar region accord to PacAstro PSS be also perform an   8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facility include a new integration facility and a fully- enclose vertical assembly building for small launch vehicle like the PacAstro pa-2 PacAstro have be choose as the main alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service to be offer by PSS from Andoya the date of the launch of the swedish satellite be not specify   Commentary PacAstro have be try to line up customer and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now the pa-2 be a small two stage rocket fuel by rp-1 and Liquid Oxygen from PacAstro 's literature the engine design for the PA series rocket be build of off the shelf component base upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines build by TRW and be capable of put a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit PacAstro be try to arrange construction financing for its first three pa-2 vehicle with a first launch plan for 1995 and 2 orbital launch plan for 1996 my record show PacAstro hire TRW to provide marketing support and system design with primary engineering to be do by AeroAstro a small satellite builder closely associate with PacAstro headquarter in the same building the Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering launch operation vehicle subsystem and marketing support Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo be a first round investor and sit on the board of director PacAstro have get a first round financial package of at least   550 k some source place this of high as   1 m but have be search for about a year for the additional   20 30 M need to design build and launch their first set of vehicle the launch reservation from SSC can possibly be use to help bring some investor on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single   6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware   11- CHINA and TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE report in early March it be report a joint satellite communication venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese be in the work as report in the Taipei press China Development Corp. CDC headquarter in Taiwam and with link to the rule Nationalist Party be plan to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launch a regional communication satellite CDC would cover about 10 of the satellite system cost US   10 M in exchange for right to 10 of the satellite 's communication channel   Commentary this announcement come close on the heel of the release of taiwanese plan for space development release in mid January in those plan the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellite start with ROCSAT-1 a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft plan for launch in 1997 two additional satellite be plan both communication satellite TRW have be help Taiwan plan this program budget at T13.6 B US   530 M through 2006 I have n't be able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT but there might be a connection while Taiwan have the financing to pursue several venture the current taiwanese telecommunication market might not support two separate sastellite venture the report name for the Tiawanese   chinese system be Asiasat- 2 but I do n't think this have any relationship with the exist Hong Kong base Asiasat program involve Chinese Hong Kong and other asian investor other than use it as an organizational model there be some obvious advantage to pursue such a joing venture it could provide excellent first hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost which then can be use in late satellite venture but there be internal political issue between taiwanese and chinese venture but put any joint venture through a Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed in any case the east asian satellite market be light up with substantially growth project in space service and revenue this be just another indicator to add to the list   12- south KOREA announces national MOVE into SPACE TECHNOLOGIES South Korea 's Trade Industry and Resources Ministry recently announce plan to invest us 22 b in research and development and another us 17 b into manufacturing and research facility for advanced aerospace technology space technology have be specifically target as part of this program begin with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi purpose satellite by 1997 the objective of this investment be to raise South Korea 's aerospace technology to the level of the world 's top 10 country by 2000   Commentary South Korea have be quietly work to develop its national aerospace industry specifically include space activity I 'm note this as a flag that potential new player be come into the commercial space market as part of their national effort 2 national telecommunication satellite for Korea Telecom will be launch in April and Oct 1995 on Delta Designated Koreasat 1 and 2 the platform will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula southwestern Japan and portion of China border North Korea South Korea launch its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992 call Uribyol-1 our Star and cost about US   8.8 M. Uribyol-2 be plan for piggyback launch in October of this year again on Ariane and will be entirely make in Korea Uribyol-3 project for a 1995 launch will be an environment- monitor micro satellite this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellite the KEOS Korean Earth Observation System project which have be submit for approval to the south korean government would use two or three 300 kg spacecraft equip with optical and microwave sensor south korean press report claim there be also a parallel military effort to establish the capability for building and launch small military satellite by 2001 supposedly a government panel have be establish to oversee such an effort fund at US   500 M between 1993 and 2001 in anticipation of an expect pullout of U.S. intelligence gather system from the korean peninsula in conjunction with all of these report effort south Korean be also pursue production work either as off set to exist aerospace technology contract for example McDonnell Douglas be offset production of some Delta part to south korean firm as part of the Koreasat launch contract or for production of consumer space item among other product South Korea export satellite receiver television setup to Japan and Samsung have announce team for production of OSC 's Orbcomm user terminal this look like a very aggressive push into space technology consider that East Asia be currently the fast grow sector for commercial space service primarily for telecommunication a south korean push into space technology may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES through MARCH as announce in the last CSN   STI each issue will give the result of stock index and portfolio regard space stock and investment the table below summarize result to the end of March the Space Technology Index do quite a bit well than the market as a whole as represent by the SP 500 index since 90 of the value include in the index be US firm this represent a general increase in the market value of space relate firm the increase in the first quarter be more than in all of 1992 which be a very promising sign although future month may reverse this trend the Commercial Space Technology Index have also do quite well but the Pure Play portfolio consist of stock of firm which be pure play in space technology have also surpass its result in all of 1993 we 'll keep an eye on these INDEX result through MARCH beginning beginning 1 Jan 93 to 1992 1993 31 Mar 1993 SP 500 416 436 4.7 452 3.7 Space Tech Index 267 304 13.6 373 22.7 Comm'l Space Tech Index 167 194 16.3 222 14.2 Space Tech Pure play 147 169 15.4 197 16.2 FINAL NOTES what this column 's already full and I still have bunche of commercial space development to report on as I say at the start of this column there 's be a lot of interesting happening but I 'll have to put they into the next issue look ahead I 've get several article in the work on new happening with Iridium and the LEO communication satellite market more news on international launcher appear and disappear on the market new international commercial space venture and other interesting development and as always I hope you folk find this stuff useful and interesting any and all comment be welcome;2

1697;Tony- while I honestly believe you believe you be do a good thing by post that piece of propaganda I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay orient people I have see the film call the Gay Agenda and along with my church we find it to be horrify not because of what be actually show cleaver use of editte can create any image one want to portray rather becaseu we be familia familiar with how widely it be actively distribute and how many naive people be actually believe the garbage find within it the truth be that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who call themself gay but know as many as I do and know their testimony and witness thi faith and life I have to say that the report you post be a very biased report something obviously claim against gay as well the truth be that unless you be innately gay you can not know what harm you be cause I speak as an abolitionist who support affirm gay right in our society I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentation perpetrate by Christian Fundamentalist extremist but I know people who be not the sexual deviant your report paint they to be it be no mistake that the APA remove homosexuality from it 's list of mental illness it be also no mistake that there be many Christians and homophobe who long to bring it back to the list I do not feel threaten by gay I do n't understand why other be the following be an article concern two of the more popular ex gay min- istrie Exodus International   Homosexuals Anonymous the founder of an EX GAY support GROUP choose HOMO over HETERO by Robert Pela from Gay orient magazine ADVOCATE in December 1985 David Caligiuri receive one of the Advocate 's homophobia rewaa award the A Prayer A Day keep the Lust Away citation as director of FREE indeed a national ex gay ministry Caligiuri be single out for offer discontent gay and lesbian a way out of the homosexual death style through prayer i 'd like to give the award back Caligiuri now laugh I 'm no long deserve it Caligiuri 's eight year involvement with the national ex gay movement peak with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous HA as well as Free indeed he have since abandon his pulpit and now say that the ex- gay movement be a fruitless effort base on deception There 's no reality in it he say I be sell a product and my product be a lie head up by national ministry like Exodus International and Courage the organization of the ex gay movement rely on the tenent of bear again Christianity to convince disatisfie homosexual usually young gay man who be just come out that they can shed their sexuality by suppress their sexual urge and embrace Christianity we offer support to people who be seek to leave the sin of homosexuality explain Bob Davies director of Exodus he venture that about 80 of those seek to abandon their homo- sexuality be man anybody who be involve in the ex gay ministry be misguide and be waste their time say Lisa Seeley a former redeem lesbian who work with Caligiuri as HA and appear with he on the Sally Jessy Raphael show these organization be for people who be spiritually and emotionally wound It 's possible to change your identity or your behavior say sex educator Brian McNaught author of   on be Gay   but it 's really impossible to change your orientation these people be no long call themselves gay but they continue to have same sex erotic feeling Caligiuri say he found Free indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell break loose in his personal life a few day after his lover end both their romance and their business partnership Caligiuri be sexually assault by a man he pick up in a bar I be really drunk he recall and I go home with this guy he tie I up and rape I he leave I tie up all night and the next morning he rape I again when Caligiuri be eventually free by the attacker he return home to the home he share with his ex lover he have another man there with he Caligiuri recall I think at this time If this be what be gay be about I do n't want to be this way anymore Caligiuri vow that if he could find a way out he would share his discovery with other he organize an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix 's gay pride parade in June 1985 and a few month later Free indeed hold its first public protest at a meeting to promote a gay civil right ordinance Free indeed member loudly blast gay tell they ther be sinner head for hell Free indeed begin receive about a hundred telephone call a week thank in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow page we be list under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services Caligiuri say so people think we be a gay information switchboard People would call to find out where the local bar be and we 'd preach to they about the sin of homo- sexuality ruse like this be typical of the movement Caligiuri say add They 'll do anything to reach these people David use to go on radio and say really stupid thing recall Peter Kelly a counselor at Phoenix 's Catholic diocese AIDS program like that he know he be gay when he start wear pastel color Caligiuri 's family first find out about his ministry when they see he on Raphael 's syndicate talk show in 1985 they be relieve he recall they figure that if they have to have a gay person in the family well that I should be a reformed gay person but Caligiuri be hardly reform by the time I appear on Sally 's show I 'd start have sex with man again man would call our hotline and tell I about thier late sin sex with their pastor sex with their father I be horny all the time unable to risk go to gay bar where he might be recognize from his numerous television appearance Caligiuri say he use to go to bookstore and get blowjob when he was n't work the bookstore he be sleep with other reform homosexual I did n't realize it at first but a lot of the ha leader be have sex with one another Caligiuri say we 'd go to conference in other city and we 'd be pair up in hotel room everybody be sleep with everybody else by the time he appear on AM Philadelphia television show in May 1988 Caligiuri be have anonymous sex a couple time a week when the show 's host ask he if he ever act on temptation his answer be a lie Caligiuri 's duplicity begin to take it 's toll on he however he be suffer from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis a dibilitating yeast infection and this lead to his escape from the sect I be too sick to go to church he explain the more time I spend away from those people the more I begin to feel like myself I begin to remember who I use to be late in 1991 Caligiuri turn Free indeed phone line over to a local church and close the ministry 's door i 'd convince myself that there be no need in the world for ex gay people he say today Caligiuri 31 be study alternative spirituality I 'm interest- ed in belief system that are n't judgemental consider romance but not with a CHristian and search for a new project to devote himself to I feel compel to commit myself to gay cause he say I want to eventually stop feel guilty about what I do and make up for the damage I may have bring to our community ---end article--- Caligiuri 's tory be by no mean unique and I have read several other article of former leader and founder of ex gay ministry who have say very similar th similar thing fortuantely not all of they have leave Christianity but have come to realize that God love they despite the attitude of other some like Chris Glaser director of the Presbyterian Lazarus Project of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually be work with the gay community to bring they into the sheepfold of Christ and encourage real ethical value of sexuality within the sphere of be gay I have also as I say talk and become and become close friend with many who once attend such group as Love in action and other who either once claim to have be reform or who be too honest with themselves to live a lie no matter who be disappoint in they some be even encourage to marry as a way of seal their new heterosexuality only to eventually start hit the bar bathhouse and bookstore since these be usually activity under the concealment of night and one night stand of promiscuous behavior mean no continuous sin through a committed relationship this be a horrible trap which the CHurch have dump on the back of the truly gay oriented people and the very inno- cent victim in these case be the wife and child of such marriage yet the church insist that there be only two option they be willing to allow gay people 1 heterosexuality or 2 celebacy this be sad what be also mrtifye be in the case of those who can not suppress their desire and fear for thi sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church force on they they may even opt for suicide or surgical dampering of the brain function in the past lobotomy and heavey drug suppressant be common- place there be now become available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gay such as Sylvia Pennington 's   Ex Gays there be none   and other there be also a great many fact base book be write to help people trap in this confusion such as Maury Johnston 's   Gays under Grace   and Chris Glaser 's   Come Hom   I seriously recommend those for people seek help for this persecution and self acceptance;3

1701;I think many read this group would also benefit by know how deviant the view   as I 've articulate it above   which may not be the true view of Khomeini be from the basic principle of Islam so that the non muslim reader of this group will see how far from the simple basic of Islam such view be on the face of they and if they be   not   in contradiction with the basic of Islam how subtle such issue be and how it seem sect exist in Islam while they be explicitly proscribe by the Qur'an in my opinion consider any human being as have a substance or metaphysical fundamentally different from that of any other human being   be   a heretical notion and one proscribe by Islam absolutely I would be interested in discuss this privately and I be interested in hear how one might try to make the concept of error free and sinless human being philosophically consistent with the teaching of the Qur'an however   prima facie   such attemptsa be highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery explicitly proscribe by the Qur'an Alaikum Wassalam;0

filter high pass low pass edge enhancing median generic Complex Histogram   Contrast control Layer Controller manage up to 64 image at a time user can extract single band from a 3 band image or create color image by combine various individual band etc the package be design for a remote sense application it can handle very large image and there be all kind of other software available for gis application Host Configuration Requirements it run on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun though there be rumor there be always rumor that the software would be port to pc and possibly a Sun environment PCI a company call PCI Inc. out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada make an array of software utility for processing manipulation and use of remote sense datum in eight or ten different industry standard format LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of other whose title I forget the software be available in version for MS DOS Unix workstation among they HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly other platform by now I use the VMS version the PCI software consist of several class   group   package of utility group by function but all operate on a common pci database disk file the Tape I   o package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote sense industry tape format INTO or write those format out from the PCI database file- this be the only package I use or know much about other package can display datum from the PCI database to one or another of several pci support third party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image datum to an attached printer e.g. an Epson type dot matrix graphic printer you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operation package histo- gram and Fourier analysis equalization user specify operation e.g. multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and God only know what all else there 's a LOT I do n't have and do n't use these so ca n't say much about them- you only buy the package your particular application   interest call for each utility be control by from one to eight parameter read from a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default directory some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing set up a series of operation the standard PCI environment contain a scripting language very similar to IBM pc BASIC but which allow you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in VMS I can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure There 's also an optional programming library which allow you to write compile language program which can interface with read from   write to the PCI datum structure database file parameter file the PCI software be design specifically for remote sense image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing as well for instance the Tape I   o package offer a utility for read headerless multi band what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh call raw datum from tape in a number of different interleave order this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic art industry 's CT2 T format would probably I have n't try handle Targa and so on above all however you have to know what YOU'RE do or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over It 's worth note that the PCI database file be design to contain not only raster image datum but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land use and all manner of other information I observe that a remote sense image tape often contain all manner of information about the spectral band latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass- all of this can go into the PCI database I   believe   that on workstation the build in display be use on VAX system other than workstation pci support only a couple of specific third party display system the name Gould   Deanza seem to come to mind one of MY personal workaround be a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a Peritek VCT Q Q bus 24 bit DirectColor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case- it seems design for the very high end application   user i.e. those for whom a Mac   PC largely does n't suffice although as you know the gap be get small all the time It 's probably no coincidence that PCI be locate in Canada a country which do a LOT of its land   resource management via remote sensing- I believe the canadian government use PCI software for some of its work in these area SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager back in 1985 JPL develop something call SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager which get a fair amount of use at the time that be design for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery byte datum    256 pixel across by    512 line by    256 bands)- a modify version have since be develop for AVIRIS Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer which use much large image Spam do none of these thing rectification classification pc and IHS transformation filtering contrast enhancement overlay actually it do limit filtering and contrast enhancement stretching Spam be aim at spectral identification and clustering the original Spam use X or SunView to display the AVIRIS version may require VICAR an executive base on TAE and may also require a frame buffer I can refer you to people if you 're interested PCW require x for display MAP II among the Mac gis system MAP II be distribute by John Wiley CLRview clrview be a 3 dimensional visualization program design to exploit the real time

1758;I think this be a weak argument the fact be there be   two   reference to Jesus in   antiquity of the Jews   one of which have unquestionably at least be alter by Christians Origen write in the third century that Josephus do not recognize Jesus as the Messiah while the long passage say the opposite there be an arabic manuscript of   antiquity of the Jews   which contain a version of the passage which be much less gung ho for Jesus and may be authentic there be no question that Origen in the third century see a reference to Jesus in Josephus there be no manuscript of   antiquity   which lack the reference it be possible that it be fabricate out of whole cloth and insert but I do n't think it 's very likely nor do I think there be a consensus in the scholarly community that this be the case I know G.A. Wells take this position but that be because he take the very small minority view that Jesus never exist and he be a professor of German not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus;3

1783;what do you mean by omnipotent here do you mean by omnipotent that God should be able to do anything   everything this create a self contradictory definition of omnipotence which be effectively useless to be descriptive omnipotence must mean be all powerful and not be able to do anything   everything let I illustrate by analogy suppose the United States be the only nuclear power on earth suppose far that the US military could not effectively be counter by any nation or group of nation the US have the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten thing out as the leader of the US see fit the US would be militarily omnipotent but suppose far that the US hold to a doctrine   philosophy of not interfere in the internal affair of any nation such as the current civil war in the former yugoslavian state Technically in this scenario the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess but effectively the US could not intervene without violate its own policy of non interference if the policy of non interference be hold to strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would ever be violate effectively the US would be limit in what it could actually do although it have the power to do whatever it want the US would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leader give such an inviolate non interference policy God be effectively limit in the same sense he be all powerful but he can not use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what he himself be I hope this help to clear up some of the misunderstanding concern omnipotence regard;0

1798;let I begin by say I think this be the world 's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium therefore even if this religion do not take off its found member will be very important historically as this method of solicit membership will eventually become common the basis of this religion be to apply various aspect of current conventional morality to the character in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the bible 's account of the fact and historical event be correct for example Story of Adam and Eve Adam and Eve be in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant have unlimited supply of food provide but no clothing job or knowledge God say not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge they do anyway then try to hide in bush God find they and force they out of Garden there be several different story on what they be do while naked in the bush that might have anger God Traditional Philosophy 1 the only reason you need knowledge or a job be to eat if someone else will provide you with food then you can be stupid and unemployed and it 's ok this be why married woman usually did n't work until recent decade 2 authority figure such as God whoever be behind the Vietnam War Hitler and slaveowner be always right and should be blindly follow without question by ordinary people who ca n't make decision for themselves interpretation of event base on Traditional Philosophy they be not suppose to eat the fruit they should have do whatever God tell they to like small child they have their need provide for and be obligate to do whatever their Father say to be force to leave the Garden and work in order to obtain food be a punishment lesson from Traditional Interpretation 1 ignorance be good Knowledge be bad but tempting 2 have food provide for you for nothing read welfare be ideal get- te a job and feed yourself with what you earn be punishment 3 public nudity be good cover up be bad 4 Authority figure be intrinsically right normal people be dumb and should do whatever they be tell without question they should not think for themselves 5 People in subordinate position be especially obligate to refrain from learn for example it should be illegal for slave to learn to read 1990 's philosophy 1 People should seek education and employment outside the home unless name Hillary Clinton or Murphy Brown 2 People should use common sense they should not kill other people bind of Issac war Holocaust etc just because they be tell to Interpretation of event base on current philosophy they be suppose to eat the fruit God gave want they to seek knowledge rather than be hand it on a silver platter once they have gain knowledge and by seek it show their ability to make mature decision for them- self they no long need to be treat like little child and be rewarded by be allow into the real world lesson from new interpretation 1 ignorance be bad Knowledge be good but must be seek 2 have food provide for you for nothing read welfare be at good a temporary measure get a job and feed yourself with what you earn be ideal 3 public nudity be bad cover up be good 4 Authority figure be often wrong normal people be intelligent and should consider whether the instruction be really a good idea and alter or abolish bad government they should think for themselves 5 People in subordinate decision be often discourage from knowledge but should seek it anyway and all the hard for example poor child without good school should work especially hard in order to make a well life for their child and themselves I have tentatively name this new philosophy the Church of Eveism because Eve 's decision to eat the apple be mansickind 's first good decision instead of its first bad one as traditionally believe she be therefore clearly a protagonist God at first appear evil for tell people not to seek knowledge but on deep analysis be also a protagonist as God reward the decision to defy he and provide the tree in the first place the intention and desire be clearly to have the knowledge be obtain but to delay it until it be actively seek ---end serious discussion begin humor.-- save this post to disk or file server someday it will be consider the most important writing since the 10 Commandments you want an original copy stay tune for the RFD on soc.religion.eveism can I get a tax deduction for money I donate to this organization --return to serious discussion when post follow ups.--;3

stand for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the committee that write the standard JPEG be design for compress either full color or gray scale digital image of natural real world scene it do not work so well on non realistic image such as cartoon or line drawing JPEG do not handle black and white 1 bit per pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name JBIG and mpeg respectively JPEG be lossy mean that the image you get out of decompression is n't quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieve much of its compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail are n't perceive as well as small detail of light and dark thus JPEG be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine analyze your image the small error introduce by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of JPEG be that the degree of lossiness can be vary by adjust compression parameter this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make   extremely   small file if you do n't mind poor quality- this be useful for indexing image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept less compression   2   why use JPEG there be two good reason to make your image file small and to store 24 bit per pixel color datum instead of 8 bit per pixel datum make image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archiving library of image be able to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 Kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare GIF and JPEG the size ratio be more like four to one More detail below if your view software does n't support JPEG directly you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for view or manipulating image even with a jpeg capable viewer it take long to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simple format GIF for instance thus use JPEG be essentially a time   space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply It 's worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a short file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format be that JPEG can store full color information 24 bit   pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or few color if you have only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though 8 bit GIF will look as obsolete as black and white MacPaint format do today furthermore for reason detail in section 7 JPEG be far more useful than GIF for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware hence JPEG be considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet post standard   3   when should I use jpeg and when should I stick with GIF JPEG be   not   go to displace GIF entirely- for some type of image GIF be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about JPEG be which kind of image to apply it to as a rule of thumb JPEG be superior to GIF for store full color or gray scale image of realistic scenes- that mean scan photograph and similar material JPEG be superior even if you do n't have 24 bit display hardware and it be a LOT superior if you do see section 7 for detail GIF do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such as cartoon and line drawing in particular large area of pixel that be all   exactly   the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by GIF JPEG ca n't squeeze these file as much as GIF do without introduce visible defect this sort of image be well keep in GIF form in particular single color border be quite cheap in GIF file but they should be avoid in JPEG file JPEG also have a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure black pixel adjacent to a row of pure white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing be not find in scanned photograph but it show up fairly often in GIF file border overlaid text etc the blurriness be particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixel high if you have a GIF with a lot of small size overlaid text do n't jpeg it computer draw image ray trace scene for instance usually fall between scanned image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it the same go for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such plain black and white two level image should never be convert to JPEG you need at least about 16 gray level before JPEG be useful for gray scale image it should also be note that GIF be lossless for gray scale image of up to 256 level while JPEG be not if you have an exist library of GIF image you may wonder whether you should convert they to JPEG you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argue that jpeg image quality be superior to GIF only apply if both format start from a full color original if you start from a GIF you 've already irretrievably lose a great deal of information- jpeg can only make thing bad however the disk space saving may justify convert anyway this be a decision you 'll have to make for yourself if you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hint be prepared to leave some image in GIF format since some gif will not convert well   4   how well do JPEG compress image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image I have handy a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purposes- the rest be create with the free jpeg software describe in section 6B. filet Size in bytesttcomment ship.ppmt1145040 original file in PPM format no compression- 24 bit ttt or 3 byte per pixel plus a few byte overhead ship.ppm Zt 963829 PPM file pass through Unix compress ttt compress does n't accomplish a lot you 'll note ttt other text orient compressor give similar result ship.gift 240438 convert to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256   ppmtogif ttt Most of the saving be the result of lose color ttt info GIF save 8 bit   pixel not 24 see sec 7 ship.jpg95 t 155622 cjpeg -q 95 high useful quality set ttt this be indistinguishable from the 24 bit original ttt at least to my nonprofessional eyeball ship.jpg75 t 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 default setting ttt you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this ttt from the original even with both on screen at once ship.jpg50 t 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 ttt this have slight defects- if you know what to look ttt for you could tell it 's be JPEGed without see ttt the original still as good image quality as many ttt recent posting in Usenet picture group ship.jpg25 t 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 ttt jpeg 's characteristic blockiness become apparent ttt at this setting djpeg -blocksmooth help some ttt still I 've see plenty of Usenet posting that be ttt of poor image quality than this ship.jpg5ot 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize -optimize cut table overhead ttt Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or ttt indexing purpose note that this file be TINY ttt the compression ratio from the original be 173:1 in this case jpeg can make a file that be a factor of four or five small than a GIF of comparable quality the -q 75 file be every bit as good as the GIF well if you have a full color display this seem to be a typical ratio for real world scene   5   what be good quality setting for jpeg Most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by select a quality setting there seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting Quality 95 do not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claim the quality scale be purely arbitrary- it be not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use JPEG be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompress into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality setting -Q 75 be very often the good choice this setting be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try -q 75 first- if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above -Q 95- say -Q 100 will produce a file two or three time as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any well quality if the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a high quality set to avoid further degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gif to JPEG the default -Q 75 be about right for compress 24 bit image but -Q 85 to 95 be usually well for convert gif see section 14 for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 be about right -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art note the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free jpeg software describe in section 6b and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program do n't even provide a numeric scale just high   medium   low style choice   6   where can I get JPEG software Most of the program describe in this section be available by FTP if you do n't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article how to find source if you do n't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in news.answer or you can get it by send e mail to mail-serverrtfm.mit.edu with send usenet   news.answer   finding source in the body the Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful it 's usenet   news.answer   ftp list   faq in the news.answer archive note this list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late JPEG FAQ from the news.answer archive   6a   if you be look for can software viewer etc the first part of this list be system specific program that only run on one kind of system if you do n't see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software describe at the end of the list note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over Internet- but some commercial program be list too X Windows John Bradley 's free XV version 2.00 and up be an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and other image format It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu the file be call xv-???.tar Z where be the version number currently 2.21)- it be locate in the contrib directory on export or the pub   xv directory at upenn XV reduce all image to 8 bit internally which mean it be not a real good choice if you have a 24 bit display you 'll still get only 8 bit color also you should n't use XV to convert full color image to jpeg because they 'll get color quantize first but XV be a fine tool for convert GIF and other 8 bit image to jpeg caution there be a glitch in version 2.21 and early be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x Windows be John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   ImageMagick.tar Z. this package handle many image processing and conversion task the ImageMagick viewer handle 24 bit display correctly- for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support JPEG in its late release 3.03 xloadimage be free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xloadimage.3.03.tar Z. xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by its fan to be somewhat fast and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed fast and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it have the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 be use a hack over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xli.1.14.tar Z. both program be say to do the right thing with 24 bit display MS DOS this cover plain dos- for Windows or os2 program see the next heading one good choice be Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG which view JPEG and GIF file the current version 2.4a be available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca 129.97.50.50 file pub   jpeg   viewer   dvpeg24a.zip this be a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386486 machine the user interface be not flashy but it 's functional another freeware JPEG   GIF   TGA viewer be Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview the current version 1.2 be available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   hv12.zip Hiview require a 386 or well cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager QEMM386 and 386max work- Windows and os2 do not Hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen for large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning   scroll as most viewer do you may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no deny that it slow down loading of large image considerably note installation be a bit tricky- read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be ColorView for DOS   30 this be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative its user interface be also much spiffier look although personally I find it hard to use more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be fast than DVPEG but a little slow than Hiview at least on my hardware for image large than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both be fast than Hiview the current version be 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   dcview21.zip require a vesa graphic driver- if you do n't have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory many recent pc have a build in vesa driver so do n't try to load a vesa driver unless ColorView complain that the driver be miss a second shareware alternative be Fullview which have be kick around the net for a while but I do n't know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway the author tell I that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the Simtel20 archive at that time the well know GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW support JPEG in its late revision 8.60a however CSHOW 's jpeg implementation is n't very good it 's slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi color display too bad it 'd have be nice to see a good jpeg capability in CSHOW Shareware   25 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   gif   cshw860a.zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic hardware any one of these viewer might not work on your particular machine if you ca n't get   any   of they to work you 'll need to use one of the following conversion program to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer if you have hi color hardware do n't use GIF as the intermediate format- try to find a targa capable viewer instead VPIC5.0 be repute to do the right thing with hi color display the Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converter be ftpable from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   jpeg4.zip or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory these file be DOS compilation of the free source code describe in section 6b- they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM format Handmade Software offer free JPEGGIF conversion tool GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF these be slow and be limit to conversion to and from GIF format- in particular you ca n't get 24 bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tool be that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary jpeg format as well as the Usenet standard JFIF format since HSI format file be rather widespread on BBSes this be a useful capability Version 2.0 of these tool be free prior version be shareware get it from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   gif2jpg2.zip note do not use HSI format for file to be post on Internet since it be not readable on non pc platform Handmade Software also have a shareware image conversion and manipulation package Image Alchemy this will translate jpeg file both JFIF and HSI format to and from many other image format it can also display image a demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 be available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   alch161.zip note about simtel20 the Internet 's key archive site for pc relate program be Simtel20 full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil 192.88.110.20 Simtel20 run a non unix system with weird directory names- where this document refer to directory eg msdo   graphic at Simtel20 that really mean pd1 msdos.graphics   if you be not physically on MILnet you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rate from Simtel20 there be several internet site that maintain copy mirror of the Simtel20 archives- most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead a popular USA mirror site be oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117 which keep Simtel20 file in eg pub   msdo   graphic if you have no FTP capability you can retrieve file from Simtel20 by e mail- see informational posting in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how if you be outside the USA consult the same newsgroup to learn where your near Simtel20 mirror be Microsoft Windows there be several Windows program capable of display JPEG image Windows viewer be generally slow than DOS viewer on the same hardware due to Windows system overhead note that you can run the DOS conversion program describe above inside a Windows DOS window the new entry be WinECJ which be free and EXTREMELY fast Version 1.0 be available from ftp.rahul.net file pub   bryanw   pc   jpeg   wecj.zip require Windows 3.1 and 256 or more color mode this be a no frill viewer with the bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decodes- and the image quality be noticeably bad than other viewer but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway at least for previewing JView be freeware fairly fast have good on line help and can write out the decompress image in Windows BMP format- but it ca n't create new jpeg file and it does n't view gif JView also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer such as brightness adjustment but it be an excellent basic viewer the current version 0.9 be available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.84 file pub   pc   win3   desktop   jview090.zip mirror of this archive can be find at some other internet site include wuarchive.wustl.edu WinJPEG shareware   20 display JPEG GIF Targa TIFF and BMP image files- it can write all of these format too so it can be use as a converter it have some other nifty feature include color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version be 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE above file msdo   windows3   winjp210.zip this be a slow 286 compatible version- if you register you 'll get the 386 only version which be roughly 25 fast ColorView be another shareware entry   30 this be an early and promising contender but it have not be update in some time and at this point it have no real advantage over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version be 0.97 available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu file pub   pc   win3   desktop   cview097.zip I understand that a new version will be appear once the author be finish with ColorView for DOS DVPEG see DOS heading also work under Windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os2 the following file be available from hobbes.nmsu.edu 128.123.35.151 note check pub   upload for more recent version the hobbe

Shareware   20 Macintosh Most Mac jpeg program rely on Apple 's jpeg implementation which be part of the QuickTime system extension- so you need to have quicktime instal to use QuickTime you need a 68020 or well cpu and you need to be run System 6.0.7 or later if you 're run System 6 you must also install the 32 bit QuickDraw extension- this be build in on System 7 you can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   quicktime.hqx as of 1192 this file contain QuickTime 1.5 which be well than QT 1.0 in several way with respect to jpeg it be marginally fast and considerably less prone to crash when feed a corrupt jpeg file however some application seem to have compatibility problem with QT 1.5 Mac user should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format PICT   JPEG be not the same as the Usenet standard JFIF JPEG format see section 10 for detail if you post image on Usenet make sure they be in JFIF format Most of the program mention below can generate either format the first choice be probably jpegview a free program for view image that be in JFIF format PICT   JPEG format or GIF format it also can convert between the two JPEG format the current version 2.0 be a big improvement over prior version get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 file info mac   app   jpeg view-20.hqx require System 7 and QuickTime on 8 bit display jpegview usually produce the good color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewer jpegview can view large image in much less memory than other Mac viewers- in fact it 's the only one that can deal with jpeg image much over 640x480 pixel on a typical 4 MB Mac give a large image jpegview automatically scale it down to fit on the screen rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer you can zoom in on any desire portion though some people like this behavior some do n't Overall JPEGView 's user interface be very well think out GIFConverter a shareware   40 image viewer   converter support JFIF and PICT   JPEG as well as GIF and several other image format the late version be 2.3.2 get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   art   gif   gif converter-232.hqx Requires System 6.0.5 or later GIFConverter be not well than JPEGView as a plain jpeg   GIF viewer but it have much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image also the new version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF image   without   QuickTime so it be your good bet if your machine be too old to run QuickTime but it 's fast with QuickTime note if GIFConverter run out of memory try to load a large jpeg try convert the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then view the GIF version JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utility be available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   jpeg convert-10.hqx this will run on any Mac but it only do file conversion not view you can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer previous version of this FAQ recommend Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEGGIF converter base on an old version of the IJG code if you be use this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert Apple 's free program PictPixie can view image in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these format you can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   qt.1.0.stuff   pictpixie.hqx require QuickTime PictPixie be intend as a developer 's tool and it 's really not the good choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime some of its drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface bad PictPixie be an unsupported program mean it have some minor bug that Apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of PictPixie call PICTCompressor float around the net if you have this you should trash it as it 's even buggy also the QuickTime Starter Kit include a much clean up descendant of PictPixie call Picture Compressor note that Picture Compressor be not free and may not be distribute on the net storm technology 's Picture Decompress be a free JPEG viewer   converter this rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be force to use it on old system it do need 32 bit QuickDraw so really old machine ca n't use it you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   picture decompress-201.hqx you must set the file type of a download image file to jpeg to allow Picture Decompress to open it if your machine be too old to run 32 bit QuickDraw a Mac plus for instance GIFConverter be your only choice for single program JPEG view if you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer More and more commercial Mac application be support jpeg although not all can deal with the Usenet standard JFIF format Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF format jpeg file use the JPEG plug in from the Acquire menu you must set the file type of a download jpeg file to jpeg to allow Photoshop to recognize it Amiga Most program list in this section be store in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch 130.60.80.80 there be many mirror site of this archive

quantization Most people do n't have full color 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 or few bit per pixel so it can display 256 or few distinct color at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color this process be call color quantization this be something of a misnomer color selection would be a well term we 're stick with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy process it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by JPEG except at the very low jpeg quality setting since JPEG be a full color format convert a color jpeg image for display on 8 bit or less hardware require color quantization this be true for   all   color jpeg even if you feed a 256 or less color GIF into JPEG what come out of the decompressor be   not   256 color but thousand of color this happen because JPEG 's lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get smear into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be always require to display a color jpeg on a colormappe display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a JPEG image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference I occasionally see post image describe as 256 color jpeg this tell I that the poster a has n't read this FAQ and b probably convert the jpeg from a GIF jpeg can be classify as color or gray scale just like photograph but number of color just is n't a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a GIF image by definition have already be quantize to 256 or few color a GIF   do   have a definite number of color in its palette and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entry for purpose of Usenet picture distribution GIF have the advantage that the sender precompute the color quantization so recipient do n't have to this be also the   disadvantage   of GIF you 're stick with the sender 's quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re quantize result in much poor image quality than if you have quantize once from a full color image furthermore if the sender did n't use a high quality color quantization algorithm you 're out of luck for this reason JPEG offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine do n't match the sender 's display hardware JPEG 's full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user 's display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of jpeg image you already have with a GIF you 're stick forevermore with what be send It 's also worth mention that many GIF view program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a 256 color GIF on a 16 color EGA display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to this be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the GIF one to display it but often it be also due to sloppiness JPEG conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizer in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be display thus JPEG be likely to provide well result than the average GIF program for low color resolution display as well as high resolution one finally an ever grow number of people have well than-8 bit display hardware already 15 bit hi color pc display true 24 bit display on workstation and macintosh etc for these people GIF be already obsolete as it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thus JPEG be an all around well choice than GIF for represent image in a machine independent fashion   8   how do jpeg work the buzz word to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transform coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article 's long enough already so i 'm not go to say more than that here for technical information see the comp.compression FAQ this be available from the news.answer archive at rtfm.mit.edu in file pub   usenet   news.answer   compression faq   part1 3   if you need help in use the news.answer archive see the top of this article   9   what about lossless jpeg There be a great deal of confusion on this subject the JPEG committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantee the final output be bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offer much less compression at present very few implementation of lossless JPEG exist and all of they be commercial say -q 100 to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossless image what it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsample step with the v4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsample keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular JPEG algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value- it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit for bit accuracy if you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than 6 bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard this perform well than jpeg lossless on such image JPEG lossless be superior to JBIG on image with 6 or more bit per pixel- furthermore JPEG be public domain at least with a Huffman back end while the JBIG technique be heavily cover by patent   10   why all the argument about file format strictly speak JPEG refer only to a family of compression algorithms- it do   not   refer to a specific image file format the JPEG committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we ca n't actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leave we with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to do their own thing and as a result their program are n't compatible with anybody else 's the close thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format be some work that be be coordinate by people at C Cube Microsystems they have define two jpeg base file format   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a low end format that transport pixel and not much else   tiff   JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format TIFF be a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides TIFF be a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of TIFF It 's not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these format be develop with input from all the major vendor of jpeg relate products- it 's reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture posting JFIF be simple than TIFF and be available now- the TIFF 6.0 spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when TIFF   JPEG be well define the JFIF format be likely to be a widely support low common denominator- tiff   jpeg file may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in be Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh QuickTime use a JFIF compatible format wrap inside the Mac specific pict structure conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG be pretty straightforward and several Mac program be available to do it see Mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a QuickTime jpeg PICT down to JFIF by hand- see section 11 for detail another particular case be Handmade Software 's program GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy these program be capable of read and write JFIF format by default though they write a proprietary format develop by HSI this format be not readable by any non hsi program and should not be use for Usenet posting use the -j switch to get JFIF output this apply to old version of these programs- the current release emit JFIF format by default you still should be careful not to post HSI format file unless you want to get flame by people on non pc platform   11   how do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wo n't read it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary jpeg base format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file 1 a JFIF standard file will start with the character hex FF d8 FF E0 follow by two variable byte often hex 00 10 follow by jfif 2 if you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this be probably decodable as be by JFIF software it 's worth a try anyway 3 HSI file start with hsi1 You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg datum but they wo n't decompress properly with non hsi program 4 a Macintosh pict file if jpeg compress will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a JFIF header scan for JFIF strip off everything before the FF d8 and you should be able to read it 5 anything else it 's a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG datum stream if you can identify the start of the JPEG datum stream look for FF D8 try strip off everything before that in uuencoded Usenet posting the characteristic JFIF pattern be tbegin line tmcx whereas uuencoded HSI file will start with tbegin line tm:'-i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non jfif file   12   what about arithmetic coding the JPEG spec define two different back end module for the final output of compress datum either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding be allow the choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produce a small compressed file on typical image arithmetic coding produce a file 5 or 10 percent small than Huffman code all the file size number previously cite be for Huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specify by the JPEG standard be subject to patent own by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi thus   you can not legally use arithmetic coding   unless you obtain license from these company the fair use doctrine allow people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at well at least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding- the space saving is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic coding   should not   be use for any image to be exchange on Usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for further detail   13   do loss accumulate with repeat compression   decompression it would be nice if having compress an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately this be not the case in general recompresse an altered image lose more information though usually not as much as be lose the first time around the next good thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it   without change it   then there be no further loss i.e. you get an identical jpeg file even this be not true- at least not with the current free JPEG software It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on our to do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limit but I be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guarantee would be that compress the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple change as crop off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you 're wonder why it 's because the pixel block boundary move if you crop off only multiple of 16 pixel you might be safe but that be a mighty limited capability the bottom line be that JPEG be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossless format PPM RLE TIFF etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression   decompression time this way   14   what be some rule of thumb for convert GIF image to jpeg as state early you   will   lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist GIF image to JPEG if you can obtain the original full color datum the GIF be make from it 's far well to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality the first rule when convert a GIF library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif- that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary some gif may be well leave as GIFs as explain in section 3- in particular cartoon type GIFs with sixteen or few color do n't convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be   large   than the GIF so check the size too experience to date suggest that large high visual quality gif be the good candidate for conversion to JPEG they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to JPEG with least degradation do n't waste your time convert any GIF much under 100 Kbytes also do n't expect jpeg file convert from GIFs to be as small as those create directly from full color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg file would be i.e. shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the GIF file not 14th as suggest in early comparison many people have develop an odd habit of put a large constant color border around a GIF image while useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in GIF file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact ghost edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpege if you be on an x Windows system XV 's manual and automatic cropping function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default q setting of 75 be appropriate for full color input but for GIF input q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggest below the high Q setting may not be necessary Color gif of photograph or complex artwork be usually dither to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that GIF can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different colors- at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to JPEG it look like high spatial frequency color noise- and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have get from jpege the original full color image if you have it to get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression smooth average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you think you see anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color change that give JPEG trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid use a high q factor thus far reduce the size of the compressed file while still obtain a well look output image than you 'd get without smooth with the v4 free JPEG software or product base on it a simple smoothing capability be build in try -smooth 10 or so when convert gif value of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gif heavy handed dithering may require large smoothing factor if you can see regular fine scale pattern on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing be definitely call for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you do n't want if you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package however cjpeg 's build in smoother be a LOT fast than pnmconvol the upshot of all this be that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 be probably a good starting point for convert GIFs but if you really care about the image you 'll want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting for more information about JPEG in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-infouunet.uu.net;1

disseminate by each service Selection personal interview and thorough medical evaluation will be require for both civilian and military applicant under final consideration once final selection have be make all applicant who be consider will be notify of the outcome of the process selection roster establish through this process may be use for the selection of additional candidate during a one year period follow their establishment General Program Requirements select applicant will be designate Astronaut Candidates and will be assign to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center Houston Texas the astronaut candidate will undergo a 1 year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assign technical or scientific responsibility allow they to contribute substantially to ongoing program they will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which be design to develop the knowledge and skill require for formal mission training upon selection for a flight pilot astronaut candidate will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during their candidate period Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate do not insure selection as an astronaut final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and evaluation period civilian candidate who successfully complete the training and evaluation and be select as astronaut will become permanent Federal employee and will be expect to remain with NASA for a period of at least five year civilian candidate who be not select as astronaut may be

1883;archive name atheism   introduction alt atheism archive name introduction last modify 5 April 1993 version 1.2 -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED message----- an introduction to atheism by mathew   mathewmantis.co.uk   this article attempt to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst I have try to be as neutral as possible regard contentious issue you should always remember that this document represent only one viewpoint I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions- some relevant book be list in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression I have present this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the question ask by the imaginary theist be question which have be crop up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup be create some other frequently ask question be answer in a companion article please note that this article be arguably slant towards answer question pose from a christian viewpoint this be because the FAQ file reflect question which have actually be ask and it be predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism so when I talk of religion I be talk primarily about religion such as Christianity Judaism and Islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine be much of the discussion will apply to other religion but some of it may not what be atheism atheism be characterize by an absence of belief in the existence of God some atheist go far and believe that God do not exist the former be often refer to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism it be important to note the difference between these two position weak atheism be simple scepticism- disbelief in the existence of God strong atheism be a positive belief that God do not exist please do not fall into the trap of assume that all atheist be strong atheist some atheist believe in the non existence of all Gods- other limit their atheism to specific Gods such as the Christian God rather than make flat out denial but is n't disbelieve in God the same thing as believe he does n't exist definitely not Disbelief in a proposition mean that one do not believe it to be true not believe that something be true be not equivalent to believe that it be false- one may simply have no idea whether it be true or not which bring we to agnosticism what be agnosticism then the term agnosticism be coin by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 he define an agnostic as someone who disclaim strong atheism and believe that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic be someone who believe that we do not and can not know for sure whether God exist word be slippery thing and language be inexact beware of assume that you can work out someone 's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when refer to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist have so many shade of meaning it be very difficult to generalize about atheist about all you can say for sure be that atheist do n't believe in God for example it certainly is n't the case that all atheist believe that science be the good way to find out about the universe so what be the philosophical justification or basis for atheism there be many philosophical justification for atheism to find out why a particular person choose to be an atheist it 's good to ask she many atheist feel that the idea of God as present by the major religion be essentially self contradictory and that it be logically impossible that such a God could exist other be atheist through scepticism because they see no evidence that God exist but is n't it impossible to prove the non existence of something there be many counter example to such a statement for example it be quite simple to prove that there do not exist a prime number large than all other prime number of course this deal with well define object obey well define rule whether Gods or universe be similarly well define be a matter for debate however assume for the moment that the existence of a God be not provably impossible there be still subtle reason for assume the non existence of God if we assume that something do not exist it be always possible to show that this assumption be invalid by find a single counter example if on the other hand we assume that something do exist and if the thing in question be not provably impossible show that the assumption be invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a thing might be find to show that it is n't there such an exhaustive search be often impractical or impossible there be no such problem with large prime because we can prove that they do n't exist therefore it be generally accept that we must assume thing do not exist unless we have evidence that they do even theist follow this rule most of the time- they do n't believe in unicorn even though they ca n't conclusively prove that no unicorn exist anywhere to assume that God exist be to make an assumption which probably can not be test we can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he does n't exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assume by default that God do not exist since that be an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists- instead they generally restrict their claim so as to cover variety of God describe by follower of various religion so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exist it may be possible to prove that say a God as describe by a particular religious book do not exist it may even be possible to prove that no God describe by any present day religion exist in practice believe that no God describe by any religion exist be very close to believe that no God exist however it be sufficiently different that counter argument base on the impossibility of disprove every kind of God be not really applicable but what if God be essentially non detectable if God interact with our universe in any way the effect of his interaction must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable if God be essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he do not interact with our universe in any way many atheist would argue that if God do not interact with our universe at all it be of no importance whether he exist or not if the Bible be to be believe God be easily detectable by the Israelites surely he should still be detectable today note that I be not demand that God interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect cause by his presence though- otherwise how can I distinguish he from all the other thing that do n't exist ok you may think there 's a philosophical justification for atheism but is n't it still a religious belief one of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion be the redefinition game the cynical view of this game be as follow Person A begin by make a contentious statement when person b point out that it ca n't be true person a gradually re define the word he use in the statement until he arrive at something person b be prepared to accept he then record the statement along with the fact that person b have agree to it and continue eventually a use the statement as an agree fact but use his original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally need to get b to agree to it rather than be see to be apparently inconsistent B will tend to play along the point of this digression be that the answer to the question is n't atheism a religious belief depend crucially upon what be mean by religious Religion be generally characterize by belief in a superhuman control power especially in some sort of God and by faith and worship   It 's worth point out in pass that some variety of Buddhism be not religion accord to such a definition   atheism be certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor be it categorize by worship in any meaningful sense widen the definition of religious to encompass atheism tend to result in many other aspect of human behaviour suddenly become class as religious as well such as science politic and watch tv ok so it be not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science be still just an act of faith like religion be firstly it be not entirely clear that sceptical atheism be something one actually believe in secondly it be necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory datum we experience Most atheist try to adopt as few core belief as possible- and even those be subject to question if experience throw they into doubt Science have a number of core assumption for example it be generally assume that the law of physic be the same for all observer these be the sort of core assumption atheist make if such basic idea be call act of faith then almost everything we know must be say to be base on act of faith and the term lose its meaning Faith be more often use to refer to complete certain belief in something accord to such a definition atheism and science be certainly not act of faith of course individual atheist or scientist can be as dogmatic as religious follower when claim that something be certain this be not a general tendency however- there be many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exist Faith be also use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly does n't fit that definition as sceptical atheism have no belief strong atheism be close but still does n't really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental datum or the lack of it when assert that God do not exist if atheism be not religious surely it 's anti religious it be an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy the truth be not so clear cut atheism be the position that run logically counter to theism- in that sense it can be say to be anti religion however when religious believer speak of atheist be anti religious they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theist this categorization of atheist as hostile towards religion be quite unfair atheist attitude towards theist in fact cover a broad spectrum Most atheist take a live and let live attitude unless question they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friend of course this may be in part because atheism be not socially acceptable in many country a few atheist be quite anti religious and may even try to convert other when possible historically such anti religious atheist have make little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc country to digress slightly the Soviet Union be originally dedicate to separation of church and state just like the USA soviet citizen be legally free to worship as they wish the institution of state atheism come about when Stalin take control of the Soviet Union and try to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the population some atheist be quite vocal about their belief but only where they see religion encroach on matter which be not its business for example the government of the USA such individual be usually concerned that church and state should remain separate but if you do n't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely that be the same as state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state be that the state shall not legislate concern matter of religious belief in particular it mean not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it can not promote any belief which be religious in nature religion can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matter for example religious believer have historically be responsible for encourage many political reform even today many organization campaign for an increase in spending on foreign aid be found as religious campaign so long as they campaign concern secular matter and so long as they do not discriminate on religious ground most atheist be quite happy to see they have their say what about prayer in school if there 's no God why do you care if people pray because people who do pray be voter and lawmaker and tend to do thing that those who do n't pray ca n't just ignore also christian prayer in school be intimidate to non Christians even if they be tell that they need not join in the diversity of religious and non religious belief mean that it be impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non prayer tend to have friend and family who pray it be reasonable to care about friend and family waste their time even without other motive you mention Christians who campaign for increase foreign aid what about atheist why are n't there any atheist charity or hospital Do n't atheist object to the religious charity there be many charity without religious purpose that atheist can contribute to some atheist contribute to religious charity as well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheist even do voluntary work for charity found on a theistic basis Most atheist seem to feel that atheism is n't worth shout about in connection with charity to they atheism be just a simple obvious everyday matter and so be charity many feel that it 's somewhat cheap not to say self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious belief to weak atheist build a hospital to say I do not believe in God be a rather strange idea- it 's rather like hold a party to say today be not my birthday why the fuss atheism be rarely evangelical you say atheism is n't anti religious but be it perhaps a backlash against one 's upbringing a way of rebel perhaps it be for some but many people have parent who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist idea upon they and many of those people choose to call themselves atheist It 's also doubtless the case that some religious people choose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of be different on the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conform to the expectation of other on the whole we ca n't conclude much about whether atheism or religion be backlash or conformism- although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently how do atheist differ from religious people they do n't believe in God That be all there be to it atheist may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem even if they know the word they may wear hawaiian shirt they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robe many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God some atheist even carry a copy of the Bible around for argue against of course whoever you be the chance be you have meet several atheist without realise it atheist be usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance Unexceptional but are n't atheist less moral than religious people that depend if you define morality as obedience to God then of course atheist be less moral as they do n't obey any God but usually when one talk of morality one talk of what be acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society human be social animal and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other this be a good enough reason to discourage most atheist from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purpose of self preservation many atheist behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other human so why do they care what happen to other they do n't know they simply be that way naturally there be some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their action however there be equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious belief to justify their action for example here be a trustworthy saying that deserve full acceptance Jesus Christ come into the world to save sinner but for that very reason I be show mercy so that in I Jesus Christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in he and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only God be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote be from a statement make to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee Wisconsin it seem that for every atheist mass murderer there be a religious mass murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conduct by the Roper Organization find that behavior deteriorate after bear again experience while only 4 of respondent say they have drive intoxicate before be bear again 12 have do so after conversion similarly 5 have use illegal drug before conversion 9 after two percent admit to engage in illicit sex before salvation- 5 after   Freethought Today September 1991 p. 12   so it seem that at good religion do not have a monopoly on moral behaviour be there such a thing as atheist morality if you mean be there such a thing as morality for atheist then the answer be yes as explain above many atheist have idea about morality which be at least as strong as those hold by religious people if you mean do atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer be no atheism by itself do not imply anything much about how a person will behave Most atheist follow many of the same moral rule as theist but for different reason atheist view morality as something create by human accord to the way human feel the world ought to work rather than see it as a set of rule decree by a supernatural being then are n't atheist just theist who be deny God a study by the Freedom from Religion Foundation find that over 90 of the atheist who respond become atheist because religion do not work for they they have find that religious belief be fundamentally incompatible with what they observe around they atheist be not unbeliever through ignorance or denial- they be unbeliever through choice the vast majority of they have spend time study one or more religion sometimes in very great depth they have make a careful and consider decision to reject religious belief this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual 's personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism be often the only one that make sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make but do n't atheist want to believe in God atheist live their life as though there be nobody watch over they many of they have no desire to be watch over no matter how good natured the Big Brother figure might be some atheist would like to be able to believe in God but so what should one believe thing merely because one want they to be true the risk of such an approach should be obvious atheist often decide that want to believe something be not enough- there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of God they be unwilling in their soul to see many if not most atheist be previously religious as have be explain above the vast majority have seriously consider the possibility that God exist many atheist have spend time in prayer try to reach God of course it be true that some atheist lack an open mind- but assume that all atheist be biased and insincere be offensive and closed minded comment such as of course God be there you just are n't look properly be likely to be view as patronize certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it be vital that you give they the benefit of the doubt and assume that they be be sincere if they say that they have search for God if you be not willing to believe that they be basically tell the truth debate be futile Is n't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist many atheist live a purposeful life they decide what they think give meaning to life and they pursue those goal they try to make their life count not by wish for eternal life but by have an influence on other people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leave his mark on history it be a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random event however it be by no mean obvious that life be the sort of thing that have a meaning to put it another way not everything which look like a question be actually a sensible thing to ask some atheist believe that ask what be the meaning of life be as silly as ask what be the meaning of a cup of coffee they believe that life have no purpose or meaning it just be so how do atheist find comfort in time of danger there be many way of obtain comfort- from family friend or even pet or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individual believe in thing because they be comfort or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it 's a decision for the individual concern Most atheist be unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make they feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if search for truth sometimes make they feel unhappy that be just hard luck do n't atheist worry that they might suddenly be show to be wrong the short answer be no do you many atheist have be atheist for year they have encounter many argument and much suppose evidence for the existence of God but they have find all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousand of year of religious belief have n't result in any good proof of the existence of God atheist therefore tend to feel that they be unlikely to be prove wrong in the immediate future and they stop worry about it so why should theist question their belief do n't the same argument apply no because the belief be question be not similar weak atheism be the sceptical default position to take- it assert nothing strong atheism be a negative belief Theism be a very strong positive belief Atheists sometimes also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believer but to everyone else what sort of harm Religion represent a huge financial and work burden on mankind It be not just a matter of religious believer waste their money on church buildings- think of all the time and effort spend building church pray and so on imagine how that effort could be well spend many theist believe in miracle healing there have be plenty of instance of ill people be heal by a priest cease to take the medicine prescribe to they by doctor and die as a result some theist have die because they have refuse blood transfusion on religious ground it be arguable that the Catholic Church 's opposition to birth control and condom in particular be increase the problem of overpopulation in many third world country and contribute to the spread of AIDS world wide religious believer have be know to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of a different religion those were n't real believer they just claim to be believer as some sort of excuse what make a real believer there be so many one True Religions it 's hard to tell look at christianity there be many compete group all convince that they be the only true Christians sometimes they even fight and kill each other how be an atheist suppose to decide who 's a real Christian and who is n't when even the major christian church like the Catholic Church and the Church of England ca n't decide amongst themselves in the end most atheist take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who call himself a Christian and use christian belief or dogma to justify his action should be consider a Christian maybe some of those Christians be just pervert Christian teaching for their own end but surely if the Bible can be so readily use to support un christian act it ca n't be much of a moral code if the Bible be the word of God why could n't he have make it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your belief are n't a perversion of what your God intend if there be no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so sorry but if someone claim that he believe in Jesus and that he murder other because Jesus and the Bible tell he to do so we must call he a Christian obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question but since nobody have ever prove that God do not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious belief share by all faith be nonsense that do not hold because as be point out at the start of this dialogue positive assertion concern the existence of entity be inherently much hard to disprove than negative one nobody have ever prove that unicorn do n't exist but that does n't make it unlikely that they be myth it be therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it be to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheist would argue that assert nothing be well still well if atheism be so great why be there so many theist unfortunately the popularity of a belief have little to do with how correct it be or whether it works- consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo sciences many atheist feel that it be simply a human weakness to want to believe in god certainly in many primitive human society religion allow the people to deal with phenomenon that they do not adequately understand of course there 's more to religion than that in the industrialized world we find people believe in religious explanation of phenomenon even when there be perfectly adequate natural explanation Religion may have start as a means of attempt to explain the world but nowadays it serve other purpose as well but so many culture have develop religion surely that must say something not really Most religion be only superficially similar- for example it 's worth remember that religion such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the christian sense of course most religion be quick to denounce compete religion so it 's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famous scientist and philosopher who have conclude that God exist for every scientist or philosopher who believe in a god there be one who do not besides as have already be point out the truth of a belief be not determine by how many people believe it also it be important to realize that atheist do not view famous scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religious leader a famous scientist be only human- she may be an expert in some field but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight many respected scientist have make themselves look foolish by speak on subject which lie outside their field of expertise so be you really say that widespread belief in religion indicate nothing not entirely it certainly indicate that the religion in question have property which have help it so spread so far the theory of memetic talk of meme set of idea which can propagate themselves between human mind by analogy with gene some atheist view religion as set of particularly successful parasitic meme which spread by encourage their host to convert other some meme avoid destruction by discourage believer from question doctrine or by use peer pressure to keep one time believer from admit that they be mistaken some religious meme even encourage their host to destroy host control by other meme of course in the memetic view there be no particular virtue associate with successful propagation of a meme Religion be not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease be a good thing because of the number of people who have catch it even if religion be not entirely true at least it put across important message what be the fundamental message of atheism there be many important idea atheist promote the follow be just a few of them- do n't be surprised to see idea which be also present in some religion there be more to moral behaviour than mindlessly follow rule be especially sceptical of positive claim if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it be up to you to find it search for what be true even if it make you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it 's probably the only one you 'll have It 's no good rely on some external power to change you- you must change yourself just because something 's popular does n't mean it 's good if you must assume something assume something it 's easy to test do n't believe thing just because you want they to be true and finally and most importantly all belief should be open to question thank for take the time to read this article mathew -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version 2.2

1916;I think that you be change the meaning of value here perhaps it be time to backtrack and take a look at the word value n. 1 a fair equivalent or return for something such as good or service 2 monetary or material worth 3 worth as measure in usefulness or importance- merit 4 a principle standard or quality consider inherently worthwhile or desirable 5 precise meaning as of a word 6 an assigned or calculated numerical quantity 7 Mus the relative duratation of a tone or rest 8 the relative darkness or lightness of a color 9 the distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound in context of a moral system definition four seem to fit well in term of scientific usage definition six or eight might apply note that these definition do not mean the same thing in my mind to say that science have its basis in value be a bit of a reach science have its basis in observable fact even the usage of the word value above do not denote observable fact but rather a standard of measurement I would conclude that science do not have its basis in value and so your statement above fail in fact if one conclude that a scientific set of measurement value be base on system derive from observation then it must follow that in a scientific context there be no such thing as there be no such thing as objective value back to the present this have nothing to do with a moral system anyhow just because the word value be use in both context do not mean that there be a relationship between the two contexts if one be to argue for objective value in a moral sense then one must first start by demonstrate that morality itself be objective consider the meaning of the word objective I doubt that this will ever happen so back to the original question and objective morality be if you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will be a good beginning;3

1924;Yep that be pretty much it I 'm not a Jew but I understand that this be the jewish way of thinking however the Jews believe that the Covenant between YHWH and the Patriarchs Abraham and Moses in this case establish a Moral Code to follow for mankind even the Jews could not decide where the boundary fall though as I understand it the Sadducees believe that the Torah be all that be require whereas the Pharisees the ancestor of modern Judaism believe that the Torah be available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of the require Morality in all its nuance -Talmud the essence of all of this be that Biblical Morality be an interface between Man and yhwh for a Jew or Christian and do not necessarily indicate anything about YHWH outside of that relationship although one can speculate the trouble with all of this be that we do n't really know what the create in his image mean I 've hear a number of different opinion on this and have still not come to any conclusion this rather upset the Apple Cart if one want to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphor unashamedly as to live by Christ 's example we know very little about Jesus as a person we only have his record utterance in a set of narrative by his follower and some very small reference from comtemporary historian Revelation aside one can only know Christ second hand or bad this be not an attempt to debunk Christianity although it may seem that way initially the point i m try to make be that we only really have the Bible to interpret and that interpretation be by humanity I guess this be where Faith or relevation come in with all its inherent subjectiveness no there may be an absolute moral code there be undoubtably multiple moral code the multiple moral code may be found in the absolute moral code as an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child may assume that the parent never swear simply because the parent have tell the child that it be wrong now the parent may swear like a trooper in the pub or bar where there be no child the wrongness here be if the child disobey the parent the parent may feel that it be inappropriate to swear in front of child but may be quite happy to swear in front of animal the analogy do not quite hold water because the child know that he be of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but you get the gist of it incidentally the young child consider the directive as absolute until he get old see Piaget and learn a morality of his own David on religion;3

1943;read from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet their erl-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement have a compressive strength of 280,000 psi it have a density of 0.058 lb   cu in therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself be 4.8 million inch or 400,000 ft or 75 Statute mile now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss type or guy wire or both and will be use below the crush strength let we assume that we will operate at 40 of the theoretical strength this give a work height of 30 mile for a constant section column a constant section column be not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up for example let we say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in calculation this require 2.5 square inch of column cross sectional area to support the weight the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb so at 1 mile below the payload the total load be now 289,200 lb a 3.3 increase the next mile of structure must be 3.3 thick in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom we can see from this that there be no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limit base on how much composite we can afford to by at   40   lb and how much load you need to support on the ground for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support let we arbitrarily choose   1 billion as the limit in costruction cost with this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composite assume our finished structure cost   100   lb the   40   lb figure be just for material cost then we have a tower   payload mass ratio of 35.7:1 at a 3.3 mass ratio per mile the tower height become 111 mile this be clearly above the significant atmosphere a rocket launch from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and g loss will be almost eliminate g loss be the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity thus they represent waste thrust together with drag rocket start from the ground have a 15 velocity penalty to contend with this analysis be simplify in that it do not consider wind load these will require more structural support over the first 15 mile of height above that the air pressure drop to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor Dani Eder;2

1972;reference line trim well I 'd say that a murderer be one who intentionally commit a murder for instance if you put a bullet into a gun that be think to contain blank and someone be kill with such a gun the person who actually perform the action is n't the murderer but I guess this be actually make clear in the below definition what do you mean by reasonable     yes it be bad to include the word be define in the definition but even though the series be recursively infinite I think the meaning can still be deduce   math lesson delete   okay let 's look at this situation suppose there be a longstanding feud between two family which claim that the other commit some travesty in the distant past each time a member of the one family kill a member of the other the other family think that it be justify in kill a that member of the first family now let 's suppose that this sequence have occur an infinite number of time or if you do n't like deal with infinity suppose that one member of the family go back into time and essentially begin the whole thing that is there be a never end loop of slaying base on some non existent travesty how do you resolve this well they be all murder now I suppose that this is n't totally applicable to your problem but it still be possible to reduce an uninduced system and in any case the nest murderer in the definition of murder can not be infintely recursive give the finite existence of humanity and a murder can not be commit without a killing involve so the first person to intentionally cause someone to get kill be necessarily a murderer be this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition see in a totally objective system where all the information be available such a nested definition is n't really a problem;0

1990;  Rick Anderson reply to my letter with    ra   in article   C5ELp2.L0Cacsu.buffalo.edu     ra     just briefly on something that you mention in pass you refer to   differ interpretation of create and say that many Christians may   not agree so what that be really irrelevant we do not base our faith   on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line be   truth regardless of popularity of opinion it may be irrelevant to you and   your   personal belief or should I say bias but it be relevant to I and many other You 're right the bottom line be truth independant from you or anyone else since you proclaim truth as a self proclaim appointee may I ask you by what authority you do this because it say so in the Bible --doe the Bible say so or be it you or someone else who interpret whether a scripture or doctrine conform to your particular liking or disapproval Excuse moi but your line of truth have n't move I one bit to persuade I that my belief be erroneous of all the preacher of truth on this net you have strike I as a self righteous member of the wreck crew with no positive message to I or any other latter day Saint BTW this entire discussion remind I a lot of the thing say by Jesus to the pharisees ye hypocrite(s ye preach about I with your lip but your heart be far removed from I   also I find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create   and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the Mormon   belief you ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to   have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to address   and answer the point that be raise and not just jump to the   conclusion that you grant Sophistry look who 's talking jump to conclusion you would n't do that yourself right all you address be your own conviction regardless whether we come up with any biblical scripture which support our point of view because you reject such interpretation without any consideration whatsoever    the Bible state that Lucifer be create the Bible state that Jesus   be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the LDS   belief be that Jesus and Lucifer be the same a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine the former KGB would have love to employ you Jesus and lucifer be not the same silly and you know it   the Mormon belief be that all be child of God literally there be   nothing symbolic about it this however contradict what the Bible   say the Bible teach that not everyone be a child of God Correction it may contradict would you think the Bible say the Bible indeed do teach that not all be child of God in the sense that they belong to or follow God in his footstep Satan and his follower have rebel against God and be not child follower   redeem of God but it does n't mean that they be not once create by God but choose to separate themselves from those who choose to follow God and his plan of salvation    the field be the world- the good seed be the child of the   kingdom- but the tare be the child of the wicked one-   Matthew 13:38 kingdom be those who have remain valiant in their testimony of Jesus and have show work of repentance etc and the child of the wicked one be those who rebel against God and the lamb the issue of satan 's spirit origin and of those who follow he have not be address in this and other verse you copy from your Bible you purposefully obscure the subject by swamp your right with non- relate scripture lot of nice scripture delete not Robert W. copyright though   ra    we be tell that and this be life eternal that they might know   ra    thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast send   ra    John 17:3 life eternal be to know the only true God yet the   ra    doctrine of the lds that I have mention portray a vastly   ra    different Jesus a Jesus that can not be reconcile with the Jesus of   ra    the Bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim Correction my Jesus be indeed different than your Jesus and can be reconcile with the Jesus in the Bible --not your interpretation of Him I concur but I honestly could n't care less   ra    one as be true deny the other from be true accord to the   ra    Bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true God and   ra    not the construct of imagination in this single posting of your i 've see more construct of imagination than in all of the pro lds mail combine I have read so far in this news group first get your lds fact straight before you dare preach to we about the only true God whom you interpret accord to your own like and dislike but whose image I can not reconcile with what I know about he myself I guess your grandiose self image do not allow for other faith believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ but in a different way or fashion than your own not that it really matter the mission and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progress until it have visit every continent sweep every clime and sound in every ear   this be really a red herring it does n't address any issue raise but   rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read   something into the Bible does n't change what the Bible teach Sigh what the Bible teach or what the bible teach accord to Robert Weiss and co. I respect the former I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have reject Jesus on the contrary and by the way I do respect your interpretation of the Bible I even grant you be a Christian follow your own image of Him as much as I be a Christian follow my own image of he in my heart   Most of the other reply have instead hop scotch to the issue of   Bruce McConkie and whether his view be official doctrine I do n't   think that it matter if McConkie 's view be canon that be not the   issue be McConkie 's writing indicative of Mormon belief on this   subject be the real issue the indication from Rick be that they may   certainly be the issue be of course that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church the issue of official doctrine be obviously very important McConkie 's view have be controversial e.g. the Seven Deadly Heresies have make I a heretic at good or erroneous at bad black not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation I respect he as someone who have make his valuable contribution to the church but I personally do not rely on his personal interpretation his book Mormon Doctrine be oftentime refer to as McConkie 's Bible in mormon circle on mormon doctrine I rather look to official doctrinal source and to Hugh Nibley 's book the last comment be an lds insider reference Summarizing McConkie be a wise man who contribute undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have but whose view be by no means dogma or accept doctrine some of it clearly belong to personal interpretation and speculation but having say this I find McConkie even in his most biased and speculative moment far more thought provoking than the trash come from your proverbial pen I 'm somewhat appalled that I have allow myself to sink as low as you in this posting                               Robert Weiss psyrobtwubvms.cc.buffalo.edu;3

1993;but you have n't take into the account of propoganda remember if you ask Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughter they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine roll through at least some be able to tolerate it you see it only take a small group of fanatic to whip up a general frenzy well they have n't manage to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the court but they have manage to create quite a few problem for people that want to have an abortion they could create similar problem for we and it could be bad they can try to stop abortion by block clinic etc but imagine what they 'd have to do to stop atheism so you be able to convince they individually but could you convince a whole room of they a whole nation yes i 'd be glad if it be go to i 've never support it however I think that it be a minor problem that can be easily ignore contrast with what   could   happen an what may be likely well I be not clear on the religious conviction of Francis Scott Key the motto can be attribute to he but it be at least clear that he believe in a god and surely there be a few Christians that think as you say but I do n't think that most do do you think that all Christians actively despise other religion Most that I have meet have n't and do n't do so well I have ask a Hindu Moselem and a few Jews and all of they think that it be applicable to they of course I ca n't say that these people just some that I know pretty well be accurate representation of their faith well i 'd really like to and I 've try but I really do n't know where to get access to   Congressional Records   from the 1950 's can anyone help out here only in the sense that neither can probably convince to change their belief so be you say that they redesign the plate each year anyway your whole argument conveniently delete I see be that the motto somehow cost we all a lot of money this be just not correct that be to say the religion of this country and the non religion of the USSR that be what most of those quote be about and some include all atheist in general as well I do n't think that any of the quote although I seem to have lose they mention anything at all about Jesus they advocate religion over non religion a specific religion be not mention so you be say that all Christians must believe that all other religion should be outlaw just because they think they be wrong That 's silly I think the flat earther be wrong but I do n't advocate their banishment I think that any such cost would be insignificant I mention the slight cost because you say that the motto be cost we a lot of money by be on our currency well motto in general do n't really have purpose I do n't think it should be remove because I think the benefit would be outweigh by the consequence then you should be concern with the opinion of the entire congress why not it be the majority that put it there but do they remember the debate surround the motto do they remember that some people intend it to be a message against atheist why do n't you include this in your little survey that you be conduct     what should I ask some scientist the probability that something Einstein say about relativity be worthy I mean if Einstein say it there 's a good chance that it be right at least at the time you need not agree with they all of the time but you would certainly think that their decision would be good evidence in favor of some point no I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to testify before Congress during the consideration of a Constitutional Amendment and in order for the Court to rule on something a case usually must be present yes some mushroom can be plant and I do n't appreciate mushroom on my pizza either who be force to put the motto there what do you mean;0
1994;it amaze I that you have the audacity to say that human creation be not the result of the natural process of evolution but rather an act of God and then in the same post say that these other process volcanos et al be natural occurrence who give you the right to choose what thing be natural process and what be direct act of God how do you know that God does n't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose in mind it would certainly go along with the sadistic nature i 've see in the bible Adam   Eve two PEOPLE even tho they have the honor or so you christian claim of be the first two definitely do not represent a majority in the billion and trillion probably more of people that have come after they perhaps they be the majority then but   I   and YOU were n't around to vote and perhaps we might have vote differently about what to do with that tree but your god never ask we he just assume that if you have two bad people then they all must be bad Hmm sound like the same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theist post here resort to so THAT be where they get it shoulda know Nanci;0

2002;what evidence indicate that Gamma Ray burster be very far away their distribution be very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speak indicate we 're see an edge to the distribution give the enormous power I be just wonder what if they be quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic range now in the good old day before GRO datum it be think the gamma burster be neutron star in the galaxy it be expect that GRO would confirm this by either show they be a local population within a few hundred light year or that they be in the galactic halo mechanism be not know but several plausible one exist also to be fair it be note that the   bright   burster be probably in the LMC suggest theorist might be wrong back then tas the Sun be not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population be rule out completely at this stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then get large the mechanism of get NS out that far become questionable and we should start to see for example the Andromeda 's burster tthe datum be consistent with either a oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum or it can be a cosmological distance hence isotropy and the edge be the edge of the Universe if at cosmological distance you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star collide with another neutron star or black hole even then get the spectrum be very hard but conceivable tif we know anything about physics at that level the burster be not due to quantum black hole or cosmic string wrong spectrum for one thing the situation be far complicate by recent claim that there be two class of source   in the collide NS they 'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS NS and NS BH collision scenario respectively   my own pet theory be that it 's Flying saucer enter hyperspace but the reason I be ask be that most everyone assume that they be collide nuetron star or spin black hole I just wonder if any mechanism could exist and place they close in if you can think of one remember to invite I to Stockholm;2

2010;Speech by Pete Worden deliver before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference Colorado Springs Colorado April 15 1993 what a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble for provide I this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation my topic today be the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT by I intend to speak of more how to lower the cost and make rapid progress SSRT be to my mind and I hope to convince you the erupt a new rallying cry for our generation in space fast Cheaper and Better fast Cheaper Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another it be a new thing to be sure but it be also a relearning of old thing from past master when we roll out the ssrt baby two week ago so call expert tell we it violate the law of physics it make no sense for example Dr. Eberhart Rachtin former president of the Aerospace Corp. say of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it defy the good principle of launch payload into space well Dr. Rachtin you 've make we mad what be these principle that SSRT defy well I 'll tell you it violate the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware it violate the fact that it take 20 year to build something new and it violate the truism that you can not do anything significant for less than many billion of dollar it take some of the last generation 's expert to teach we some new   old lesson Werhner Von Braun 's first rocket be not a Saturn V. General Schriever 's icbm 's did n't take ten year to demonstrate and the x-1 airplane did n't cost   1 billion it take one of the great engineer of the 1950 's to remind we of these truth Max Hunter Max to remind you be a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program and old fast well cheap success story Max have be persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960 's because he know it have to be do in affordable step build a little test a little next he persuade we to do a technology demonstration we did n't solicit a bunch of requirement they 'd just change every few year anyway   not include in the speech the ALS   NLS have such ephemeral requirement that it would well know as Shape Shifter than Space Lifter we did n't spend a lot money this x rocket only cost   60 million When 's the last time we even build a new airplane for that and it did n't take a lot of time to build McDonnell Douglas complete it in 18 month finally the government program office consist of one very over work Air Force Major motivate in part by the threat that he 'd get to ride on it in a strap on lawn chair if it run over cost or schedule as I describe what SSRT be and is n't keep in mind its only a first step there be several more step and step that can easily fail before the U.S. can field an ssto but each step should follow the same principle a small management team a few year technology demonstration and a modest budget let I show a few detail on SSRT and how it might evolve see chart I 'm embarrass when my generation be compare with the last generation the giant of the last great space era the 1950 's and 1960 's they go to the moon we build a telescope that ca n't see straight they soft land on Mars the least we could do be soft land on Earth but we do have an answer we can follow their build a little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space I know there be nay sayer among you those who say SSRT be a stunt it need more thermal protection the engine be wrong it would be well to land horizontally etc etc I say to you we 'll see you at White Sands in June you bring your view graph and I 'll bring my rocketship if we do what we say we can do then you let we do the next step   not include in the speech if we fail you still have your program office staff summary sheet requirement analysis and decade long program  ;2
2011;ZOROASTRIANISM SAN JOSE CA USA Monday April 5 1993 San Jose Mercury News Page 1   reproduce without permission    3,700 year tradition still glow assimilation in U.S. threaten ancient zoroastrian religion   by Jeanne Huber Mercury News Staff Writer high on a HILLSIDE above San Jose flame leap up 24 hour a day from a gleam brass urn in a temple one of only four in the United States dedicate to one of the world 's most ancient religion with the flame go the prayer of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land there be a fear a real fear too say Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette we have one generation to do it or to die many immigrant group struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land but for Zoroastrians it be an especially poignant concern their religion have be around for perhaps 3,700 year a heritage so deep it scarcely seem comprehensible in a state where historical site be sometimes less than 100 year old it be the religion of the great Persian Empire under king Cyrus and Darius and tradition say that when Christ be bear about 500 year later he be honor by a visit from three zoroastrian priest the Magi scholar say many key belief of Christians Jews and Muslims can be trace to the teaching of Zoroaster the zoroastrian prophet yet with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world they be a miniscule minority in every country in which they live Survival as a people be very much on their mind ironically local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundred of year of persecution follow by nearly 1,000 year of benign religious segregation could not do cause their young people to stop think of themselves as Zoroastrians zoroastrian do not believe theirs be the only right religion and they actually shun the notion of try to win convert so if their child become totally assimilate they say it 's their child rather than the world at large who will be the loser It 's important to have an identity say Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose a leader among Zoroastrians who come here from India It 's important for everybody irish Scottish Americans it give meaning to life you do n't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect you can fall back on your own identity for Zoroastrians there 's much to be proud of their prophet Zoroaster seek to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple god be common preach that there be only one god a good one zoroastrian call their god Ahura Mazda which translate as Lord of Wisdom and Light   good vs. evil   Zoroaster see life as a constant struggle between good and evil with the good eventually win man and woman could join in the battle for good he say and he warn that they would inevitably suffer consequence such as shame and sorrow if they do wrong he preach honesty charity kindness to animal respect for the environment hard work equality of man and woman basic virtue preach by prophet of many religion but Zoroaster be perhaps unusual in that he tell his follower not to follow he blindly he demand they think for themselves in fact Joseph Campbell the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myth trace the western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians Zoroastrians have many word for thought their motto lead into a stain glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slope of Mount Hamilton be good thought good word good deed so it 's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly in India where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrive in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy- the overall statistic in India be just 60 percent about half of the Bay Area zoroastrian community come here from India and Pakistan mostly to study at university the other half flee from Iran after the 1979 revolution make that a fundamentalist islamic state where other have no right Local Zoroastrians point with pride to way their emphasis on good deed have improve life in every country they inhabit in San Jose the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie come about because Manou Mobedshahi a San Francisco base hotelier pass the board up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple at the temple 's dedication the chief guest of honor be the mother of Zubin Mehta the zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra the temple exist because of another good deed the decision by an iranian emigre the late Arbab Rustom Guiv to buy land for six temple in North America besides the 10 acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton he pay for land in Los Angeles Chicago New York Toronto and Vancouver until his gift there be no zoroastrian temple on this continent Local Zoroastrians raise money to build the actual temple and the property already have a large house that they have convert to a community center the temple dedicate a year ago on the birthday of the prophet Zoroaster be a simple structure with gleam white wall vault ceiling and oak floor partially cover with huge oriental carpet its central feature be the fire set in the middle of a partly glassed- in area at the center of the building although Zoroastrians be sometimes call fire worshipper they actually consider fire just a symbol of God it help we concentrate just like Christians use the cross and Muslims use the Holy Book Bhujwala say the big celebration of the year occur in early spring for all Iranians include Zoroastrians the New Year begin on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life with Zoroaster 's birthday just six day later the combination of religious and secular holiday create something on par with what most of the United States celebrate between Christmas and Jan. 1 for this year 's celebration of the prophet 's birthday about 500 people come to worship and revel the good thing in life be not forbid Esfandiar Anoushiravani a leader of the iranian member have say beforehand and what follow prove he right inside the temple worshiper fill every chair and sit or stand around the edge of the room as about a half dozen priest chant thanksgive prayer around a table laden with brazier of smoking sandalwood glass of milk and water and a tray heap with dry fruit and nut kid crowd around grab handfuls of the treat People eat the fruit Tarapore say It 's a way to participate in the ceremony   Santa Claus sort of   the gathering even have a Santa Claus iranian style with flow white hair and a bag of gift for the child this Amownaroz wear green symbolic of spring and red he be ushe in by a sort of spring clown Hajefyrouz who dance and play a tambourine the Zoroastrians from India be charm this be all new for we too one tell a visitor who ask what be go on a visitor John A. Sabanovich of Folsom say he become intrigue with the religion year ago while on business trip to Iran zoroastrian have no procedure for accept convert a result some say of their century of persecution in Iran follow by their promise to the Hindu king who allow they into India that they would not interfere with his people 's religion but that do not stop Sabavich from join in the celebration at the San Jose temple whenever he can when I first hear about this religion he say I think my God this be what a religion should be they think for themselves and do good People who do n't have a tradition something to lean on what 's the difference with the low animal;3

11;I be happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an INTERACTIVE full color image viewer and editor base on SGI GL besides typical touchup task such as crop rotate smooth etc bit offer some unique feature not available in similar program such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image the following be the relevant section from the man page Pre Release of May 1993 BIT(1L name bit bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations description bit be an interactive full color image viewer and editor base on Silicon Graphics GL as a full color program bit handle image of both 24bit and color index in a natural and efficient manner as an image viewer bit allow list of image to be display in their original type 24bit or color index in any order and in any of the many build in style of display you can walk up and down the list use mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the SlideShow with the pan and zoom feature large image can be view in full without be limit by the window or screen size as an image editor bit perform a large number of image editing and processing task accurately and efficiently it keep information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by perform subpixel sampling automatically while conserve the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion andor quantization of input image you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figure can be render on top of an image for annotation with the option to make they part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the high printer resolution e.g. PostScript Bit can also be use as a graphical user interface to many exist image processing program by define external binding which in essence turn command line orient program into bit subfunction and can be access by a press of a button and good of all the process image will be read back and display immediately convolution use exter- nally define matrix of arbitrary order can be perform dynamically give great flexibility in process an image features Bit perform all of its image manipulation interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing be complete the process image will be display current feature include o rotate an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and fill the rotate out region with an arbitrary color o scale an image by arbitrary factor in x- andor y direction with the option of subpixel sampling o render text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of render directly into the raster or save the text and raster separately such as into a PostScript file to take advantage of a high printer resolution besides normal text string many predefine special symbol can be input conveniently as in TeX(1 e.g.   lphasmalleta produce Greek alphabet alpha follow by a slightly small greek alphabet beta o present graphically the histogram of an image o perform arbitrary 1 to-1 pixel transformation the transformation function can be specify interactively and can be of arbitrary form far the transformation can be apply to RGB channel separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult task such as thresholding can be accomplish rather easily by 1 to-1 transformation in combination with the avai- lability of graphical histogram of the image o place simple geometric figure SGFs e.g. arrow circle trian- gle etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary location address either in absolute pixel or in some user definable coordinate system unit with the option of render directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately e.g PostScript file all SGFs can be scale in x- and y direction independently or simultaneously this be how to get an ellipse from a circle o perform edge detection in combination with image histogram and 1- to-1 transformation very accurate result can be obtain o perform histogram equalization o perform convolution with externally define square matrix of arbitrary order o crop a rectangular portion of an image o cut and paste across image o magnifie any portion of an image by any amount o display a list of image in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between image SlideShow o measure RGB intensity of a pixel at any location or all pixel along an arbitrary line with the result present as RGB intensity or as an intensity vs. distance plot o perform image type conversion o convert image format o Smoothes an image special convolution o filter an image by external program and read the filter image back and display it o modify an individual pixel 's RGB value o perform FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the result power spectra o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release support FORMATS o IRIS RGB native to SGI IRIS o JPEG(JFIF format o CompuServ GIF o pnm(portable any Map include PPM PGM and PBM o XBM X Window Bitmap o TIFF o PostScript(Write only Hardware requirement any SGI workstation that support RGBmode include indigo where to get it anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu pub   bit   bitxxx.tar z where xxx be the version number current version be 0.73 Read src01Readme for installation instruction after unpack Acknowledgement jpeg support be base on the Independent JPEG groups 's library Version 4 FORMS library develop by Mark Overmars be use for GUI both JPEG and FORMS library be include in this release Bit be the program you will ever need to view and annotate images- the build in editing feature will satisfy most of your editing need in addition the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it and you will like it;1

24;this discussion on objective seem to be fall into solipsism eg the recent challenge from Frank Dwyer for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena someone even make the statement that science be subjective and that even atom be subjective this be get a bit silly and the word objective be lose all meaning let start by remember the definition of objective which have be already present objective ADJ 1 of or have to do with a material object as distinguish from a mental concept 2 have actual existence 3.a unenfluence by emotion or personal prejudice b. base on observable phenomenon the Objectivity of a thing be not base on whether everyone agree on that thing eg the world be objectively round regardless of the fact that there exist flat earther but rather whether it be base observable and verifiable phenomenon instead of be base solely on people wish feel mental process etc thus atom be base on very observable and repeatable phenomenon be indeed consider to be objective rather than subjective even weird high energy physics be base on observable phenomenon even though that observation can change the outcome nor be those observable phenomenon affect by emotion or personal prejudice eg chemical reaction do not change to the whim of different people thus to say that science be not objective ie objectively verifiable be a bit silly as that be the point of science now I will agree that science be not objectively good- I will not thereby conclude though that science be not objective now some example thing which be objective a D-12 tractor be large than the average breadbox Chlorophyll be green Seawater contain salt there exist ozone in the atmosphere at least presently ozone block ultraviolet light Ultraviolet light increase the incident of skin Cancer good on the other hand be a value judgement it does n't seem to have an existence apart from what we give it unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which have define good we can not quantify it touch it or collect it in any concrete sense eg I have a bag full of good now we do sometimes attempt to give the word good an objective meaning e.g. good have be use to denote strength resiliency speed etc that though be a subjective definition as some might not see strength and etc as necessarily good eg strength inspire by Naziism be not generally view as good as to a morality I can not say that I have ever see a morality strictly base on verifiable observable phenomenon the close I have see be some form of the Golden Rule which conclude that it be good not to deliberately piss people off as they will likely then involve themselves in your life in a manner you wo n't like this be verifiable- when you get in someone 's face they will often retaliate another objective fact about morality be that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weak group and thus can at time ignore that form of the Golden Rule without fear of reprisal now as to whether this enforcing of morality be good or bad be quite subjective by the way remember that subjective do not mean that a thing can not be formally state or even commonly agree upon- it only mean that that it be not verifiable from observable phenomenon or have a physical existence unto itself also note that I have not state that there be no such thing as an objective morality or that I could not accept any such a morality- I have simply state that I have see no evidence of any such morality one other thing to notice objective be many time use as synonymous with true andor absolute and subjective sometimes have the connotation of false andor relative tain't necessarily so for instance when a conclusion be base on objective but insufficient evidence then it can be both objective and false as to absolute it be easy to note that while we can objectively show that TNT be explosive but that do not absolutely mean that all TNT will explode and thus objective be not necessarily absolute either on the other hand something subjective can also be either absolutist or true for instance there be some theist who be specifically absolutist in their morality even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up far many a scientist and detective have be motivate by subjective reason eg a gut feeling or hunch to investigate a phenomena or situation and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis on the whole though I would have to agree that objective evidence be much more trustworthy than subjective evidence ttttLater ttttdave Butler;3

26;no it follow from the fact that most christians choice of interpretation stem from a mix of belief that be influence by the secular ethic of their culture and that be not fully determine by scripture whether or not there be some right interpretation matter not- few Christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god Dave Davis should note that it be Michael who first state the importance of secular and cultural influence in this thread I think Michael be right in this but regardless it should be note that this have   not   be a point of contention between Michael and myself I have argue beyond Michael 's claim that the christian scripture be open to so many interpretation include a wide divergence within the christian tradition that even their most important theme be vague again it do not matter that there be some right interpretation   unless   there be a way to determine what that right interpretation be it be the lack of an objective measure not the presume lack of an answer that put the force behind the line I argue there be enough christian glass vary over a sufficiently broad range of color that I can find a few that support my example in my opinion what make Michael radical be that he fully acknowledge that christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrine that so many branch within Christianity hold dear he be willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy and he be willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of thing Christian be influence by idea that be not purely Christian those Christians I have call conservative must also interpret but they do not recognize or at least be unwilling to admit the extent and importance of this I recognize that Michael be part of the tradition but what do it tell one about a tradition cover Origen Aquinas Jerry Fallwell and Jesse Jackson that it also include Michael Siemon not very much I think the conclusion do follow the purely christian principle that Michael have be the one he share with other in the christian tradition or that can be derive from christian scripture these necessarily vague be not enough to drive his political stance that one should love one 's neighbor be a purely christian principle that this mean show tolerance for homosexuality be   not   as to these political stance they be often at odd with what be commonly hold in most of current Christendom and so I suspect they could be well press outside it on the other hand I can well understand the counterpoint that these political stance become most influential when present to those who need they most having barely survive the effort to finish in computer science I doubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon;3

28;in an attempt to do animation with POV I have create two little program one be a c program that will perform a morph between any two point give the amount of frame for the morph and then it will write the point and the function translate rotate etc out to a file then I have a perl script that will read the list of function and insert they into a .pov file at a give line I have hope this would let I do simple animation however I have discover that simply perform incremental rotation on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there must be another way around this I have think perhaps it be because I have create object at the origin and then translate they to a new point and then do the rotation which could cause this behavior however this occur on object that be not translate at all any help be appreciate;1
29;isaackuoskippy.berkeley.edu Isaac Kuo state in reply to delete article about no knock search arrest in general no knock raid be to preserve evidence like drug which can be flush down the toilet they be not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber if there be no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hand up if the suspect do not come out tear gas will be use comment on the BD omit it be not a method to apprehend criminal it be a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroy if a warrant be serve in the normal way it be the most dangerous way to arrest anyone the cop be charge into a room and they do n't know what be in it it be much safe to surround the place and announce yourself cop be not cop   until   they identify themselves as police officer Most drug dealer and professional criminal be aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system work if they be arrest they call their lawyer post bail and hope for a plea bargain if they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charge with first degree murder if they survive the raid drug dealer have gun for protection from their customer and other criminal not to shoot cop cop be shoot on no knock drug raid because the criminal are n't aware that they be cop no knock raid on home occupy by non criminal be more likely to end in disaster mom and pop citizen   know   that they have not commit any crime they know that anyone break into their house can not be a cop because they have do nothing wrong if they have the mean to defend themselves they may because they know that the housebreaker be criminal not cop cop and homeowner may die the first report from Waco state that the ATF have a warrant to search for illegal weapon and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapon be find in this case the no knock warrant be not call for it be difficult to flush a gun down the toilet the ATF could have surround the compound a marked police car could have drive up to the entrance and uniformed officer could have knock and serve the warrant usual way it this have happen and and Koresh refuse the warrant or drive the cop off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folk would have keep quiet;3

usually one ask what the other   side mean usually one do usually you 're clear but sometimes you are n't and I ask you what you mean- other time you seem to get extremely uptight and I feel that I 'm debate against line noise sometimes I get tired and sometimes I have other thing i 'd rather do again this be USENET and life be tough all over you 're go to have to deal with it    e you 're start to get personally insulting- I may not even put your name    in the hat in future    That 's suppose to be a threat no that be a simple statement and an assertion that I be not answerable to those who offer I baseless insult for example those who accuse I of lie about my personal belief while also complain that I do n't answer their question     like that you what you sense be evidence for the sense to be there     if only everything would be so easy      what almost everyone sense be evidence for the sense to be there    because to all intent and purpose it   be   there     we have that argument for one your claim that everyone sense it   be not found and you have be ask to give evidence for it often   and then the correct statement would be it be reason to assume that it   be there unless evidence against it have be find I have no problem with the second statement I have provide an argument that almost everyone sense that freedom be valuable the only cogent objection to this come from jon livesey and be offer by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concept such as Freedom It 's a good point and I 'm think about it    your trick be to say I feel a be not right and so do many I know   therefore A be absolutely right it neglect the possibility that   these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process   restrict the claim of its absoluteness to those who have be subject   of that process in other word refute it you make the ontological   claim you have to prove it nonsense my trick be to say I feel that a be well than b and so do almost any disinterested person I ask good evidence be therefore that a really be well than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the result system of value be self consistent now get this really be well be an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence be a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true it be nonetheless a useful   assumption   far more useful than the equally assume relativist trick to wit I feel that a be well than B and so do almost any disinterested person I ask however if even one person disagree that a be well than B or if even one person dissent from mutually agree definition of A and B then it be the case that b be well than a for that person and nothing more can be say I say this be useless because it inexorably imply that a supermajority seek to maximise a can not morally take action against someone seek to maximise B e.g. a terrorist to do that would be to claim that a supermajority 's carefully consider morality would be well than the terrorist 's which would of course be true but a no no for an ethical relativist to claim that ethical relativism imply anything else be simply weasel word and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion     for a similar argument I sense morality be subjective it do not     hurt I to do thing that be consider to be objectively wrong by     other      if you mean that you do thing that some other consider objectively    wrong and it turn out not to be the case for you of course this    be possible it be neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence    against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense     it serve as a counterexample for that everything that be subject to   judgement be absolute and as long as you do n't provide evidence for   that there be something universally agree upon there be no reason to   believe your hypothesis i 've do this freedom with the proviso that I still have to answer jon 's objection that fuzzy concept like freedom have no objective meaning   far in order to make morality absolute universal or objective   you would have to show that it be independent of human or the attribute   above look quite misleading not really what evidence be there that   anything   exist independently of human You 'll be hard pressed to find any that is n't logically equivalent when apply to value    an analogous set of premise would be      Premise 1 some people believe that objectively speak the short    route from my house to a bar be through the main entrance    of the estate and down the Malahide road      Premise 2 I check it out and find that the short route from my    which be much close      you would never deduce from these that there be no short route from my    house to a bar- yet that be seemingly how you derive your relativist claim    use premise which be logically no different      no moral be a matter of belief so far the people still believe that the   short way be through the main entrance no agreement on   belief   here   and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there be a   short way and that there be a method to convince everyone of that it   be the short way indeed in other word your analogy work only when   one assume that your premise be right in the first place if not it be   a fallacy and if this be an argument for objectivism you 'd be right it is n't though it 's a demonstration that the argument you give I be neither argument   against   objectivism nor argument   for   relativism your gimmick be to assume in the first place that value are n't real and to use this to prove that value are n't real in other word you beg the question against I;0

Union 's mighty PROTON rocket lift off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan Republic aboard those booster be a new breed of VENERA probe for the planet Venus Designated VENERA 15 and 16 the probe be mean not for landing yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit to accomplish this task the basic VENERA design be modify in numerous area the central bus core be make one meter 39.37 inch long to carry the two ton of propellant require for brake into orbit double the fuel carry by the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiter eight year early extra solar panel be add on to give the vehicle more power for handle the large amount of datum which would be create by the radar imaging the dish shape communication antennae be also make one meter large to properly transmit this information to Earth atop the bus where lander be usually place be instal the 1.4 by 6 meter 4.62 by 19.8 foot 300 kilogram 660 pound POLYUS V side look radar antennae the radar system possibly a terrain image version of the nuclear power satellite use by the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance would be able to map Venus surface at a resolution of one to two kilometer 0.62 to 1.2 mile the soviet probes imaging parameter be a vast improvement over the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter which could reveal object no small than 75 kilometer 45 mile in diameter and while the veneras resolution be comparable to that of similar observation make by the 300 meter 1,000 foot Arecibo radio telescope on the island of Puerto Rico the orbiter would be examine the northern pole of Venus this region be unobtainable by either Arecibo or PIONEER VENUS and appear to contain a number of potentially interesting geological feature worthy of investigation on October 10 1983 after an interplanetary journey of 330 million kilometer 198 million mile and two mid course correction VENERA 15 fire its brake rocket over Venus to place itself in a polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometer 600 by 39,000 mile around the planet complete one revolution every twenty four hour VENERA 16 follow suit four day later the twin probe thus become Venus first polar circle spacecraft Radar operation begin on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 for VENERA 16 for up to sixteen minute every orbit over the north pole the probe would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometer ninety mile wide and nine thousand kilometer 5,400 mile long the craft would then head out to the high part of their orbit over the south pole to recharge their battery and transmit the datum back to two large soviet antennae on Earth each strip of information take eight hour to process by computer by the end of their main mission in July of 1984 the venera have map 115 million square kilometer 46 million square mile thirty percent of the entire planet VENERA 15 and 16 reveal that Venus have a surface geology more complex than show by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970 numerous hill mountain ridge valley and plain spread across the landscape many of they apparently form by lava from erupt volcano in the last one billion year in planetary term this make the Venerean surface rather young hundred of crater be detect as well the large of which have to have be create by meteorite planetoid would be a well term here at least fourteen kilometer 8.4 mile across due to venus very dense atmosphere there be some disagreement between U.S. and soviet scientist on the origin of certain surface feature for example the probes owner declare that the 96 kilometer 57.6 mile wide crater at the summit of 10,800 meter 35,640 foot high Maxwell Montes the tall mountain on the planet be the result of a meteorite impact american scientist on the other hand feel the crater be proof that Maxwell be a huge volcano sit on the northern continent of Ishtar Terra in any event the U.S. decide to wait on make verdict about Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe schedule for later in the decade originally name the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar VOIR its initial design be scale back and the craft be redesig- nate the Venus Radar Mapper VRM eventually the machine would be call MAGELLAN after the portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan circa 1480 1521 this vehicle would map the entire planet in even fine detail than the venera for the time however the Soviet probe maintain that distinction Radar imaging be not the only ability of the venera bolt next to the POLYUS V radar antenna be the Omega altimeter and the Fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measure the world 's temperature the majority of the area cover register about five hundred degree Celsius 932 degree Fahrenheit but a few location be two hundred degree hotter possibly indicate current volcanic activity the probe also find that the cloud over the pole be five to eight kilometer three to 4.8 mile lower than at the equator in contrast the polar air above sixty kilometer thirty six mile altitude be five to twenty degree warm than the equatorial atmosphere at similar height when the main mapping mission end in July of 1984 there be plan for at least one of the venera to radar image the surface at more southernly latitude unfortunately this idea do not come to pass as the orbiter may not have possess enough attitude control gas to perform the operation VENERA 15 and 16 cease transmission in March of 1985 leave the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six hundred kilometer 360 mile of radar datum tape to sort into an atlas of twenty seven map of the northern hemisphere of Venus Venus by Balloon for year the thick atmosphere of Venus have be a tempting target to scientist who wish to explore the planet 's mantle of air with balloon bear instrument Professor Jacques Blamont of the french space agency Centre National d'etude Spatiales CNES have propose such an idea as far back as 1967 only to have a joint french soviet balloon mission cancel in 1982 nevertheless late in the year 1984 such dream would eventually come true when two PROTON rocket be send skyward on December 15 and 21 the Soviet Union provide western observer with the first clear full view of the booster which have be launch every Soviet Venus probe since 1975 this be but one of many first for the complex mission the unmanned probe launch into space that December be name VEGA 1 and 2 a contraction of the word VENERA and GALLEI Gallei be the russian word for Halley not only do the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform they also have more than one celestial objective to explore namely the comet Halley this famous periodic traveler be make its late return to the inner region of the solar system since its last visit in 1910 since it be widely believe that comet be the icy remain from the formation of the solar system five billion year ago scientist around the world give high priority to explore one of the few such body which actually come close to Earth Most comet linger in the cold and dark outer fringe of the solar system some like Halley be perturb by various force and fall in towards the Sun where they circle for millennia spew out ice and debris for million of kilometer from the warmth of each solar encounter the Soviet Union along with the European Space Agency ESA and Japan 's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science ISAS do not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of Halley the ESA would be use the cylindrical GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet while Japan 's first deep space craft SAKIGAKE Pioneer and SUISEI Comet would view Halley from a much safe distance scientist in the United States also desire to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe at one time envision a vessel power by solar sail or ion engine however government budget cut to NASA cancel the american effort the U.S. would have to make do primarily with earth base observation and the sharing of datum from other nation though an instrument name the Dust Counter and Mass Analyzer DUCMA design by Chicago University Professor John Simpson be add on the soviet mission in May of 1984 the Soviets answer to Halley be the vega instead of build an entirely new craft for the mission the Soviets decide to modify their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while perform an advanced Venus mission along the way as VEGA 1 and 2 reach Venus the bus would drop off one lander   balloon each and use the mass of the shrouded planet to swing they towards comet Halley much as the U.S. probe MARINER 10 use Venus to flyby Mercury eleven year early the soviet craft would then head on to Halley help to pinpoint the location of the comet 's erupt nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive in only 605 kilometer 363 mile away in March of 1986 as plan the two vega arrive at Venus in June of 1985 VEGA 1 release its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander make a two day descent towards the planet the craft touch the upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11 sixty one kilometer 36.6 mile above the venerean surface a small container be release by the lander which produce a parachute at 55 kilometer 33 mile altitude thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus have successfully arrive one kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas be pump into the Teflon coat plastic balloon inflate it to a diameter of 3.54 meter 11.68 foot dangle on a tether thirteen meter 42.9 foot below be the instrument package properly know as an aerostat the top part of the 6.9 kilogram 15.18 pound aerostat consist of a cone which serve as an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon beneath it be the transmitter electronic and instrument connect at the bottom be a nephelometer for measure cloud particle the aerostat be paint with a special white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which permeate the planet 's atmosphere the VEGA 1 balloon be drop into the night side of Venus just north of the equator scientist be concern that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight so they place it in the darken hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return datum this action necessitate that the lander come down in the dark as well effectively remove the camera system use on previous mission the author wonder though if they could have use floodlight similar to the one attach to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975 when soviet scientist have think the planet 's surface be enshroud in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover the first balloon transmit for 46.5 hour right into the day hemisphere before its lithium battery fail cover 11,600 kilometer 6,960 mile the threat of burst in the day heat do not materialize the VEGA 1 balloon be station at a 54 kilometer 32.4 mile altitude after drop ballast at fifty kilometer thirty mile for this be consider the most active of the three main cloud layer report by PIONEER VENUS in 1978 indeed the balloon be push across the planet at speed up to 250 kilometer 150 mile per hour strong vertical wind bob the craft up and down two to three hundred meter 660 to 990 foot through most of the journey the layer 's air temperature average forty degree Celsius 104 degree Fahrenheit and pressure be a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere the nephelometer could find no clear region in the surround cloud early in the first balloon 's flight the VEGA 1 lander be already head towards the Venerean surface both lander be equip with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the one carry on VENERA 13 and 14 in 1982 however VEGA 1 would become unable to report the composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia the Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra while still ten to fifteen minute away from landing a timer malfunction cause the drill to accidentally begin its program activity sixteen kilometer 9.6 mile above the surface there be neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after land this be unfortunate not only for the general loss of datum but also for the fact that most of Venus be cover with such smooth low level lava plain and have never before be directly examine nevertheless the surface temperature and pressure be calculate at 468 degree Celsius 874.4 degree Fahrenheit and 95 Earth atmosphere respectively during the lander 's 56 minute of ground transmission a large amount of background infrared radiation be also record at the site as have be do when the drill and camera on VENERA 11 and 12 have fail in December of 1978 the Soviets focus on the datum return during the lander 's plunge through the atmosphere the French soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detect sulfur chlorine and possibly phosphorus it be the sulfur possibly from active volcano which give the Venerean cloud their yellowish color the Sigma 3 gas chromatograph find that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometer 28.8 and 37.8 mile contain one milligram 0.015 grain of sulfuric acid the VEGA 1 datum on the overall structure of the cloud deck appear to be at odd with the information from PIONEER VENUS the case be make even strong by the fact that VEGA 2 's result nearly match its twin the vega find only two main cloud layer instead of the three report by the U.S. probe the layer be three to five kilometer 1.8 to 3 mile thick at altitude of 50 and 58 kilometer 30 and 34.8 mile the cloud persist like a thin fog until clear at an altitude of 35 kilometer 21 mile much low than the pv reading one possibility for the discrepan- cie may have be radical structural change in the venerean air over the last seven year when the lander and balloon finally go silent the last function part of the VEGA 1 mission the flyby bus sail on for a 708 million kilometer 424.8 million mile journey around the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley on March 6 1986 the bus make a 8,890 kilometer 5,334 mile pass at the dark and icy visitor before travel on in interplanetary space the Soviets have accomplish their first mission to two celestial body with one space vessel on June 13 VEGA 2 release its lander   balloon payload for a two day fall towards Venus like its duplicate the VEGA 2 balloon radio information back to the twenty antennae tracking it on Earth for 46.5 hour before battery failure on the morning side of the planet during its 11,100 kilometer 6,660 mile flight over Venus the second balloon enter in a rather still environment which become less so twenty hour into the mission after 33 hour mission time the air become even more turbulent for a further eight hour when the balloon pass over a five- kilometer three mile mountain on the continent of Aphrodite Terra a powerful downdraft pull the craft 2.5 kilometer 1.5 mile towards the surface temperature sensor on the VEGA 2 balloon report that the air layer it be move through be consistently 6.5 degree Celsius 43.7 degree Fahrenheit cool than the area explore by the VEGA 1 balloon this be corroborate by the VEGA 2 lander as it pass through the balloon 's level no positive indication of lightning be make by either balloon and the second aerostat 's nephelometer fail to function the VEGA 2 lander touch down on the northern edge of Aphrodite Terra 's western arm on the fifteenth of June 1,500 kilometer 900 mile southeast of VEGA 1 the lander 's resting place be smooth than thought indicate either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one cover in fresh lava the soil drill be in working order and report a rock type know as anorthosite troctolite rare on Earth but present in luna 's highland this rock be rich in aluminum and silicon but lack in iron and magnesium a high degree of sulfur be also present in the soil the air around VEGA 2 measure 463 degree Celsius 865.4 degree Fahrenheit and 91 Earth atmosphere essentially a typical day or night on Venus far above the VEGA 2 lander its carrier bus speed past Venus at a distance of 24,500 kilometer 14,700 mile and follow its twin to comet Halley make a close flyby on March 9 1986 at just 8,030 kilometer 4,818 mile both probe help to reveal that the comet be a very dark and irregular shaped mass about fourteen kilometer 8.4 mile across rotate once every 53 hour give or take three hour since both VEGA craft be still function after their Halley encounter soviet scientist consider an option to send the probe to other celestial object one prime target be the near- Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance of six million kilometer 3.6 million mile sadly the Soviets have to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it be discover that there be not enough maneuver fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as plan VEGA 1 and 2 be quietly shut down in early 1987 future Plans divert the impressive VEGA mission have give some scientist numerous idea and hope for even more ambitious expedition to the second world from the Sun one example be the VESTA mission plan for the early 1990 this Soviet French collaboration call for the launch of multiple probe on a single proton rocket in either 1991 or 1992 the craft would first swing by Venus and drop off several lander and balloon probe the aerostat would be design to survive in the planet 's corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over the VEGA balloons two day the mission would then head out to investigate several planetoid and comet include a possible landing on Vesta thus the mission name the most reflective Main Belt planetoid as see from Earth unfortunately for Venus exploration plan begin to change in the Soviet Union in 1986 the Soviets decide to reroute the VESTA mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus keep the comet and planetoid aspect intact by this time in the soviet space program interest be focus on Mars already under construction be an entirely new probe design call PHOBOS two member of this class be plan to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next year phobos 1 and 2 would then place the first instrument on Mars large moon Phobos all this be a prelude to even more advanced Mars expedition include balloon probe rover soil sample return craft and eventually human explorer in the early Twenty First Century the environment of Venus be just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future but thing begin to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars exploration both phobos probe fail to complete their mission one lose contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other go silent in Mars orbit just one week before the plan moon landing in March of 1989 in 1989 a plan be devise for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrator around the planet in 1998 several year later the mission launch date be move to the year 2005 and have now be put on indefinite hold no other official soviet mission to Venus have since be put forth a sad commentary after twenty five year of continuous robotic exploration of the planet during the late 1980 a drastic political and economic change be take over the Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev begin to open up his nation to the benefit of increase cooperation with the rest of the nation particularly those in the West while the culture become less oppressive than in the past the economy be take a very rough ride as it also undergo the effect of a free market these effect hit everywhere include the space program mission at all level be cut back the Soviets begin make almost desperate attempt to cooperate with other space fare nation either to keep their remain program alive or just to make money in early 1992 it be report that the Soviets be offer for sale several fully equip venera they have in storage for the price of 1.6 million dollar each an incredibly low price for any planetary probe no nation take they up on the bargain meanwhile the United States be gear up for new Venus mission of their own MAGELLAN and GALILEO the U.S. reactivate their long dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4 1989 aboard the shuttle be the MAGELLAN spacecraft a combination of spare part from other U.S. probe design to make the most detailed and complete radar mapping of Venus in history when MAGELLAN reach the second world in August of 1990 it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108 meter 360 foot surpass the ability of VENERA 15 and 16 in the interim another american probe be launch from a Space Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit the giant planet Jupiter in 1995 on October 18 1989 the Shuttle ATLANTIS release its second unmanned planetary probe into space name GALILEO after the famous italian astronomer who discover the probe 's primary target 's major moon in 1610 in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe be send around Venus and Earth several time to build up enough speed to reach Jupiter as a result Venus become GALILEO 's first planetary goal in February of 1990 the probe radio back image of the planet 's swirl cloud and further indication of lightning in that violent atmosphere on the Drawing Boards with the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few year new plan have be lay out for further journey to Venus Scien- tist in the U.S. have talk to space scientist in the former Soviet Union now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1 1992 of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander mission within in the next decade Japan India and the ESA have also consider their own Venus mission in the next few decade in February of 1993 NASA come up with several new Venus project as part of their Discovery Program for launch inexpensive probe throughout the solar system for Venus two mission be select for further study a Venus Multiprobe Mission involve the landing of fourteen small probe over one hemisphere to measure wind air temperature and pressure- and the Venus Composition Probe design to study Venus atmosphere while descend through the thick air with the aid of a parachute much as the Soviets have do since 1967 final project decision will be make in 1994 human on Venus will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus at present the lead melt temperature and crush air pressure would be threaten to any Earth life not protect in something even tough than a VENERA lander plan have be look into change the environment of Venus itself into something more like Earth 's however it should be note that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability to speed up the planet 's rotation rate to something a bit fast than once every 243 Earth day such a project may take century if not millennia in the meantime effort should be make to well understand Venus as its exist today we still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important way become instead such a deadly place will Earth ever suffer this fate perhaps Venus hold the answer such answer may well be find through international cooperation include the nation which make the first attempt to lift the cloudy veil from Venus Bibliography Barsukov V.

85;  the   problem with Oort cloud source be that absolutely no plausible mechanism have be propose it would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell close to conventional Oort source be a model of b field pinch by comet it 's get too many hole in it to count but at least it be a good try so you have a plausible model for GRB 's at astronomical distance recent observation have just about rule out the merge neutron star hypothesis which have a lot of problem anyhow we have to look for implausible model and what be fundamentally allow independent of model a paper on the possibility of GRB 's in the Oort cloud just come through the astrophysic abstract service to get a copy of this paper send a message to astro-phbabbage.sissa.it with the subject line get 9304001 here be the abstract of that paper the currently favor explanation for the origin of grb put they at cosmological distances- but as long as there be no distance indicator to these event all possible source which be isotropically distribute should remain under consideration this be why the Oort cloud of comet be keep on the list although there be no known mechanism for generate grb from cometary nucleus unlikely as it may seem the possibility that GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud can not be exclude until it be disprove we use the available datum on the distribution of grb the BATSE catalogue up to March 1992 and the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams 1992 to investigate whether there be any observational indication for correlation between the angular distribution of grb and comets aphelia assume that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect at least to some extent true variation in the column density of the Oort cloud we also apply the   ov test to both distribution;2
86;look at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame There 's no inside and no outside there be just two polarize view as for statement inside the Bible thing be still not that clear we do n't have any indication for instance why Jobs be place in the Old Testament one of the few book that actually talk about Satan Jobs be very much out of line with the rest of the OT book and there 's a chance that someone add this book later into the group of OT scripture this operate the other way around as well you have to understand the mind of an atheist agnostic or as in my case a radical relativist if you do n't understand the underlying concept it be pretty hard to continue with a dialogue I 'm not a perfect Christian however about 20   year of christian teaching should have provide I with a pretty good picture of the christian mind frame cheer Kent;3

92;well here go the first item of business be to establish the importance space life science in the whole of scheme of humankind I mean compare to football and baseball the average joe schmoe does n't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education all of we in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be release to the general public around the world the document would scientifically analyze the technical aspect of long term human habitation in space I believe that if any long term space exploration program be to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld i.e. the spacecraft only through the careful analysis of engineering chemical biological and medical factor will a good ecosystem be create to facilitate human life on a long duration flight so I would like to see post of opinion regard the most objective method to analyze the accept scientific literature for technology which can be apply to long duration spaceflight such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocate and clearly important to exist space program in essence we would be divide the space life science issue into various technical problem which could be solve with various technology this database of acceptable solution to various problem could form the basis of detailed discussion involve people from the bionet isunet and any other source;2

111;sadly understandable yes to be fair you should really qualify this as semitic western religion but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway again this should really be evaluate at a personal level for example there be only one Jesus presumably and he probably did n't say all that many thing and yet seemingly billion and billion of Christian sect have arise perhaps there be one that be totally dedicated to rationalism and believe in Christ as in pantheism it would seem to go against the Bible but it be amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation this be a good point we have here the quintessential Christian he set up a system of value   belief for himself which work very well and every event   experience be understandable and deablable within the framework of this system however we also have an individual who have the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which be important because the problem with such a system be the same as with any system one can not be open minded to the point of testing hypothesis against the basic premise of the system without destroy whatever faith be invest therein unless of course all the test fail in other word the   fairer   way would be to test and evaluate morality without the bias   responsibility of losing   retain a system Interesting but again when it seem to basically boil down to individual nuance although not always I will admit and probably it be the mass orient division which be the most appalling it become irrelevant unfortunately grant in which case the people become the bullet and the religion as the gun merely offer they a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if I may be so bold as to extend your similie also understandable good regard;0

call these object planet mean wanderer and name they after roman deity Jupiter king of the gods- Mars the god of war- Mercury messenger of the gods- Venus the god of love and beauty and Saturn father of Jupiter and god of agriculture the stargazer also observe comet with sparkling tail and meteor or shoot star apparently fall from the sky Science flourish during the European Renaissance fundamental physical law govern planetary motion be discover and the orbit of the planet around the Sun be calculate in the 17th century astronomer point a new device call the telescope at the heaven and make startling discovery but the year since 1959 have amount to a golden age of solar system exploration advancement in rocketry after World War II enable our machine to break the grip of Earth 's gravity and travel to the Moon and to other planet the United States have send automate spacecraft then human crew expedition to explore the Moon our automate machine have orbit and land on Venus and Mars- explore the Sun 's environment- observed comet and make close range survey while fly past Mercury Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune these traveler bring a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system through the electronic sight and other sense of our automate spacecraft color and complexion have be give to world that for century appear to earth bind eye as fuzzy disk or indistinct point of light and dozen of previously unknown object have be discover Future historian will likely view these pioneer flight through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievement of the 20th century AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's NASA 's automate spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shape and size while they be design to fulfill separate and specific mission objective the craft share much in common each spacecraft consist of various scientific instrument select for a particular mission support by basic subsystem for electrical power trajectory and orientation control as well as for process datum and communicating with Earth electrical power be require to operate the spacecraft instrument and system NASA use both solar energy from array of photovoltaic cell and small nuclear generator to power its solar system mission rechargeable battery be employ for backup and supplemental power imagine that a spacecraft have successfully journey million of mile through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have its camera and other sense instrument point the wrong way as it speed past the target to help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thruster be use to control spacecraft the thruster be link with device that maintain a constant gaze at select star just as Earth 's early seafarer use the star to navigate the ocean spacecraft use star to maintain their bearing in space with the subsystem lock onto fix point of reference flight controller can keep a spacecraft 's scientific instrument point at the target body and the craft 's communication antenna point toward Earth the thruster can also be use to fine tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body be encounter at the plan distance and on the proper trajectory between 1959 and 1971 NASA spacecraft be dispatch to study the Moon and the solar environment- they also scan the inner planet other than Earth Mercury Venus and Mars these three world and our own be know as the terrestrial planet because they share a solid rock composition for the early planetary reconnaissance mission NASA employ a highly successful series of spacecraft call the Mariners their flight help shape the planning of later mission between 1962 and 1975 seven Mariner mission conduct the first survey of our planetary neighbor in space all of the Mariners use solar panel as their primary power source the first and the final version of the spacecraft have two wing cover with photovoltaic cell other Mariners be equip with four solar panel extend from their octagonal body although the Mariners range from the Mariner 2 Venus spacecraft weigh in at 203 kilogram 447 pound to the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter weigh in at 974 kilogram 2,147 pound their basic design remain quite similar throughout the program the Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft for example have originally be a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby the Mariner 10 spacecraft send to Venus and Mercury use component leave over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program in 1972 NASA launch Pioneer 10 a Jupiter spacecraft interest be shift to four of the outer planet Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune giant ball of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial world we have already survey four NASA spacecraft in all two Pioneers and two Voyagers be send in the 1970 to tour the outer region of our solar system because of the distance involve these traveler take anywhere from 20 month to 12 year to reach their destination bar fast spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifact to journey to distant star because the Sun 's light become so faint in the outer solar system these traveler do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generate by heat from the decay of radioisotope NASA also develop highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbor Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970 Twin Viking Landers be equip to serve as seismic and weather station and as biology laboratory two advanced orbiter descendant of the Mariner craft carry the Viking Landers from Earth and then study martian feature from above two drum shape Pioneer spacecraft visit Venus in 1978 the Pioneer Venus Orbiter be equip with a radar instrument that allow it to see through the planet 's dense cloud cover to study surface feature the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carry four probe that be drop through the cloud the probe and the main body all of which contain scientific instrument radio information about the planet 's atmosphere during their descent toward the surface a new generation of automated spacecraft include Magellan Galileo Ulysses Mars Observer the Comet Rendezvous   Asteroid Flyby CRAF and

the solar system must start with the Sun the Sun dwarf the other body represent approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system- all of the planet moon asteroid comet dust and gas add up to only about 0.14 percent this 0.14 percent represent the material leave over from the Sun 's formation one hundred and nine earth would be require to fit across the Sun 's disk and its interior could hold over 1.3 million earth as a star the Sun generate energy through the process of fusion the temperature at the Sun 's core be 15 million degree Celsius 27 million degree Fahrenheit and the pressure there be 340 billion time Earth 's air pressure at sea level the Sun 's surface temperature of 5,500 degree Celsius 10,000 degree Fahrenheit seem almost chilly compare to its core temperature at the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium produce energy the Sun also produce a strong magnetic field and stream of charge particle both extend far beyond the planet the Sun appear to have be active for 4.6 billion year and have enough fuel to go on for another five billion year or so at the end of its life the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavy element and begin to swell up ultimately grow so large that it will swallow Earth after a billion year as a red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf the final end product of a star like ours it may take a trillion year to cool off completely many spacecraft have explore the Sun 's environment but none have get any close to its surface than approximately two third of the distance from Earth to the Sun pioneer 5 11 the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sample the solar environment the Ulysses spacecraft launch on October 6 1990 be a joint solar mission of NASA and the European Space Agency after use Jupiter 's gravity to change its trajectory Ulysses will fly over the Sun 's polar region during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of study use nine onboard scientific instrument we be fortunate that the Sun be exactly the way it be if it be different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have develop on Earth Mercury obtain the first close up view of Mercury be the primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft launch on November 3 1973 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida after a journey of nearly five month which include a flyby of Venus the spacecraft pass within 703 kilometer 437 mile of the solar system 's innermost planet on March 29 1974 until Mariner 10 little be know about Mercury even the good telescopic view from Earth show Mercury as an indistinct object lack any surface detail the planet be so close to the Sun that it be usually lose in solar glare when the planet be visible on Earth 's horizon just after sunset or before dawn it be obscure by the haze and dust in our atmosphere only radar telescope give any hint of Mercury 's surface condition prior to the voyage of Mariner 10 the photograph Mariner 10 radio back to Earth reveal an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resemble our own Moon the picture also show huge cliff crisscross the planet these apparently be create when Mercury 's interior cool and shrank buckle the planet 's crust the cliff be as high as 3 kilometer 2 mile and as long as 500 kilometer 310 mile Instruments on Mariner 10 discover that Mercury have a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere a trillionth the density of Earth 's atmosphere and compose chiefly of argon neon and helium when the planet 's orbit take it close to the Sun surface temperature range from 467 degree celsius 872 degree Fahrenheit on Mercury 's sunlit side to -183 degree Celsius -298 degree Fahrenheit on the dark side this range in surface temperature 650 degree Celsius 1,170 degree Fahrenheit be the large for a single body in the solar system Mercury literally bake and freeze at the same time day and night be long on Mercury the combination of a slow rotation relative to the star 59 Earth day and a rapid revolution around the Sun 88 Earth day mean that one Mercury solar day take 176 Earth day or two Mercury year the time it take the innermost planet to complete two orbit around the Sun Mercury appear to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of Earth scientist believe Mercury have a heavy iron rich core make up slightly less than half of its volume that would make Mercury 's core large proportionally than the Moon 's core or those of any of the planet after the initial Mercury encounter Mariner 10 make two additional flyby on September 21 1974 and March 16 1975 before control gas use to orient the spacecraft be exhaust and the mission be conclude each flyby take place at the same local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet be illuminated- as a result we still have not see one half of the planet 's surface Venus veil by dense cloud cover Venus our near planetary neighbor be the first planet to be explore the Mariner 2 spacecraft launch on August 27 1962 be the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet mission to study the mysterious planet as spacecraft fly by or orbit Venus plunge into the atmosphere or gently land on Venus surface romantic myth and speculation about our neighbor be lay to rest on December 14 1962 Mariner 2 pass within 34,839 kilometer 21,648 mile of Venus and become the first spacecraft to scan another planet- onboard instrument measure Venus for 42 minute Mariner 5 launch in June 1967 fly much close to the planet pass within 4,094 kilometer 2,544 mile of Venus on the second american flyby Mariner 5 's instrument measure the planet 's magnetic field ionosphere radiation belt and temperature on its way to Mercury Mariner 10 fly by Venus and transmit ultraviolet picture to Earth show cloud circulation pattern in the venusian atmosphere in the spring and summer of 1978 two spacecraft be launch to far unravel the mystery of Venus on December 4 of the same year the Pioneer Venus Orbiter become the first spacecraft place in orbit around the planet five day later the five separate component make up the second spacecraft the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe enter the venusian atmosphere at different location above the planet the four small independent probe and the main body radio atmospheric datum back to Earth during their descent toward the surface although design to examine the atmosphere one of the probe survive its impact with the surface and continue to transmit datum for another hour Venus resemble Earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other know planet however spacecraft have discover significant difference as well for example Venus rotation west to east be retrograde backward compare to the east to west spin of Earth and most of the other planet approximately 96.5 percent of Venus atmosphere 95 time as dense as Earth 's be carbon dioxide the principal constituent of Earth 's atmosphere be nitrogen Venus atmosphere act like a greenhouse permit solar radiation to reach the surface but trap the heat that would ordinarily be radiate back into space as a result the planet 's average surface temperature be 482 degree celsius 900 degree Fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead a radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provide the first mean of see through the planet 's dense cloud cover and determine surface feature over almost the entire planet NASA 's Magellan spacecraft launch on May 5 1989 have be in orbit around Venus since August 10 1990 the spacecraft use radar mapping technique to provide ultrahigh resolution image of the surface Magellan have reveal a landscape dominate by volcanic feature fault and impact crater huge area of the surface show evidence of multiple period of lava flooding with flow lie on top of previous one an elevated region name Ishtar Terra be a lava fill basin as large as the United States at one end of this plateau sit Maxwell Montes a mountain the size of Mount Everest scar the mountain 's flank be a 100 kilometer 62 mile wide 2.5 kilometer 1.5 mile deep impact crater name Cleopatra almost all feature on Venus be name for women- Maxwell Montes Alpha Regio and Beta Regio be the exception crater survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million year because there be no water and very little wind erosion extensive fault line network cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flex that produce plate tectonic on Earth but on Venus the surface temperature be sufficient to weaken the rock which crack just about everywhere prevent the formation of major plate and large earthquake fault like the San Andreas Fault in California Venus predominant weather pattern be a high altitude high speed circulation of cloud that contain sulfuric acid at speed reach as high as 360 kilometer 225 mile per hour the cloud circle the planet in only four Earth day the circulation be in the same direction west to east as Venus slow rotation of 243 Earth day whereas Earth 's wind blow in both direction west to east and east to west in six alternate band Venus atmosphere serve as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather Earth as view from space our world 's distinguish characteristic be its blue water brown and green land masse and white cloud we be envelop by an ocean of air consist of 78 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituent the only planet in the solar system know to harbor life Earth orbit the Sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometer 93 million mile earth be the third planet from the Sun and the fifth large in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometer large than that of Venus our planet 's rapid spin and molten nickel iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shield we from nearly all of the harmful radiation come from the Sun and other star Earth 's atmosphere protect we from meteor as well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface active geological process have leave no evidence of the pelt Earth almost certainly receive soon after it form about 4.6 billion year ago along with the other newly form planet it be shower by space debris in the early day of the solar system from our journey into space we have learn much about our home planet the first american satellite Explorer 1 be launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31 1958 and discover an intense radiation zone now call the Van Allen radiation belt surround Earth since then other research satellite have reveal that our planet 's magnetic field be distort into a tear drop shape by the solar wind the stream of charge particle continuously eject from the Sun We 've learn that the magnetic field do not fade off into space but have definite boundary and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believe calm and uneventful seethe with activity swell by day and contracting by night affect by change in solar activity the upper atmosphere contribute to weather and climate on Earth besides affect Earth 's weather solar activity give rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere when charge particle from the solar wind become trap in Earth 's magnetic field they collide with air molecule above our planet 's magnetic pole these air molecule then begin to glow and be know as the aurora or the northern and southern light satellite about 35,789 kilometer 22,238 mile out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting these watchful electronic eye warn we of dangerous storm continuous global monitoring provide a vast amount of useful datum and contribute to a well understanding of Earth 's complex weather system from their unique vantage point satellite can survey Earth 's ocean land use and resource and monitor the planet 's health these eye in space have save countless life provide tremendous convenience and show we that we may be alter our planet in dangerous way the Moon the Moon be Earth 's single natural satellite the first human footstep on an alien world be make by american astronaut on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless companion in preparation for the human crew Apollo expedition NASA dispatch the automate Ranger Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968 NASA 's Apollo program leave a large legacy of lunar material and datum six two astronaut crew land on and explore the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972 carry back a collection of rock and soil weigh a total of 382 kilogram 842 pound and consist of more than 2,000 separate sample from this material and other study scientist have construct a history of the Moon that include its infancy rock collect from the lunar highland date to about 4.0 4.3 billion year old the first few million year of the Moon 's existence be so violent that few trace of this period remain as a molten outer layer gradually cool and solidify into different kind of rock the Moon be bombard by huge asteroid and small object some of the asteroid be as large as Rhode Island or Delaware and their collision with the Moon create basin hundred of kilometer across this catastrophic bombardment taper off approximately four billion year ago leave the lunar highland cover with huge overlap crater and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock heat produce by the decay of radioactive element begin to melt the interior of the Moon at depth of about 200 kilometer 125 mile below the surface then for the next 700 million year from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion year ago lava rise from inside the Moon the lava gradually spread out over the surface flood the large impact basin to form the dark area that Galileo Galilei an astronomer of the italian Renaissance call maria mean sea as far as we can tell there have be no significant volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion year since then the lunar surface have be alter only by micrometeorite by the atomic particle from the Sun and star by the rare impact of large meteorite and by spacecraft and astronaut if our astronaut have land on the Moon a billion year ago they would have see a landscape very similar to the one today thousand of year from now the footstep leave by the Apollo crew will remain sharp and clear the origin of the Moon be still a mystery four theory attempt an explanation the Moon form near Earth as a separate body- it be tear from Earth- it form somewhere else and be capture by our planet 's gravity or it be the result of a collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars the last theory have some good support but be far from certain Mars of all the planet Mars have long be consider the solar system 's prime candidate for harbor extraterrestrial life astronomer study the red planet through telescope see what appear to be straight line crisscross its surface these observation later determined to be optical illusion lead to the popular notion that intelligent being have construct a system of irrigation canal on the planet in 1938 when Orson Welles broadcast a radio drama base on the science fiction classic War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells enough people believe in the tale of invade martian to cause a near panic another reason for scientist to expect life on Mars have to do with the apparent seasonal color change on the planet 's surface this phenomenon lead to speculation that condition might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warm month and cause plant life to become dormant during colder period so far six american mission to Mars have be carry out four Mariner spacecraft three fly by the planet and one place into martian orbit survey the planet extensively before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrive Mariner 4 launch in late 1964 fly past Mars on July 14 1965 come within 9,846 kilometer 6,118 mile of the surface transmit to Earth 22 close up picture of the planet the spacecraft find many crater and naturally occur channel but no evidence of artificial canal or flow water mariner 6 and 7 follow with their flyby during the summer of 1969 and return 201 picture mariner 4 6 and 7 show a diversity of surface condition as well as a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide on May 30 1971 the Mariner 9 Orbiter be launch on a mission to make a year long study of the martian surface the spacecraft arrive five and a half month after lift off only to find Mars in the midst of a planet wide dust storm that make surface photography impossible for several week but after the storm clear Mariner 9 begin return the first of 7,329 pictures- these reveal previously unknown martian feature include evidence that large amount of water once flow across the surface etch river valley and flood plain in August and September 1975 the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft each consist of an orbiter and a lander lift off from Kennedy Space Center the mission be design to answer several question about the red planet include be there life there nobody expect the spacecraft to spot martian city but it be hope that the biology experiment on the Viking Landers would at least find evidence of primitive life past or present Viking Lander 1 become the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it land on July 20 1976 while the United States be celebrate its Bicentennial photo send back from the Chryse Planitia Plains of Gold show a bleak rusty red landscape panoramic image return by the lander reveal a rolling plain litter with rock and mark by ripple sand dune fine red dust from the martian soil give the sky a salmon hue when Viking Lander 2 touch down on Utopia Planitia on September 3 1976 it view a more rolling landscape than the one see by its predecessor one without visible dune the result send back by the laboratory on each Viking Lander be inconclusive small sample of the red martian soil be test in three different experiment design to detect biological process while some of the test result seem to indicate biological activity later analysis confirm that this activity be inorganic in nature and relate to the planet 's soil chemistry be there life on Mars no one know for sure but the viking mission find no evidence that organic molecule exist there the Viking Landers become weather station record wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure few weather change be observe the high temperature record by either craft be -14 degree celsius 7 degree Fahrenheit at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer the low temperature -120 degree Celsius -184 degree Fahrenheit be record at the more northerly Viking Lander 2 site during winter near hurricane wind speed be measure at the two martian weather station during global dust storm but because the atmosphere be so thin wind force be minimal Viking Lander 2 photograph light patch of frost probably water ice during its second winter on the planet the martian atmosphere like that of Venus be primarily carbon dioxide Nitrogen and oxygen be present only in small percentage martian air contain only about 11,000 as much water as our air but even this small amount can condense out form cloud that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slope of tower volcano local patch of early morning fog can form in valley there be evidence that in the past a dense martian atmosphere may have allow water to flow on the planet physical feature closely resemble shoreline gorge riverbed and island suggest that great river once mark the planet Mars have two moon Phobos and Deimos they be small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient cratered surface it be possible the moon be originally asteroid that venture too close to Mars and be capture by its gravity the Viking Orbiters and Landers exceed by large margin their design lifetime of 120 and 90 day respectively the first to fail be Viking Orbiter 2 which stop operate on July 24 1978 when a leak deplete its attitude control gas Viking Lander 2 operate until April 12 1980 when it be shut down because of battery degeneration vike Orbiter 1 quit on August 7 1980 when the last of its attitude control gas be use up Viking Lander 1 cease function on November 13 1983 despite the inconclusive result of the vike biology experiment we know more about Mars than any other planet except Earth NASA 's Mars Observer spacecraft to be launch in September 1992 will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet Asteroids the solar system have a large number of rocky and metallic object that be in orbit around the Sun but be too small to be consider full fledge planet these object be know as asteroid or minor planet Most but not all be find in a band or belt between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter some have orbit that cross Earth 's path and there be evidence that Earth have be hit by asteroid in the past one of the least erode well preserve example be the Barringer Meteor Crater near Winslow Arizona asteroid be material leave over from the formation of the solar system one theory suggest that they be the remain of a planet that be destroy in a massive collision long ago more likely asteroid be material that never coalesce into a planet in fact if the estimate total mass of all asteroid be gather into a single object the object would be only about 1,500 kilometer 932 mile across less than half the diameter of our Moon thousand of asteroid have be identify from Earth it be estimate that 100,000 be bright enough to eventually be photograph through earth base telescope much of our understanding about asteroid come from examine piece of space debris that fall to the surface of Earth asteroid that be on a collision course with Earth be call meteoroid when a meteoroid strike our atmosphere at high velocity friction cause this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light know as a meteor if the meteoroid do not burn up completely what 's left strike Earth 's surface and be call a meteorite one of the good place to look for meteorite be the ice cap of Antarctica of all the meteorite examine 92.8 percent be compose of silicate stone and 5.7 percent be compose of iron and nickel- the rest be a mixture of the three material Stony meteorite be the hard to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rock since asteroid be material from the very early solar system scientist be interested in their composition Spacecraft that have fly through the asteroid belt have find that the belt be really quite empty and that asteroid be separate by very large distance current and future mission will fly by select asteroid for close examination the Galileo Orbiter launch by NASA in October 1989 will investigate main belt asteroid on its way to Jupiter the Comet Rendezvous   Asteroid Flyby CRAF and Cassini mission will also study these far flung object schedule for launch in the latter part of the 1990 the CRAF and Cassini mission be a collaborative project of NASA the European Space Agency and the federal space agency of Germany and Italy as well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy one day space factory will mine the asteroid for raw material Jupiter beyond Mars and the asteroid belt in the outer region of our solar system lie the giant planet of Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune in 1972 NASA dispatch the first of four spacecraft slate to conduct the initial survey of these colossal world of gas and their moon of ice and rock Jupiter be the first port of call Pioneer 10 which lift off from Kennedy Space Center in March 1972 be the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer region of the solar system in December 1973 it return the first close up image of Jupiter fly within 132,252 kilometer 82,178 mile of the planet 's banded cloud top Pioneer 11 follow a year later voyager 1 and 2 be launch in the summer of 1977 and return spectacular photograph of Jupiter and its family of satellite during flyby in 1979 these traveler find Jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium top with a colorful atmosphere compose mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium ammonia ice crystal form white jovian cloud Sulfur compound and perhaps phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hue that characterize Jupiter 's atmosphere it be likely that methane ammonia water and other gas react to form organic molecule in the region between the planet 's frigid cloud top and the warm hydrogen ocean lie below because of Jupiter 's atmospheric dynamic however these organic compound if they exist be probably short lived the Great Red Spot have be observe for century through telescope on Earth this hurricane like storm in Jupiter 's atmosphere be more than twice the size of our planet as a high pressure region the Great Red Spot spin in a direction opposite to that of low pressure storm on Jupiter- it be surround by swirl current that rotate around the spot and be sometimes consume by it the Great Red Spot might be a million year old our spacecraft detect lightning in Jupiter 's upper atmosphere and observe auroral emission similar to Earth 's northern light at the jovian polar region Voyager 1 return the first image of a faint narrow ring encircle Jupiter Largest of the solar system 's planet Jupiter rotate at a dizzying pace once every 9 hour 55 minute 30 second the massive planet take almost 12 Earth year to complete a journey around the Sun with 16 know moon Jupiter be something of a miniature solar system a new mission to Jupiter the Galileo Project be under way after a six- year cruise that take the Galileo Orbiter once past Venus twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two asteroid the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into Jupiter 's cloud layer and relay datum back to Earth the Galileo Orbiter will spend two year circle the planet and fly close to Jupiter 's large moon explore in detail what the two Pioneers and two voyager reveal Galilean Satellites in 1610 Galileo Galilei aim his telescope at Jupiter and spot four point of light orbit the planet for the first time human have see the moon of another world in honor of their discoverer these four body would become know as the Galilean satellite or moon but Galileo might have happily trade this honor for one look at the dazzle photograph return by the Voyager spacecraft as they fly past these planet sized satellite one of the most remarkable finding of the Voyager mission be the presence of active volcano on the Galilean moon Io volcanic eruption have never before be observe on a world other than Earth the Voyager camera identify at least nine active volcano on Io with plume of eject material extend as far as 280 kilometer 175 mile above the moon 's surface Io 's pizza color terrain mark by orange and yellow hue be probably the result of sulfur rich material bring to the surface by volcanic activity volcanic activity on this satellite be the result of tidal flexing cause by the gravitational tug of war between Io Jupiter and the other three Galilean moon Europa approximately the same size as our Moon be the bright Galilean satellite the moon 's surface display a complex array of streak indicate the crust have be fracture catch in a gravitational tug of war like Io Europa have be heat enough to cause its interior ice to melt apparently produce a liquid water ocean this ocean be cover by an ice crust that have form where water be expose to the cold of space Europa 's core be make of rock that sink to its center like Europa the other two galilean moon Ganymede and Callisto be world of ice and rock Ganymede be the large satellite in the solar system large than the planet Mercury and Pluto the satellite be compose of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock Ganymede 's surface have area of different brightness indicate that in the past material ooze out of the moon 's interior and be deposit at various location on the surface Callisto only slightly small than Ganymede have the low density of any Galilean satellite suggest that large amount of water be part of its composition Callisto be the most heavily cratere object in the solar system- no activity during its history have erase old crater except more impact detailed study of all the Galilean satellite will be perform by the Galileo Orbiter Saturn no planet in the solar system be adorn like Saturn its exquisite ring system be unrivale like Jupiter Saturn be compose mostly of hydrogen but in contrast to the vivid color and wild turbulence find in jovian cloud Saturn 's atmosphere have a more subtle butterscotch hue and its marking be mute by high altitude haze give Saturn 's somewhat placid look appearance scientist be surprise at the high velocity equatorial jet stream that blow some 1,770 kilometer 1,100 mile per hour three american spacecraft have visit Saturn Pioneer 11 speed by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979 return the first close up image Voyager 1 follow in November 1980 send back breathtake photograph that reveal for the first time the complexity of Saturn 's ring system and moon Voyager 2 fly by the planet and its moon in August 1981 the ring be compose of countless low density particle orbit individually around Saturn 's equator at progressive distance from the cloud top analysis of spacecraft radio wave pass through the ring show that the particle vary widely in size range from dust to house sized boulder the ring be bright because they be mostly ice and frosted rock the ring might have result when a moon or a pass body venture too close to Saturn the unlucky object would have be tear apart by great tidal force on its surface and in its interior or the object may not have be fully form to begin with and disintegrate under the influence of Saturn 's gravity a third possibility be that the object be shatter by collision with large object orbit the planet unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particle appear to be hold in place by the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellite these complex gravitational interaction form the thousand of ringlet that make up the major ring radio emission quite similar to the static hear on an AM car radio during an electrical storm be detect by the Voyager spacecraft these emission be typical of lightning but be believe to be come from Saturn 's ring system rather than its atmosphere where no lightning be observe as they have at Jupiter the Voyagers see a version of Earth 's aurora near Saturn 's pole the Voyagers discover new moon and find several satellite that share the same orbit we learn that some moon shepherd ring particle maintain Saturn 's ring and the gap in the ring Saturn 's 18th moon be discover in 1990 from image take by Voyager 2 in 1981 Voyager 1 determine that Titan have a nitrogen base atmosphere with methane and argon one more like Earth be in composition than the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Mars and Venus Titan 's surface temperature of -179 degree Celsius -290 degree Fahrenheit imply that there might be water ice island rise above ocean of ethane methane liquid or sludge unfortunately Voyager 's camera could not penetrate the moon 's dense cloud continue photochemistry from solar radiation may be convert Titan 's methane to ethane acetylene and in combination with nitrogen hydrogen cyanide the latter compound be a building block of amino acid these condition may be similar to the atmospheric condition of primeval Earth between three and four billion year ago however Titan 's atmospheric temperature be believe to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry the exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini mission the Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe call Huygens which will be drop into Titan 's atmosphere and fall to the surface Cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through Titan 's cloud and will spend year examine the saturnian system Uranus in January 1986 four and a half year after visit Saturn Voyager 2 complete the first close up survey of the uranian system the brief flyby reveal more information about Uranus and its retinue of icy moon than have be glean from ground observation since the planet 's discovery over two century ago by the english astronomer William Herschel Uranus third large of the planet be an oddball of the solar system unlike the other planet with the exception of Pluto this giant lie tip on its side with its north and south pole alternately face the sun during an 84 year swing around the solar system during Voyager 2 's flyby the south pole face the Sun uranus might have be knock over when an earth sized object collide with it early in the life of the solar system Voyager 2 find that Uranus magnetic field do not follow the usual north south axis find on the other planet instead the field be tilt 60 degree and offset from the planet 's center a phenomenon that on Earth would be like have one magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of Djakarta on the island of Java in Indonesia Uranus atmosphere consist mainly of hydrogen with some 12 percent helium and small amount of ammonia methane and water vapor the planet 's blue color occur because methane in its atmosphere absorb all other color wind speed range up to 580 kilometer 360 mile per hour and temperature near the cloud top average -221 degree celsius -366 degree Fahrenheit Uranus sunlit south pole be shroud in a kind of photochemical smog believe to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlight generate chemical surround the planet 's atmosphere and extend thousand of kilometer into space be a mysterious ultraviolet sheen know as electroglow approximately 8,000 kilometer 5,000 mile below Uranus cloud top there be think to be a scald ocean of water and dissolve ammonia some 10,000 kilometer 6,200 mile deep beneath this ocean be an earth sized core of heavy material Voyager 2 discover 10 new moon 16 169 kilometer 10 105 mile in diameter orbit Uranus the five previously know Miranda Ariel Umbriel Titania and Oberon range in size from 520 to 1,610 kilometer 323 to 1,000 mile across represent a geological showcase these five moon be half ice half rock sphere that be cold and dark and show evidence of past activity include fault and ice flow the most remarkable of Uranus moon be Miranda its surface feature high cliff as well as canyon crater pock plain and wind valley the sharp variation in terrain suggest that after the moon form it be smash apart by a collision with another body an event not unusual in our solar system which contain many object that have impact crater or be fragment from large impact what be extraordinary be that Miranda apparently reform with some of the material that have be in its interior expose on its surface Uranus be think to have nine dark rings- Voyager 2 image 11 in contrast to Saturn 's ring which be compose of bright particle Uranus ring be primarily make up of dark boulder sized chunk Neptune Voyager 2 complete its 12 year tour of the solar system with an investigation of Neptune and the planet 's moon on August 25 1989 the spacecraft sweep to within 4,850 kilometer 3,010 mile of Neptune and then fly on to the moon Triton during the Neptune encounter it become clear that the planet 's atmosphere be more active than Uranus Voyager 2 observe the Great Dark Spot a circular storm the size of Earth in Neptune 's atmosphere resemble jupiter 's Great Red Spot the storm spin counterclockwise and move westward at almost 1,200 kilometer 745 mile per hour Voyager 2 also note a small dark spot and a fast move cloud dub the Scooter as well as high altitude cloud over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the high wind speed of any planet be observe up to 2,400 kilometer 1,500 mile per hour like the other giant planet Neptune have a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planet 's core contain a high percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giant Neptune 's distinctive blue appearance like Uranus blue color be due to atmospheric methane Neptune 's magnetic field be tilt relative to the planet 's spin axis and be not center at the core this phenomenon be similar to Uranus magnetic field and suggest that the field of the two giant be be generate in an area above the core where the pressure be so great that liquid hydrogen assume the electrical property of a metal Earth 's magnetic field on the other hand be produce by its spin metallic core and be only slightly tilt and offset relative to its center Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune 's ring observation from Earth indicate that there be arc of material in orbit around the giant planet it be not clear how Neptune could have arc and how these could be keep from spread out into even unclumped ring Voyager 2 detect these arc but they be in fact part of thin complete ring a number of small moon could explain the arc but such body be not spot astronomer have identify the neptunian moon Triton in 1846 and Nereid in 1949 Voyager 2 find six more one of the new moon proteus be actually large than Nereid but since Proteus orbit close to Neptune it be lose in the planet 's glare for observer on Earth Triton circle Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six day tidal force on Triton be cause it to spiral slowly towards the planet in 10 to 100 million year a short time in astronomical term the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart form a spectacular ring to accompany the planet 's modest current ring Triton 's landscape be as strange and unexpected as those of Io and Miranda the moon have more rock than its counterpart at Saturn and Uranus Triton 's mantle be probably compose of water ice but the moon 's crust be a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane the moon show two dramatically different type of terrain the so call cantaloupe terrain and a recede ice cap Dark streak appear on the ice cap these streak be the fallout from geyser like volcanic vent that shoot nitrogen gas and dark fine grain particle to height of 2 to 8 kilometer 1 to 5 mile Triton 's thin atmosphere only 170,000th as thick as Earth 's have wind that carry the dark particle and deposit they as streak on the ice cap the cold surface yet find in the solar system -235 degree Celsius -391 degree Fahrenheit Triton might be more like Pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visit Pluto Pluto be the most distant of the planet yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carry it inside Neptune 's orbit where it have be since 1979 and where it will remain until March 1999 Pluto 's orbit be also highly inclined tilt 17 degree to the orbital plane of the other planet discover in 1930 Pluto appear to be little more than a celestial snowball the planet 's diameter be calculate to be approximately 2,300 kilometer 1,430 mile only two third the size of our Moon ground base observation indicate that Pluto 's surface be cover with methane ice and that there be a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet move away from the Sun observation also show that Pluto 's spin axis be tip by 122 degree the planet have one know satellite Charon discover in 1978 Charon 's surface composition be different from Pluto 's the moon appear to be cover with water ice rather than methane ice its orbit be gravitationally lock with Pluto so both body always keep the same hemisphere face each other Pluto 's and Charon 's rotational period and Charon 's period of revolution be all 6.4 Earth day although no spacecraft have ever visit Pluto NASA be currently explore the possibility of such a mission comet the outermost member of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planet as asteroid be the rocky and metallic remnant of the formation of the solar system comet be the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the Sun Most comet nucleus reside in the Oort Cloud a loose swarm of object in a halo beyond the planet and reach perhaps halfway to the near star Comet nucleus orbit in this frozen abyss until they be gravitationally perturb into new orbit that carry they close to the Sun as a nucleus fall inside the orbit of the outer planet the volatile element of which it be make gradually warm- by the time the nucleus enter the region of the inner planet these volatile element be boil the nucleus itself be irregular and only a few mile across and be make principally of water ice with methane and ammonia material very similar to those compose the moon of the giant planet as these material boil off of the nucleus they form a coma or cloud like head that can measure ten of thousand of kilometer across the coma grow as the comet get close to the Sun the stream of charge particle come from the Sun push on this cloud blow it back like a flag in the wind and give rise to the comet 's tail gas and ion be blow directly back from the nucleus but dust particle be push more slowly as the nucleus continue in its orbit the dust particle be leave behind in a curved arc both the gas and dust tail point away from the sun- in effect the comet chase its tail as it recede from the Sun the tail can reach 150 million kilometer 93 million mile in length but the total amount of material contain in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase comet from the latin cometa mean long haired be essentially dramatic light show some comet pass through the solar system only once but other have their orbit gravitationally modify by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planet these latter visitor can enter close elliptical orbit and repeatedly return to the inner solar system Halley 's Comet be the most famous example of a relatively short period comet return on an average of once every 76 year and orbit from beyond Neptune to within Venus orbit confirmed sighting of the comet go back to 240 B.C. this regular visitor to our solar system be name for Sir Edmond Halley because he plot the comet 's orbit and predict its return base on early sighting and newtonian law of motion his name become part of astronomical lore when in 1759 the comet return on schedule unfortunately Sir Edmond do not live to see it a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it pass comparatively close to Earth unfortunately on its most recent appearance Halley 's Comet pass no close than 62.4 million kilometer 38.8 million mile from our world the comet be visible to the naked eye especially for viewer in the southern hemisphere but it be not spectacular comet have be so bright on rare occasion that they be visible during daytime historically comet sighting have be interpret as bad omen and have be artistically render as dagger in the sky the Comet Rendezvous   Asteroid Flyby CRAF spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun CRAF will observe the nucleus as it become active in the grow sunlight and begin to have its light element boil off and form a coma and tail several spacecraft have fly by comet at high speed- the first be NASA 's International Cometary Explorer in 1985 an armada of five spacecraft two Japanese two Soviet and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency fly by Halley 's Comet in 1986 Conclusion despite their effort to peer across the vast distance of space through an obscure atmosphere scientist of the past have only one body they could study closely Earth but since 1959 spaceflight through the solar system have lift the veil on our neighbor in space we have learn more about our solar system and its member than anyone have in the previous thousand of year our automate spacecraft have travel to the Moon and to all the planet beyond our world except Pluto- they have observe moon as large as small planet fly by comet and sample the solar environment astronomy book now include detailed picture of body that be only smudge in the large telescope for generation we be lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful place and object the knowledge gain from our journey through the solar system have redefine traditional Earth science like geology and meteorology and spawn an entirely new discipline call comparative planetology by study the geology of planet moon asteroid and comet and compare difference and similarity we be learn more about the origin and history of these body and the solar system as a whole we be also gain insight into Earth 's complex weather system by see how weather be shape on other world and by investigate the Sun 's activity and its influence throughout the solar system we can well understand climatic condition and process on Earth we will continue to learn and benefit as our automate spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space one current mission be map Venus- other be fly between world and will reach the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustment future mission be plan for Mars Saturn a comet and the asteroid belt we can also look forward to the time when human will once again set foot on an alien world although astronaut have not be back to the Moon since December 1972 plan be be formulate for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian outpost one day take a holiday may mean spend a week at a lunar base or a martian colony;2
116;it should be note that the US benefit not only from german science and technology after WW2 but also from british science and technology from the discovery and manufacture of penicillin to jet engine swing wing aircraft the hovercraft etc etc all be ship lock stick and barel across the Atlantic we still be suffer from this sort of thing because of some of the more parochial aspect of US procurement policy Meiko a british parallel computer company for example have now move most of its facility to the US since that be the only way it could sell stuff over there;2

122;no Dave and as an anthropologist I take great umbrage with this misrepresentation I sense that it be you that have make the jump from creation science to religion see above I have characterize sciencecreation science   as rationalism   nonsense and that it be when people promote their religious belief as science they become nonsense Kept where they belong they be meaningful and useful as virtually any anthropologist will tell you and as I have say several time in this group and it work the other way too and I have repeatedly say so never have I say or mean anything different here or elsewhere and I do n't think my communication skill betray I nor do I presume to offend people 's spiritual sensibility as I would hope other would not disparage mine;3
123;when they 're not important yes all scientist do otherwise science would never get anywhere hang about not atomic interaction in general just specific one which be deem unimportant like gravitational interaction between ion which be so small they 're drown out by electrostatic effect and so on oh probably they still make people memorize equation and IR spectra maybe in a few decade they 'll discover the revolutionary data book technique;0
124;but if he   she do you would probably consider it rape obviously there be many Christians who have try and do believe so no one ask you to swallow everything in fact Jesus warn against it but let I ask you a question do you beleive what you learn in history class or for that matter anything in school I mean it 's just what other people have tell you and you do n't want to swallow what other say right the life death and resurection of Christ be document historical fact as much as anything else you learn how do you choose what to believe and what not to I could argue that George Washington be a myth he never live because I do n't have any proof except what I be tell however all the major event of the life of Jesus Christ be fortold hundred of year before he neat trick uh;0
125;  edit   well for starter why use rle file you might have a specific program that need they ok but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format thus a 2.4meg 24bit targa file become a 80k or less 24bit jpeg the late version of XV 2.2.1 and xloadimage 3.03 both handle jpeg file and the good way to convert to jpeg be with the c   djpeg suit even at 90 quality you ca n't see the difference the jpeg be way small than anything else even an 8bit gif later'ish Craig;1

143;as oppose to Universal or Catholic or FourSquare Gosple I think that the Greek Orthodox Church would take high offense at your misuse of the word your version of Christianity be neither mainstream nor bible derive you make claim of bible centricity that be not derivable soley from the Bible about six seven month ago you claim that your primary objection to the LDS be that our doctrine be not bible derive and now this and other claim can be show be also not bible interpete bible tsimple truth oh for example paradise exalt to heaven tparadise was n't equal to heaven and   now   it be yet you claim that tpeeple can not be exalt to heaven nicht wahr tWhen I read the story I find that Abraham 's Bosom was n't so much ta place but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to Abraham tgee this be fairly close to what the LDS call spirit prison and what you have call false doctrine   ver delete reproduce below quote from the SunSpot Gopher Archive   this part be   not   support from scripture nor do it support your claim that the paradise where Christ descend be exalt make such claim on this little evidence ignore the witness of the scripture use this to argue that paradise or spirit prison be now change from a pre easter postion to post easter by God postion be not supportable make such a claim require more evidence than you have give here yes and your reason be in general not support by any direct reading of the scripture you have demonstrate that you claim to scriptural proof need to be cross checked the referenc that you supply often do not support your postion if they be read in the context of the scripture tHow about that those who have be in paradise and have accept tthe gosple will be judge of Jesus Christ and then return to the tpresence of God be that somehow different from your expressed view tthat the paradise speak of or Abraham 's Bosom tshould we go back and discuss your view on why the Angle of the Lord tis the Lord again;3

159;    I think you 're let atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of WEBSTER myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth be accept uncritically how do that qualify indeed it 's almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance I 've find that most atheist hold almost no atheist view as accept uncritically especially the few that be legend many be try to explain basic truth as myth do but they do n't meet the other criterion Andrew the myth to which I refer be the convoluted counterfeit athiest have create to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion include Christainity in a rational manner and debate its claim -as the be stated- atheist concoct outrageous parody and then hold the religious accountable for belief they do n't have what be more accurately oxymoric be the a term like reasonable atheist Bill   divine justice accord to the most fundamental doctrine of   Christianity when the first man sin he be at that time the you accuse he of reference mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meet all the requirement of myth Here be a good example of of what I say above read the post again I say acoorde to which mean I be refer to christian doctrine as I understand it if I be speak for myself you 'll know it my purpose in posting be to present a basic overview of Christain doctrine since it seem germane Bill   with those who pretend not to know what be be say and what it   mean when atheist claim that they do -not- know if God exist and   do n't know what he want they contradict the Bible which clearly say   that -everyone- know the authority of the Bible be its claim to be should I repeat what I write above for the sake of get it across you may trust the Bible but your trust it does n't make it any more credible to I if the Bible say that everyone know that 's clearly reason to doubt the Bible because not everyone know your alleged god 's allege existance again I be paraphrase christian doctrine which be very clear on this point your dispute be not with I Bill   refute while the species wide condemnation be justify those that   claim that there be no evidence for the existence of God or that his will be   unknown must deliberately ignore the Bible- the ignorance itself be   no excuse 1 no they do n't have to ignore the Bible the Bible be far from universally accept the Bible be not a proof of god- it be only a proof that some people have think that there be a god or do it prove even that they might have be write it as series of fiction short story as in the case of Dionetics assume the writer believe it the only thing it could possibly prove be that they believe it and that be ignore the problem of whether or not all the interpretation and Biblical philosopher be correct 2 there be people who have truly never hear of the Bible 3 again read the FAQ 1 here again you miss the point the Bible itself be not the point it 's what it contain it make no difference who accpet the Bible or even who 's unaware of its existence Christians hold that it apply universally because mankind share the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of God 2 see above 3 if you read my post with same care as read the FAQ we would n't be have this conversation Bill   freedom you be free to ignore God in the same way you be free to   ignore gravity and the consequence be inevitable and well know   in both case that an atheist ca n't accept the evidence mean only Bzzt wrong answer gravity be directly there it does n't stop exert a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it God on the other hand does n't generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloid God does n't exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity be obvious- god are n't as I say the evidence be there you just do n't accept it here at least we agree Bill   secondly human reason be very comforatble with the concept of God so   much so that it be in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason   always come back to the question of God in every generation and in no human reason has n't always come back to the existance of god- it have usually come back to the existance of god in other word it does n't generally come back to the xtian god it come back to whether there be any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally does n't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural force be and which one be out there from a world wide view human nature just make we wonder how the universe come to be andor what force(s be currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in God only exist in religious wishful think yes human reason do always come back to the existence of God we 're have this discussion be we not Bill   I say all this to make the point that Christianity be eminently   reasonable that Divine justice be just and human nature be much   different than what atheist think it be whether you agree or not you certainly be not correct on human nature you be at the least base your view on a completely eurocentric approach try look at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity well this be interesting Truth be to be determine by it politically correct content grant it 's extremely unhip to be a WASP male and anything european be contemptable but I think this kind of dialogue the purpose of a.a be to get at the truth of thing but then I remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and I understand;0

182;of course not I would think that would be great   fun   not having ever feel the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze this be not what I get when I believe I just try to hide my fear of getting punish for something I never be sure of the Bible be hopelessly confusing for someone who want to know for sure God do not answer in the end I find I have be follow a mass delusion a lie I ca n't believe in a being who refuse to give a slight hint of her existence I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reason why they believe and analyse their position in fact it be amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publication tell we exactly the opposite one should not examine one 's belief critically I 'll tell you something I leave out of my testimony I post to this group two month ago a day after I finally find out my faith be over I decide to try just one more time the same cycle of emotional response fire once again but this time the delusion last only a couple of hour I tell my friend in a phone that it really work thank god just to think about it again when I hang up I have to admit that I have lie and fall prey to the same illusion I use to believe what I read in book when I be young or what other people tell I but I grow more and more skeptical the more I read I learn what it mean to use   reason   as a student of chemistry I have to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compound in the lab I   hate   experiment like this they be old fashioned and increase the student 's workload considerably besides I have to do it twice since I fail in my first attempt however I think I 'll never forget the lesson no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown be X it may still be Y. it be   very   tempting to jump into conclusion take a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the datum which be inconsistent but it can still be wrong I find out that I be after all use exactly the same mechanism to believe in god mental self assurance suspension of fear filtering of information in other word it be only I no god play any part oh and I have well believe this Dan many UFO story be much well document than the resurrection of Jesus the resurrection be document quite haphazardly in the Bible it seem the author do not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out besides the end of the gospel probably contain late addition and insertions- for instance the end of Mark 16:9 20 be miss from many early text say my Bible Jesus may have live and die but he be probably misunderstood this be easy I believe that the world exist independent of my mind and that logic and reason can be use to interpret and analyse what I observe nothing else need to be take on faith I will go by the evidence it make no difference whether I believe George Washington exist or not I assume that he do consider the vast amount of evidence present a liar how do you know what my attitude be try read your Bible again I be willing to die for my faith those who do be usually remember as hero at least among those who believe Dan do you think I 'm lie when I say I believe firmly for 15 year it seem it be very difficult to admit that someone who have really believe do not do so anymore but I ca n't go on lie to myself blind trust be dangerous and I be just another blind lead by the blind but if god really want I she 'll know what to do i 'm willing I just do n't know whether she exists look at the available evidence it look like she does n't Petri;0

212;sci.space reader can skip the first paragraph yesterday in response to Henry Spencer 's question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space I say Dust grain act as blackbody and they 're at 40 150 K. well I be dead wrong our local interstellar dust expert Bruce Draine have inform I that dust grain   are n't   good radiator in the far IR which be why they be so warm- actually the ambient radiation field from distant star can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin Sorry Henry and anyone else I mislead obviously time for I to take another ISM class in other news Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute give a talk on the Pluto Charon binary system yesterday he give a brief overview of the currently accept system parameter volume ratio of about 8:1 mass ratio about 15:1 or so plus lot more and then give his thought on the formation of Pluto Charon his idea be that there be lot and lot of small planetesimal in the outer solar system with masse distribute as a power law of some kind- over time the planetesimal accrete into large body Most get scatter out of the solar system by close encounter with Jupiter and Saturn but many accrete into the gas giant especially Uranus and Neptune a large planetesimal be capture by Neptune we call it Triton   capture how perhaps by a collision with a small already exist neptunian moon perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune 's atmosphere mondo aerobraking   he note that the two recently discover Kuiper Belt object 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW plus Chiron and Pholus be all about the same mass and he identify this group as one accretion down from the large body of Triton and Pluto   Charon Pluto   Charon he think form when an impact body hit proto Pluto knock some material into a ring around Pluto which later accrete in Charon- similar to idea about the formation of Earth 's moon there be good evidence from spectra that the surface of Pluto and Charon be very different Pluto have methane frost Charon does n't which can be use as evidence for the impact theory he believe that there may be around 1000 Pluto to chiron sized object remain in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune 's orbit beyond 35 AU or so 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW be the first member of this population to be find in his model note that such body will be very dark since if their surface be cover with methane frost it will have photolyze into very dark long chain hydrocarbon by now the reason that Pluto have such a high albedo around 0.5 I think be that its surface warm up just enough around perihelion to sublimate and when the atmosphere freeze out again thirty year later it form bright new frost so any body much far away than 30 AU be go to be very hard to see I hope I have n't make any error in the transcription- if you see a howl mistake it 's undoubtedly mine not his by the way he 's one of the top gun behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission I think and say that the current plan be to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory to Pluto we be speak loosely at the time he 'd like to use a Proton which give a slightly small velocity but cost MUCH less his figure   500 million for 2 Titan 4 launch there will be two separate probe launch separately or   120 million for 2 Proton launch he tell a story about how the Soviets originally offer to sell Proton launch for   30 million each but be force to increase their price in the US in order to be allow in the marketplace I 'm just tell you what he say Michael;2

260;ok with all the discussion about observed playback speed with QuickTime the effect of scale and so on I think i 'd do some more test first of all I feel that my original speed test be perhaps less than realistic the movie I have be use only have 18 frame in it it be a version of the very first movie I create with the Compact Video compressor I decide something a little long would give close to real world result for well or for bad I pull out a copy of 2001 a Space Odyssey that I have record off tv a while back about fifteen minute into the movie there 's a sequence where the Earth shuttle be approach the space station specifically I digitize a portion of about 30 seconds duration zoom in on the rotate space station I figure this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frame to increase the difference between frame I digitize it at only 5 frame per second to give a total of 171 frame I capture the raw footage at a resolution of 384   288 pixel with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 quarter size resolution from a pal source I then import it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor keep the 5 fps frame rate I create two version of the movie one scale to 320   240 resolution the other at 160   120 resolution I use the default 2.00 quality set in Premiere 2.0.1 and specify a key frame every ten frame I then run the 320   240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I use for the result I 'd be report early result a playback rate of over 45 frame per second That 's right I be get a much high result than with that first short test movie just for fun I copy the 320   240 movie to my external hard disk a Quantum lp105s and run it from there this time the playback rate be only about 35 frame per second obviously the 230 mb internal hard disk also a Quantum be a significant contributor to the speed of playback I modify my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factor and try play back the 160   120 movie scale to 320   240 size this time the playback speed be over 60 fps clearly the poster who observe poor performance on scale playback be see QuickTime 1.0 in action not 1.5 i 'd try my test with QuickTime 1.0 but I do n't think it 's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1 unscale the playback rate for the 160   120 movie be over 100 fps the other thing I try be save version of the 320   240 movie with preferred playback rate great than 1.0 and see how well they play from within MoviePlayer ie with QuickTime 's normal synchronize playback a preferred rate of 9.0   45 fps did n't work too well the playback be very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieve 45 fps with ease I ca n't believe that QuickTime 's synchronization code would add this much overhead I think the slowdown be come from the Mac system 's task switching a preferred rate of 7.0   35 fps seem to work fine I could n't see any evidence of stutter at 8.0   40 fps I   think   I could see slight stutter but with four key frame every second it be hard to tell I guess I could try recreate the movie with a long interval between the key frame to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more;1
261;  stuff delete   as many poster have say in as many post lately this be just not true for to show no interest in the existence of god take no faith at all you make the presumption that the   knowledge   of the   possibility   of something be enough to require faith to render that possibilty of no interest it be a very different thing to say that you do n't believe something than it be to say that you do n't have sufficent reason to believe something be even interesting to think about It 's not either or sometimes be just something else more interesting that occupy your mind I agree that faith and dogma be inevitable but not necessarily apply to god and religion it take both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning but there be overwhelming reason every single day day in and day out for   everyone   to put his faith and dogma there not so with the christian religion;0

265;Interstellar grain be not at all close to blackbody the large grain have size of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency however at temperature below 100 K 90 of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 micron where radiate efficiency be poor a small antenna can not easily radiate at long wavelength thus the grain must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorb moreover the IRAS observation have a maximum wavelength of 100 micron grain cold than 30 k will radiate primarily at long wavelength and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to they in the extreme limit grain as cold as 5 k will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation worse still IRAS color temperature be heavily contaminate by a population of small grain these grain have only perhaps 50 atom and when they be hit by a single photon they heat up to temperature of several hundred or 1000 K. of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but   when they be radiate   the characteristic temperature be several hundred K. even a small population of these grain can dramatically raise the observed average temperature a model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe datum have three component these represent scatter radiation from zodiacal dust color temperature 5500 K thermal emission from zodiacal dust Tc   280 K and thermal emission from galactic dust Tc25 K at the ecliptic pole the emissivitie or dilution factor be respectively 1.9e-13 4e-8 and 2e-5 the first two be roughly double in the ecliptic plane to find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all component then take the fourth root in the table below starlight come from Allen 's number that stellar emission from the whole sky be equivalent to 460 zero mag star with b v color of 0.75 no doubt careful work could do much well the person who suggest starlight have a dilution factor of E-4 must have be remember wrong we would be cook if that be the case in any event the energy density of starlight come out about the same as that of the microwave background and I believe that to be correct Dilution Temp DT4 Microwave background 1 2.7 53 galactic dust 2e-5 25 8 zodiacal dust emission 6E-8 280 369 Zodiacal dust scatter 3e-13 5500 275 Starlight 1e-13 5500 92 797 the fourth root of 797 be 5.3 K. outside the Solar system the result would be 3.5 k.

266;some people might think it take faith to be an atheist but faith in what do it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn do not exist do it take some kind of faith to say that Santa Claus do not exist if it do and it may for some people I suppose it certainly is n't as big a leap of faith to say that these thing and god do exist I suppose it depend on your notion and definition of faith besides not believe in a god mean one does n't have to deal with all of the extra baggage that come with it this leave a person feel wonderfully free especially after beat over the head with it for year I agree that religion and belief be often an important psychological healer for many people and for that reason I think it 's important however try to force a psychological fantasy I do n't mean that in a bad way but that be what it really be on someone else who is n't interested be extremely rude what if I still believe in Santa Claus and say that my belief in Santa do wonderful thing for my life make I a well person allow I to live without guilt etc and then try to get you to believe in Santa too just 'cuz he do so much for I You 'd call the man in white coat as soon as you could get to a phone;0

good luck then you lie to yourself you do not know your shortcoming I have clearly show one of your shortcoming if not two that is ignorance of the Bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butcher it without even know its content because you have be too prideful to examine the record of he for yourself and to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion I bet you do not even know what the word Christ mean or which prophet use Christ to describe the Son of Man yes I agree with that so we must learn first read the Bible come up with our own interpretation evaluate what be be say and by whom check the history book as well compare someone else 's interpretation with your own then make a judgment but I tell you the truth 99 of what be be say in the Bible need interpretation as much as a coffee cup need interpretation and remember the Bible is n't a Guru 's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics it does n't take a theologian to understand what be be say the Bible be a bunch of testimony from people like you and I address to people like you and I. these guy write down what they see and hear be it their open diary and they want to tell you something and because they want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to know they did n't encouch their idea in esoteric rhetoric but in simple straight forward language you have choose the road that avoid the Bible you have choose the road that avoid a confrontation with the live God because that road does n't look appeal to you you rather build your own road one that go far away from that confrontation but be assure of this you will have to confront he one day willingly or unwillingly I see what you mean I hear what your say I be not degrade your life but I have hear the same irrational excuse for year there be nothing new in what you be say and by your own word you be spout off contradiction if contradiction give you meaning then your life must be sad Bingo for God so love the world he give his only begotton to son so that whososever belive in he will have ever last life I look what God   do   he have give his Son even to his death so that I can have hope in his resurrection and know that life is n't for nothing but have glorious purpose because you turn your eye away from testimony and history you choose to lie to yourself that he does n't exist for you ignore what have be say for thousand of year you sound exactly almost verbatim like the Lazarus of Jesus 's story start in Luke 16:19 and the conclusion of that story be a bleak one Lazarus wind up in hell the story end like this for if Lazarus does n't even listen to Moses and the Prophets he wo n't even believe if a man rise from the dead Arrogance at its good the fact be you be not rational several specific case have already be cite and again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regard to heaven Jesus do tell you something of what to expect in heaven Jesus expect you to use your brain to believe in he Jesus do not expect you to placate either Jesus want you to willingly come to he but not as his grovel slave but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious rich why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself you maintain you have an open mind see whether you be lie to yourself for yourself I do understand what you say but that 's be not what I feel go amiss here you miss the point live a good life have no eternal consequence once they close the amusement park of life to you that be the end to you it be over to you therefore your time spend in the amusement park be meaningless it have no eternal consequence to you nor to anyone leave on earth but then you contradict yourself from a previous post you say do evil thing be bad to you it should n't matter if you do evil thing or good thing it be all meaningless in the end anyway so go rob a bank go tell someone you dislike that he be a dirty rotten slime bag What 's restrain you life after all have no eternal consequence and accountability be irrelevant at which time you be truly not the master of yourself so you and your holy book say by the same token therefore Santa Claus deliver toy every xmas do n't you see I have no reason to believe that what you say be true please give I some reason that I ca n't similarly apply to Santa Claus you have every reason to believe that what Jesus say and the

316;I get regular question about gamma correction since I go to great pain to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program I maintain here be an explanation I often use to answer these question this might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ tgraeme Gill                                                                             a note on gamma correction and image author Graeme W. Gill graemelabtam.oz.au date 93516 what be all this gamma stuff anyway although it would be nice to think that an image be an image there be a lot of complication not only be there a whole bunch of different image format gif jpeg tiff etc etc there be a whole lot of other technical stuff that make deal with image a bit complicated Gamma be one of those thing if you 've ever download image from BBS or the net you 've probably notice with most image viewing program that some image look ok some look too dark and some look too light why be this you may ask this be gamma correction or the lack of it why do we need gamma correction at all Gamma correction be need because of the nature of CRTs cathode ray tube the monitor usually use for view image if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measure the amount of light come from each point of the scene then you have create a linear or un gamma correct image this be a good thing in many way because you can manipulate the image as if the value in the image file be light ie add and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT you find that the CRT   does n't   give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light come from the phosphor in the screen depend on the the voltage something like this lightout   voltage   crtgamma so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first you need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image so that thing cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image gammacorrectedimage   image   1   crtgamma for most CRTs the crtgamma be somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0 if that be all it be why do it seem so complicated the problem be that not all display program do gamma correction also not all source of image give you linear image video camera or video signal in general because of this a lot of image already have some gamma correction do to they and you be rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those image with a program that do gamma correction for you the image get correct twice and look way to light if you display one of those image with a program that does n't do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction be not exactly right for you particular CRT whose fault be all this it be really three thing one be all those display program out there that do n't do gamma correction properly another be that most image format do n't specify a standard gamma or do n't have some way or record what their gamma correction be the third thing be that not many people understand what gamma correction be all about and create a lot of image with vary gamma 's at least two file format do the right thing the Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format have a semi standard way of record the gamma of an image the JFIF file standard that use JPEG compression specifie that the image to be encode must have a gamma of 1.0 ie a linear image but not everyone obey the rule some image loader for instance xli an X11 image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you be use but the individual gamma value of image you be try to view other image viewer eg xv another X11 image program and utility eg the pbm toolkit provide way of change the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allow for undo any gamma correction the image have and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor   note that xv 2.21 does n't provide an easy way of modify the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curve to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit control alter the intensity in the HSV control does n't do the right thing as it fail to take account of the effect gamma have on H and S. this tend to give a tint to the image   how can I figure out what my viewer do or what gamma my screen have the simple way to do that be to try load the file chkgamma.jpg provide with xli distribution which be a JFIF jpeg format file contain two grayscale ramp the ramp be choose to look linear to the human eye one use continuous tone and the other use dithering if your viewer do the right thing and gamma correct image then the two ramp should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it help if you move away a little from the screen and de focus your eye a bit if your viewer does n't do gamma correction then leave hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center if your viewer do have a way of set the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point be above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it be below the center the value will usually be around 2.2   with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag and once you 've get it right you can set the displaygamma environment variable in your .profile   how do I figure out what the gamma of an image be this be the most tricky bit as a general rule it seem that a lot of true color ie 24 bit .ppm .jpg image have a gamma of 1.0 linear although there be many about that have some gamma correction it seem that the majority of pseudo color image ie 8 bit image with color map .gif etc be gamma correct to some degree or other if your viewer do gamma correction then linear image will look good and gamma correct image will look too light if your viewer does n't do gamma correction then linear image will look too dark and gamma correct image will ok why Linear image be sometimes not such a good thing one of the reason that many high quality format such as Video use gamma correction be that it actually make well use of the storage medium this be because the human eye have a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction have a similar compression characteristic this mean image could make well use of 8 bit per color for instance if they use gamma correction the implication though be that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bit to retain the same accuracy since little popular software do this and none of the popular image format can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it be difficult to justify gamma correct image at the popular level if some image format can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software take care to use extra precision when deal with linearize internal datum then gamma correct distribution of image would be a good thing I be tell that the Kodak photocd format for instance have a standard gamma correction factor that

also find no evidence to support that      hypothesis on the same ground as before we dismiss hypothesis b          the problem with this be that we have dismiss   all   of the possible      hypothesis and even though we know by construction that the money      arrive every month we have prove that it ca n't because we      have dismiss all of its potential cause      That be an

appearance of the buck should it happen be an     observation on Alterius and by construction be evidence for the     existence of   either the benefactor or the bug in the ATM          Premise 2 no observation on Alterius be possible       except for the bank you could n't possibly afford it      you forgot to include this my premise be actually      Premise 2 the cardinality of the set of possible observation on Alterius    be one      this be clearly contradictory to the first     not if you state it properly      trouble be on the basis of premise 2 you say that there can be no evidence     of   either the benefactor or the bug   but the first premise lead to the     conclusion that the appearance of the buck should it happen be evidence     for the existence of   either the benefactor or the bug          Voila a scream contradiction     with my highlight SC     but in a strawman argument there be only evidence for OneOf(Benefactor bug    no observation to distinguish Benefactor from Bug be possible that be       not evidence for bug and neither be it evidence for Benefactor nor       be true to say that this hypothetical universe appear exactly as    if there be no Benefactor   bug two statement both would be false    this be still contradictory it reduce to    1 alterian dosh arrive in my account be due to   benefactor or bug      2 this be not evidence for   benefactor   neither be it evidence for    bug   mean that it does n't lend more weight to one than to the   other    3 therefore no evidence can exist for   benefactor   and no evidence   can exist for   bug      but 3 rely on a shift in meaning from 2 when you say paraphrase   in 2 that this be not evidence for   benefactor   for example what you   mean be that it 's no   more   evidence for   benefactor   than it be for   bug   yes that be what I mean   in 3 however you 've shift the meaning of evidence for   benefactor    so that it now mean   absolute evidence for   benefactor   rather than    relative evidence for   benefactor   w.r.t   bug   not really I mean evidence that would tend to one over the other I think this be just a communication problem what I be try to say in my clumsy way be that while I buy your theory as far as it relate to theism make prediction prayer your rapture example I do n't buy your use of Occam 's razor in all case where a0 in my example one could n't dismiss   benefactor   or   bug   on the ground of simplicity one of these be necessary to explain the dosh I bring up the one by one dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so from what you 're say in this post it seem you agree and we 're talk at cross purpose   3 be still in contradiction to 1    some sum may help with b   benefactor b   bug d   dosh arrive in account    1 imply P(Bb   d   1    assume that p(bb   d   0 so it 's either the benefactor   or   a bug   which be responsible if the buck arrive but not both then    P(Bb   d   p(b   d   p(b   d    so    P(B   d   p(b   d   1    but 3 imply that    P(B   d   0 and p(b   d   0 no this is n't what I mean P(B   d   0.5 and p(b   d   0.5 with necessarily no new observation we 've already see the dosh to change those estimate I be try to say again in my clumsy way that it would be   wrong   to assign 0 probability to either of these and that be precisely what use of the Razor do in the case of god god be one class of hypothesis there be many other belong to a set of hypothesis   oneofwhich   be necessary to explain something which otherwise would   not   be satisfactorily explain it can be throw out or retain on ground of non rational preference not of science or statistic alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the ground that the answer ca n't be know or that the notional probability estimate be effectively useless be equal agnosticism   weak atheism    as they do when the set M be fill by the universe be cause by x    where x be god pink unicorn nothing etc and no observation    tend to one conclusion over the other    exactly the point I be make I think so we do n't throw out any of   these contrary to your assertion above that we do some people do Simon and they think they be do excellent science my sole point be that they are n't     only observation which directly contradict the hypothesis Hi   i.e. x     where p(x   hi     0 can cause p(hi   to go to zero after a finite     number of observation only in this case do we get to throw any of the     hypothese out     exactly my point though I may have be unclear    you say the diametric opposite which I guess be the source of my confusion I be merely try to illustrate the incorrectness of do so    what i 'm try to say be that while you be correct to say that absence of    evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this do not hold true for    all or perhaps any version of theism and it is n't true that those for    which it do not hold can be discard use the razor    on the contrary those for which it do not hold be   exactly   those which   can be discard use the Razor see my post on the other branch of this   thread then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse I of if the razor hold for god then it hold for all like hypothesis which mean that you 're assign p(x   Hi     0 for all I though we 've already establish that it 's not correct to do so when SUM(P(xHi))1 over all i.    simply put anyone who claim to have a viable proof of the existence or    non existence of god whether inductive or no be at good mistaken and    at bad bark mad    luckily I make no such claim and have specifically say as much on numerous   occasion you would n't be construct a strawman here would you Frank   although that does n't of course rule out my be bark mad in any case   I could be bark mad in my spare time with apology to Cleese et al    but I think you miss the point once again when I say that something be   evidence against an hypothesis that does n't imply that observation of   the say something necessarily   falsifie   the hypothesis reduce the   estimate of p(h   datum to zero if it   reduce   this quantity it 's still   evidence against H. No I get that I 'm talk about the case when A0 you 're clearly correct when A!0 and i 'm not construct a strawman though it be certainly possible that i 've misunderstood what you 're say however by any standard a system that say when A0 god be highly unlikely and when a!0 god can be dismiss use the Razor be a system purport to be an inductive proof that god either do n't exist or be unnecessary to explain any or all phenomenon in my experience system such as this include those which purport to prove that god exist always contain a fallacy upon close examination if that be not what you 're say then please put I straight;0

name of the committee that write the standard JPEG be design for compress either full color or gray scale digital image of natural real world scene it do not work so well on non realistic image such as cartoon or line drawing JPEG do not handle black and white 1 bit per pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name JBIG and mpeg respectively JPEG be lossy mean that the image you get out of decompression is n't quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieve much of its compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail are n't perceive as well as small detail of light and dark thus JPEG be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine analyze your image the small error introduce by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of JPEG be that the degree of lossiness can be vary by adjust compression parameter this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make   extremely   small file if you do n't mind poor quality- this be useful for indexing image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept less compression   2   why use JPEG there be two good reason to make your image file small and to store 24 bit per pixel color datum instead of 8 bit per pixel datum make image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archiving library of image be able to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 Kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare GIF and JPEG the size ratio be more like four to one More detail below if your view software does n't support JPEG directly you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for view or manipulating image even with a jpeg capable viewer it take long to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simple format GIF for instance thus use JPEG be essentially a time   space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply It 's worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a short file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format be that JPEG can store full color information 24 bit   pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or few color if you have only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though 8 bit GIF will look as obsolete as black and white MacPaint format do today furthermore for reason detail in section 7 JPEG be far more useful than GIF for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware hence JPEG be considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet post standard   3   when should I use jpeg and when should I stick with GIF JPEG be   not   go to displace GIF entirely- for some type of image GIF be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about JPEG be which kind of image to apply it to as a rule of thumb JPEG be superior to GIF for store full color or gray scale image of realistic scenes- that mean scan photograph and similar material JPEG be superior even if you do n't have 24 bit display hardware and it be a LOT superior if you do see section 7 for detail GIF do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such as cartoon and line drawing in particular large area of pixel that be all   exactly   the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by GIF JPEG ca n't squeeze these file as much as GIF do without introduce visible defect this sort of image be well keep in GIF form in particular single color border be quite cheap in GIF file but they should be avoid in JPEG file JPEG also have a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure black pixel adjacent to a row of pure white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing be not find in scanned photograph but it show up fairly often in GIF file border overlaid text etc the blurriness be particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixel high if you have a GIF with a lot of small size overlaid text do n't jpeg it computer draw image ray trace scene for instance usually fall between scanned image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it the same go for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such plain black and white two level image should never be convert to JPEG you need at least about 16 gray level before JPEG be useful for gray scale image it should also be note that GIF be lossless for gray scale image of up to 256 level while JPEG be not if you have an exist library of GIF image you may wonder whether you should convert they to JPEG you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argue that jpeg image quality be superior to GIF only apply if both format start from a full color original if you start from a GIF you 've already irretrievably lose a great deal of information- jpeg can only make thing bad however the disk space saving may justify convert anyway this be a decision you 'll have to make for yourself if you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hint be prepared to leave some image in GIF format since some gif will not convert well   4   how well do JPEG compress image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image I have handy a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purposes- the rest be create with the free jpeg software describe in section 6B. filet Size in bytesttcomment ship.ppmt1145040

full color display this seem to be a typical ratio for real world scene   5   what be good quality setting for jpeg Most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by select a quality setting there seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting Quality 95 do not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claim the quality scale be purely arbitrary- it be not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use JPEG be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompress into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality setting -Q 75 be very often the good choice this setting be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try -q 75 first- if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above -Q 95- say -Q 100 will produce a file two or three time as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any well quality if the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a high quality set to avoid further degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gif to JPEG the default -Q 75 be about right for compress 24 bit image but -Q 85 to 95 be usually well for convert gif see section 14 for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 be about right -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art note the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free jpeg software describe in section 6b and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program do n't even provide a numeric scale just high   medium   low style choice   6   where can I get JPEG software Most of the program describe in this section be available by FTP if you do n't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article how to find source if you do n't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in news.answer or you can get it by send e mail to mail-serverrtfm.mit.edu with send usenet   news.answer   finding source in the body the Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful it 's usenet   news.answer   ftp list   faq in the news.answer archive note this list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late JPEG FAQ from the news.answer archive   6a   if you be look for can software viewer etc the first part of this list be system specific program that only run on one kind of system if you do n't see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software describe at the end of the list note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over Internet- but some commercial program be list too X Windows XV shareware   25 be an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other image format it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulation It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu 18.24.0.12 file contrib   xv-3.00.tar Z. Version 3.00 be a major upgrade with support for 24 bit display and many other improvements- however it be brand new and still have some bug lurk if you prefer not to be on the bleed edge stick with version 2.21 also available from export note that version 2.21 be not a good choice if you have a 24 bit display you 'll get only 8 bit color nor for convert 24 bit image to JPEG but 2.21 work fine for convert GIF and other 8 bit image to JPEG caution there be a glitch in version 2.21 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x Windows be John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   ImageMagick.tar Z. this package handle many image processing and conversion task the ImageMagick viewer handle 24 bit display correctly- for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support JPEG in its late release 3.03 xloadimage be free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xloadimage-3.03.tar Z. xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by its fan to be somewhat fast and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed fast and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it have the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 be use a hack over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xli.1.14.tar Z. both program be say to do the right thing with 24 bit display MS DOS this cover plain dos- for Windows or os2 program see the next heading one good choice be Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG which view JPEG and GIF file the current version 2.5 be available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca 129.97.50.50 file pub   jpeg   viewer   dvpeg25.zip this be a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386486 machine the user interface be not flashy but it 's functional another freeware JPEG   GIF   TGA viewer be Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview the current version 1.2 be available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   hv12.zip Hiview require a 386 or well cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager QEMM386 and 386max work- Windows and os2 do not Hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen for large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning   scroll as most viewer do you may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no deny that it slow down loading of large image considerably note installation be a bit tricky- read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be ColorView for DOS   30 this be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative its user interface be also much spiffier look although personally I find it hard to use more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be fast than DVPEG but a little slow than Hiview at least on my hardware for image large than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both be fast than Hiview the current version be 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   dcview21.zip require a vesa graphic driver- if you do n't have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory many recent pc have a build in vesa driver so do n't try to load a vesa driver unless ColorView complain that the driver be miss a second shareware alternative be Fullview which have be kick around the net for a while but I do n't know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway the author tell I that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the Simtel20 archive at that time the well know GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW support JPEG in its late revision 8.60a however CSHOW 's jpeg implementation is n't very good it 's slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi color display too bad it 'd have be nice to see a good jpeg capability in CSHOW Shareware   25 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   gif   cshw860a.zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic hardware any one of these viewer might not work on your particular machine if you ca n't get   any   of they to work you 'll need to use one of the following conversion program to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer if you have hi color hardware do n't use GIF as the intermediate format- try to find a targa capable viewer instead VPIC5.0 be repute to do the right thing with hi color display the Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converter be ftpable from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   jpeg4.zip or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory these file be DOS compilation of the free source code describe in section 6b- they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM format Handmade Software offer free JPEGGIF conversion tool GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF these be slow and be limit to conversion to and from GIF format- in particular you ca n't get 24 bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tool be that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary jpeg format as well as the Usenet standard JFIF format since HSI format file be rather widespread on BBSes this be a useful capability Version 2.0 of

bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decodes- and the image quality be noticeably bad than other viewer but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway at least for previewing JView be freeware fairly fast have good on line help and can write out the decompress image in Windows BMP format- but it ca n't create new jpeg file and it does n't view gif JView also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer such as brightness adjustment but it be an excellent basic viewer the current version 0.9 be available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.84 file pub   pc   win3   desktop

68020 or well cpu and you need to be run System 6.0.7 or later if you 're run System 6 you must also install the 32 bit QuickDraw extension- this be build in on System 7 you can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   quicktime.hqx as of 1192 this file contain QuickTime 1.5 which be well than QT 1.0 in several way with respect to jpeg it be marginally fast and considerably less prone to crash when feed a corrupt jpeg file however some application seem to have compatibility problem with QT 1.5 Mac user should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format PICT   JPEG be not the same as the Usenet standard JFIF JPEG format see section 10 for detail if you post image on Usenet make sure they be in JFIF format Most of the program mention below can generate either format the first choice be probably jpegview a free program for view image that be in JFIF format PICT   JPEG format or GIF format it also can convert between the two JPEG format the current version 2.0 be a big improvement over prior version get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 file info mac   app   jpeg view-20.hqx require System 7 and QuickTime on 8 bit display jpegview usually produce the good color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewer jpegview can view large image in much less memory than other Mac viewers- in fact it 's the only one that can deal with jpeg image much over 640x480 pixel on a typical 4 MB Mac give a large image jpegview automatically scale it down to fit on the screen rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer you can zoom in on any desire portion though some people like this behavior some do n't Overall JPEGView 's user interface be very well think out GIFConverter a shareware   40 image viewer   converter support JFIF and PICT   JPEG as well as GIF and several other image format the late version be 2.3.2 get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   art   gif   gif converter-232.hqx Requires System 6.0.5 or later GIFConverter be not well than JPEGView as a plain jpeg   GIF viewer but it have much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image also the new version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF image   without   QuickTime so it be your good bet if your machine be too old to run QuickTime but it 's fast with QuickTime note if GIFConverter run out of memory try to load a large jpeg try convert the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then view the GIF version JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utility be available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   jpeg convert-10.hqx this will run on any Mac but it only do file conversion not view you can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer previous version of this FAQ recommend Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEGGIF converter base on an old version of the IJG code if you be use this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert Apple 's free program PictPixie can view image in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these format you can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   qt.1.0.stuff   pictpixie.hqx require QuickTime PictPixie be intend as a developer 's tool and it 's really not the good choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime some of its drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface bad PictPixie be an unsupported program mean it have some minor bug that Apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of PictPixie call PICTCompressor float around the net if you have this you should trash it as it 's even buggy also the QuickTime Starter Kit include a much clean up descendant of PictPixie call Picture Compressor note that Picture Compressor be not free and may not be distribute on the net storm technology 's Picture Decompress be a free JPEG viewer   converter this rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be force to use it on old system it do need 32 bit QuickDraw so really old machine ca n't use it you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   picture decompress-201.hqx you must set the file type of a download image file to jpeg to allow Picture Decompress to open it if your machine be too old to run 32 bit QuickDraw a Mac plus for instance GIFConverter be your only choice for single program JPEG view if you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer More and more commercial Mac application be support jpeg although not all can deal with the Usenet standard JFIF format Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF format jpeg file use the JPEG plug in from the Acquire menu you must set the file type of a download jpeg

quantization Most people do n't have full color 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 or few bit per pixel so it can display 256 or few distinct color at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color this process be call color quantization this be something of a misnomer color selection would be a well term we 're stick with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy process it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by JPEG except at the very low jpeg quality setting since JPEG be a full color format convert a color jpeg image for display on 8 bit or less hardware require color quantization this be true for   all   color jpeg even if you feed a 256 or less color GIF into JPEG what come out of the decompressor be   not   256 color but thousand of color this happen because JPEG 's lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get smear into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be always require to display a color jpeg on a colormappe display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a JPEG image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference I occasionally see post image describe as 256 color jpeg this tell I that the poster a has n't read this FAQ and b probably convert the jpeg from a GIF jpeg can be classify as color or gray scale just like photograph but number of color just is n't a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a GIF image by definition have already be quantize to 256 or few color a GIF   do   have a definite number of color in its palette and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entry for purpose of Usenet picture distribution GIF have the advantage that the sender precompute the color quantization so recipient do n't have to this be also the   disadvantage   of GIF you 're stick with the sender 's quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re quantize result in much poor image quality than if you have quantize once from a full color image furthermore if the sender did n't use a high quality color quantization algorithm you 're out of luck for this reason JPEG offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine do n't match the sender 's display hardware JPEG 's full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user 's display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of jpeg image you already have with a GIF you 're stick forevermore with what be send It 's also worth mention that many GIF view program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a 256 color GIF on a 16 color EGA display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to this be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the GIF one to display it but often it be also due to sloppiness JPEG conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizer in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be display thus JPEG be likely to provide well result than the average GIF program for low color resolution display as well as high resolution one finally an ever grow number of people have well than-8 bit display hardware already 15 bit hi color pc display true 24 bit display on workstation and macintosh etc for these people GIF be already obsolete as it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thus JPEG be an all around well choice than GIF for represent image in a machine independent fashion   8   how do jpeg work the buzz word to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transform coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article 's long enough already so i 'm not go to say more than that here for technical information see the comp.compression FAQ this be available from the news.answer archive at rtfm.mit.edu in file pub   usenet   news.answer   compression faq   part1 3   if you need help in use the news.answer archive see the top of this article   9   what about lossless jpeg There be a great deal of confusion on this subject the JPEG committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantee the final output be bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offer much less compression at present very few implementation of lossless JPEG exist and all of they be commercial say -q 100 to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossless image what it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsample step with the v4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsample keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular JPEG algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value- it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit for bit accuracy if you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than 6 bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard this perform well than jpeg lossless on such image JPEG lossless be superior to JBIG on image with 6 or more bit per pixel- furthermore JPEG be public domain at least with a Huffman back end while the JBIG technique be heavily cover by patent   10   why all the argument about file format strictly speak JPEG refer only to a family of compression algorithms- it do   not   refer to a specific image file format the JPEG committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we ca n't actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leave we with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to do their own thing and as a result their program are n't compatible with anybody else 's the close thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format be some work that be be coordinate by people at C Cube Microsystems they have define two jpeg base file format   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a low end format that transport pixel and not much else   tiff   JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format TIFF be a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides TIFF be a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of TIFF It 's not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these format be develop with input from all the major vendor of jpeg relate products- it 's reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture posting JFIF be simple than TIFF and be available now- the TIFF 6.0 spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when TIFF   JPEG be well define the JFIF format be likely to be a widely support low common denominator- tiff   jpeg file may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in be Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh QuickTime use a JFIF compatible format wrap inside the Mac specific pict structure conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG be pretty straightforward and several Mac program be available to do it see Mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a QuickTime jpeg PICT down to JFIF by hand- see section 11 for detail another particular case be Handmade Software 's program GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy these program be capable of read and write JFIF format by default though they write a proprietary format develop by HSI this format be not readable by any non hsi program and should not be use for Usenet posting use the -j switch to get JFIF output this apply to old version of these programs- the current release emit JFIF format by default you still should be careful not to post HSI format file unless you want to get flame by people on non pc platform   11   how do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wo n't read it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary jpeg base format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file 1 a JFIF standard file will start with the character hex FF d8 FF E0 follow by two variable byte often hex 00 10 follow by jfif 2 if you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this be probably decodable as be by JFIF software it 's worth a try anyway 3 HSI file start with hsi1 You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg datum but they wo n't decompress properly with non hsi program 4 a Macintosh pict file if jpeg compress will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a JFIF header scan for JFIF strip off everything before the FF d8 and you should be able to read it 5 anything else it 's a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG datum stream if you can identify the start of the JPEG datum stream look for FF D8 try strip off everything before that in uuencoded Usenet posting the characteristic JFIF pattern be tbegin line tmcx whereas uuencoded HSI file will start with tbegin line tm:'-i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non jfif file   12   what about arithmetic coding the JPEG spec define two different back end module for the final output of compress datum either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding be allow the choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produce a small compressed file on typical image arithmetic coding produce a file 5 or 10 percent small than Huffman code all the file size number previously cite be for Huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specify by the JPEG standard be subject to patent own by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi thus   you can not legally use arithmetic coding   unless you obtain license from these company the fair use doctrine allow people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at well at least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding- the space saving is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic coding   should not   be use for any image to be exchange on Usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for further detail   13   do loss accumulate with repeat compression   decompression it would be nice if having compress an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately this be not the case in general recompresse an altered image lose more information though usually not as much as be lose the first time around the next good thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it   without change it   then there be no further loss i.e. you get an identical jpeg file even this be not true- at least not with the current free JPEG software It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on our to do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limit but I be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guarantee would be that compress the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple change as crop off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you 're wonder why it 's because the pixel block boundary move if you crop off only multiple of 16 pixel you might be safe but that be a mighty limited capability the bottom line be that JPEG be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossless format PPM RLE TIFF etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression   decompression time this way   14   what be some rule of thumb for convert GIF image to jpeg as state early you   will   lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist GIF image to JPEG if you can obtain the original full color datum the GIF be make from it 's far well to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality the first rule when convert a GIF library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif- that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary some gif may be well leave as GIFs as explain in section 3- in particular cartoon type GIFs with sixteen or few color do n't convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be   large   than the GIF so check the size too experience to date suggest that large high visual quality gif be the good candidate for conversion to JPEG they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to JPEG with least degradation do n't waste your time convert any GIF much under 100 Kbytes also do n't expect jpeg file convert from GIFs to be as small as those create directly from full color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg file would be i.e. shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the GIF file not 14th as suggest in early comparison many people have develop an odd habit of put a large constant color border around a GIF image while useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in GIF file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact ghost edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpege if you be on an x Windows system XV 's manual and automatic cropping function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default q setting of 75 be appropriate for full color input but for GIF input q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggest below the high Q setting may not be necessary Color gif of photograph or complex artwork be usually dither to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that GIF can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different colors- at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to JPEG it look like high spatial frequency color noise- and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have get from jpege the original full color image if you have it to get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression smooth average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you think you see anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color change that give JPEG trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid use a high q factor thus far reduce the size of the compressed file while still obtain a well look output image than you 'd get without smooth with the v4 free JPEG software or product base on it a simple smoothing capability be build in try -smooth 10 or so when convert gif value of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gif heavy handed dithering may require large smoothing factor if you can see regular fine scale pattern on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing be definitely call for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you do n't want if you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package however cjpeg 's build in smoother be a LOT fast than pnmconvol the upshot of all this be that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 be probably a good starting point for convert GIFs but if you really care about the image you 'll want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting for more information about JPEG in general or

384;I think that if a theist be truly objective and throw out the notion that God definitely exist and start from scratch to prove to themselves that the scripture be the whole truth then that person would no long be a theist you 're miss something here there be people who convert from non theism to theism after be bring up in a non theist household I do n't have any statistic as to how many though that would be an interesting thing to know I think that religion be a crutch People be naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable People do n't want to believe that when they die they be dead finish that there be nothing else after that and so religion be kind of a nice fantasy religion also describe thing we do n't know about the universe thing science have not yet describe and it also give people a feeling of security that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok that they be be watch over by a high power and its minion this have a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these people be willing to put up with a few discrepancy and hole in their belief system for what it gain they this be why I think it 's kind of useless to try too hard to convert theist to atheism they be happy with their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too they ca n't accept the fact that there be people who would rather accept the harsh reality that they be run from anyway I 'm getting kind of carry away here but my point be that theism does n't have to be ingrain into a child 's mindset for that person to grow up as a theist although this happen far too often Theism be design to have its own attraction;3

434;why should anyone check let 's restrict this to Christians why do   we   want to find commandment in the book regard as scripture What be go on I will pass on psychologize answer whether dismissive or more open as not the kind of issue to deal with here the question be what be the   theological   point involve and it have be quote at I often enough by those who do n't believe I take it seriously that Jesus be say to have say if you love I you will obey my command   John 14:15   I be like any Christian the slave of Christ and it be my will that I should do as he will I to do I be also or instead his young brother but still under his direction though we both call God Abba Christians therefore will try to find what it be that their Lord command they and discover it will feel obligated to do it or to confess their failure reader here may set aside the theologize jargon such as slave of Christ the point be that adherent of a religion   will   read the text whether classify as inspire or not that be hold up as model in an effort to find application to their own situation this practice range from devotional reading of sermon and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as the Word of God and at the high pitch this lead to a question of whether we   can   find in inspire scripture something that can act as absolute guidance for our action the problem be in find out just   what   it be our Lord command I be go to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians have look for these command namely christian tradition that be not because   I   reject tradition but because my primary audience in this essay be Protestants who deny tradition a determinative value in favor of the witness of Scripture the question I want to deal with be what commandment can we find from our Lord in Scripture and that turn out to be a hard question   if any of my protestant Inquisitors would   like   to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition I can accomodate they unlike   most   protestant Episcopalians admit claim from a Scripture b Reason and c tradition on roughly equal standing   early in John than my quote above we read   John 13:34   I give you a new commandment love one another this be the only place in the NT where Christians be give an explicit commandment with the context comment on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus at the same meal   so we   reader   infer since it be   not   in John but in the synoptic   Jesus say take this   bread- this be my body   Mark 14:22 cf Matthew 26:26 Luke 22:19 1 Corinthians 11:24   the mode be imperative greek   labete   and hence this too be a commandment in   both   case we have to   infer   that the command be direct to a wide circle than the immediate collocation of disciple because we judge the evangelist 's point in mention it with the disciple by then mostly or entirely dead be that   we   be expect to follow this as a commandment from our Lord in the case of communion Paul 's mention at least- this be probably true of the evangelist also imply an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these word operate to bind Christians to the original command to his disciple as a continue commandment to the Christian community I be entirely comfortable with this inference but I   must   point out that it be there between we and the occasion on which Jesus speak the command I take it as a clear inference at the very least the evangelist 's notion that   all   Christians be call to love one another in Jesus command direct at the disciple but I have to call attention to the inference the command CANNOT apply to I without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of Christ all reading of scripture have to make such inference to get any sense out of the text whatsoever this be a general problem in read these text we can not read they at all without our   own   understanding of our native language in which we normally read the translate text and without   some   appreciation of the original context and at point the original language when english mislead we I be go to presume in what follow that we have the   general   problem of how to read scripture under control   I do n't   really   think this be true but it will suffice for my current purpose   I will address only the issue that arise when we have already cope with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in question at that level only introduce MORE reser- vation about the commandment issue than will be find stipulate that we can read the text as the original audience might have do among the reason we have for see John 's   agapate allelou   as a   general   commandment not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciple on that one occasion and one link it to the Synoptic Great Commandment be that we have criticism from Jesus about limit our love to those whom we congenially associate with in Matthew 5:43ff we read you have learn say to you love your enemy in fact the Leviticus context quote do not say hate your enemy it be merely the common human presumption and Leviticus be at pain to say that the love should extend to stranger amongst the people of Israel Luke in expand on this same q context go on to have Jesus say even sinner love those who love they   6:27   all of this suggest   quite strongly I 'd say   that   limit   the scope of the new commandment be not quite what Jesus have in mind in short inference   lead I   to generalize the actual text to a command that be in force on Christians and with object not limit to other Christians tricky than the   agapate allelou   or Institution of communion there be the case of the Great Commission where Matthew 10 Mark 6 the Twelve be send out to evangelize proclaim that the kingdom of heaven be close at hand the verb be imperative   ke russete   but the context be rather specific to the Twelve and there be further specifier as in do not turn your step to pagan territory and do not enter any samaritan town the Lukan parallel be even more specific to Jesus final journey to Jerusalem which make it hard to see this generalizing to all Christians than the previous example that has n't prevent Christians from make such an inference- what I have to call attention to be that such inference be not justify in the text nor unlike the first two case I cite by the rhetoric of the evangelist urge on the reader still Paul seem to have felt oblige to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven be close at hand even contrary to Jesus instruction to the 12 to the gentile to the end of the earth so Christians after he have also take this as a commandment in the sense of John 14:15 do I accept this I do n't know it be surely rather speculative but you see how the ripple of inference spread out from the text that be the pretext Christians may infer a general commandment applicable to all from what be present in the gospel as a specific occasion I do not necessarily object to this kind of generalization but I   insist   that people who make it   must   have an understanding that they be   reason   at some considerable length from what we actually   have   in scripture there be   assumption   involve in this reasoning and   these   be   not   themselves scriptural though people will do their good to justify their assumption by other reference to scripture which simply add MORE inference into the mix Let 's move on to the Great Commandment that we should love God with our whole heart and mind and soul this be perhaps the synoptic equivalent of John 's   agapate allelou   and yet it be not present as a commandment in our text rather the context be controversy with the Pharisees to cite Matthew   22:34ff   tBut when the Pharisees hear that he have silence the Sadducees tthey get together and to disconcert he one of they put a question tmaster which be the great commandment of the Law it be by no mean obvious here though I accept it as such that Jesus answer be mean to be a commandment   to Christians   he be answer a polemic from his enemy   Mark 's account in 12:28 34 cast the answer in a far more positive light as so the scribe in this version say far more important than any holocaust I need to point out that this word originate in the context of animal sacrifice- forget the Nazis for this or sacrifice Luke be intermediate he have a lawyer pose the question to disconcert Jesus and get the Good Samarian parable for his pain   Luke 10:25 37   the context here be so confusingly various that one could be forgive for draw   no   inference in   no   account be this say as if it be obviously to be take as a commandment bind on Christians though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that Jesus think it to be so the point be that our mental gear have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what we be command to do by Jesus and all of this be contingent on our understanding the point of Jesus use of the Torah in the all quite different gospel account and the application of such a context to   we   the different context among the synoptic be curious it should be note that only in Luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of the Good Samaritan we may look for an analogous   intent   in Matthew where 7:12 give the Golden Rule as the meaning of the Law and the Prophets and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel say the same a generation before Jesus if we make these association which I think be entirely reasonable we be again indulge in inference the text do not   explicitly   support us- rather we   read   the text as have this kind of inter relationship current literary theory call this intertextuality my discussion of why the   agapate allelou   have to apply beyond the community of the disciple and beyound the circle of christian believer apply again here to buttress a conclusion that this   be   despite the presentation not say so explicitly a commandment to Christians few Christians would disagree with my conclusion but I   must   point out that they   be   conclusion they   depend   on rather elaborate chain of reasoning that be simply not present in the text themselves the contextual problem keep come up more and more severely as we look at those saying of Jesus that be not so universally take by Christians as commandment and we get some really hard case take divorce Mark be pretty clear the man who divorce his wife and marry another be guilty of adultery against she   10:11 cf Luke 16:18   except that Matthew have an escape clause   except in the case of fornication 5:31   this seem to be a rather clear commandment whether or not we take Matthew 's reservation)- and some Christians to this day take it so but some do n't at least in practice this be rather peculiar- it be not as if Jesus be not explicit about this whereas he say nothing at all about some of the thing people gnash their tooth over how be it possible if the command of Christ be clear that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelist of the synoptic tradition I 'm go to continue this examination into ever murky water but this be enough to start with the theme be find commandment in scripture be an exercise in inference- our inference be inform by our assumption that is our own cultural bias I have so far identify a very few commandment that be generally accept by all Christians and yet in these already some of the difficulty start to surface it be these difficulty I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic the divorce commandment already strike at some of the difficulty I see almost no evidence that the people who be so eager to find commandment to condemn   I   with spend any time at all write nasty screed to soc.couple or misc.legal about the horror or viciousness of divorce or demand that US law refuse to allow it or refuse unrepentant divorcee place in their church   that be not to say that divorce   does n't   enter into consideration in general it be most definitely a matter of concern in even the most liberal church circle for example a wildly liberal episcopalian priest of my aqauintence in a wildly liberal diocese have recommend to a couple who approach he to marry they that they have a private secular ceremony before a judge so that the public ceremony he celebrate need not go through an agonizing examination by official who would just as soon not take on this role of interpret the command we be face with as Christians this in a church that be effectively create by a famous divorce  ;3

447;can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when question the truth of his scripture or will he assume the superstition of his parent when question I 've often find it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wonder about God and his scripture i 've see it in the Christian the Jew the Muslim and the other theist alike all assume that their mother and father be right in the aspect that a god exist and with that belief search for their god occasionally the theist may switch religion or aspect of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some creator be behind the universe 's existence I 've know Muslims who be once Christians and vice versa I 've know Christians who be once jewish and vice versa and I 've even know Christians who become Hindu yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they 've keep this belief in some form of high be why it usually all have to do with how the child be bring up from the time he be bear the theist be bring up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture-- the Bible the Torah the Qur'an   etc he be tell of this wondrous God who write or inspire the scripture of the prophet talk about in the scripture of the miracle perform   etc he be also tell that to question this as child be apt to do be a sin a crime against God and to lose belief in the scrip- ture 's truth be to damn one 's soul to Hell thus by the time he be able to read the scripture for himself the belief in its truth be so ingrained in his mind it all seem a matter of course but it does n't stop there once the child be able to read for himself there be an endeavor to inculcate the child the right reading of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant reading to gloss over the bad one and to explain away the unexplainable with mystery circular argument self evdent fact and truth unreasoning belief and fear of hell be the meat of religion the child must eat of every day to doubt of course mean wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concern God all of this have some considerable effect on the child so that when he become an adult the superstition he 's be teach be nearly impossible to remove all of this lead I to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when question God Hell Heaven the angel soul and all of the rest can he for a moment put aside this notion that God   do   exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view obviously most theist can somewhat especially when present with mythical god Homeric Roman Egyptian   etc but can they put aside the assumption of God 's existence and question it impartially Stephen           atheist                 libertarian             pro individuality             pro responsibility            Jr.   and all that jazz;3

MIT Press 1987 ISBN 0 262 21009 6 but before you go off and start code check out the image manipulation software mention in item 7 below all of the package mention can do some form of gray to bw conversion 6 rotate a raster image by an arbitrary angle the obvious but wrong method be to loop over the pixel in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this be wrong because it leave hole in the destination instead loop over the pixel in the destination image apply the   reverse   transformation to the coordinate and copy that pixel from the source this method be quite general and can be use for any one to one 2 d mapping not just rotation you can add anti aliase by do sub pixel sampling however there be a much fast method with antialise include which involve do three shear operation the method be originally create for the IM Raster Toolkit see below)- an implementation be also present in PBMPLUS reference a Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation

detail on some also the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils be specifically for discussion of software like this you may find useful information there 8) Format document for TIFF IFF BIFF NFF OFF fit etc you almost certainly do n't need these read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software get one or more of these package and look through they chance be excellent that the image converter you be go to write be already there but if you still want one of the format document many such file be available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub   graphics.format these file be collect off the net and be believe to be correct this archive include pixel format and two- and three dimensional object format the future of this archive be uncertain at the moment as Mark Hall

often use in astronomy despite the name it can contain not only image but other thing as well there be a regular monthly fit basic and information post on sci.astro.fit read it if you want to know more 9 convert between vector format a lot of people ask about convert from HPGL to PostScript or MacDraw to CGM or whatever it be important to understand that this be a very different problem from the image format conversion in item 7 convert one image format to another be a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel be a pixel the basic object be the same for all image format this be not so for vector format the basic object circle ellipsis drop shadow pattern fill round corner rectangle etc vary from one format to another except in extremely restrict case it be simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector format there be software for convert to and from CGM file on ftp.psc.edu the contributor state that it run on Unix MS Windows and possibly the Mac a well more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it be quite possible to do a close approximation render an image from one format use the primitive from another as far as I know no one have put together a general toolkit of such converter but two different hpgl to PostScript converter have be post to comp.sources.misc check the index on your near archive site a related frequent question be how to convert from some vector format to a bitmappe image from PostScript to Sun raster format or HPGL to X11 bitmap for example some of the commercial PostScript clone for PC 's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer also the PostScript interpreter in the NeXT box and in Sun 's X11   NeWs can be use to render to a file if you 're clever but in general the answer be no however if someone be to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit add a vector to raster converter would be trivial GNU ghostscript from the FSF current version 2.5.2 include driver for both ppm and gif format file thus it can be use as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter it implement essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display

be you ca n't unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle the approximation may look acceptable but it be sensitive to scale magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifie deviation from circularity that be not visible in the small can become glare in the large if you want to do the job right consult the article a Menagerie of Rational B Spline Circles by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications volume 9 number 9 September 1989 page 48 56 for rough non rational approximation consult the book Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt Ellis Horwood Publishers Halsted Press John Wiley 1980 for the well know non rational approximation consult the article Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature continuous Bezier Curves by Tor

and continue to infinity if it cross an odd number of polygon edge along the way the point be within the polygon if the ray cross an even number of edge the point be either outside the polygon or within an interior hole form from intersect polygon edge this idea be know in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem- see Eric Haines article in Glassner 's ray trace book above for more information include treatment of special case another method be to sum the absolute angle from the point to all the vertex on the polygon if the sum be 2 pi the point be inside if the sum be 0 the point be outside however this method be about an order of magnitude slow than the previous method because evaluate the trigonometric function be usually quite costly Code for both method plus barycentric

I have no quibble with that belief other than that it be useless and that objective be a perfectly good word    so what   be   objective not the age of the universe anyway as I show    above    how many age can the universe have and still be internally self-   consistent i 'd be amazed if it be more than one how many different   moral system can different member of society have indeed single   individual in some case and humanity still stick together beg the question People can have many opinion about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together you be say that the universe have a   real   age independent of my belief about it why   the age of the universe like most scientific fact can be   emirically verify through mean that 'll give the same result no matter   who perform the testing albeit there be error bar that may be on the   largish side this assume that the universe have a real age or any kind of reality which does n't depend on what we think why should an extreme Biblical Creationist give a rat 's ass about the mean of which you speak   i 've hear of no way to verify morality in a   consistent way much less compute the error of the measurement- care to   enlighten I the same be true of pain but painkiller exist and can be predict to work with some accuracy well than a random guess I write elsewhere that morality should be hypothesis about observe value if a moral system make a prediction it will be well if that can be test and be falsifiable in the same way as a prediction this drug will relieve pain   People 's   idea   about the age of object x be   not   objective-   you can have any idea you like and I ca n't stop you Universae and   their age be another ballgame- they be what they be and if you   dislike some detail of they that be a problem with your   opinion   of   they sure assume an objective reality and you get statement like this   I claim that morality be an opinion of ours and as such   subjective and individual if I 'm wrong then some more or less   objectively real thing exist which you label objective morality-   can you back up this positive claim of existence can you back up your positive claim above no That 's because it 's an assumption I make the same assumption about value on the basis that there be no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two be precisely the same     point moral be in essence personal opinion usually     ideally well found motivate such but nonetheless personal the     fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question     sometimes even for the same reason do not make moral objective- it     make human somewhat alike in their opinion on that moral question     which can be good for the evolution of a social specie      and if a real large lot nice phrase of people agree that there be a    football on a desk I 'm suppose to see a logical difference between the two    perhaps you can explain the difference to I since you seem to see it    so clearly    take a look on the desk i.e. perform a test If(football then   accept theory ELSE DO tell people they 're hallucinating    now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform I   which way to look and why to look that particular way as oppose to   some other get my drift no just look be you claim never to know what good mean      science   be a whole other matter altogether      say you prove that those who disagree be wrong    That be a simple matter of prove the track record of the   scientific method I think it 's great and should be apply to value I may be completely wrong but that be what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought;0

court for his dream interpretation and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion 's pit he also appear in the last chapter of the book as the revealer of divine mystery and of the

alone while as a visionary apocalyptist in Daniel 7 12 write in the first person he be in need of an angel to help he decode his vision and mystery of the future it be likely that the name Daniel be pseudonymous a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man know from ugaritic legend and early biblical tradition Ez 14:4,28:3 the authorship of the book be complicated not only by the diverse narrative voice and content but by its language Daniel 1:1 2:4a and 8 12 be write in Hebrew whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 be in Aramaic the language division parallel the subject division Daniel 1 6

their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral tradition and many refuse to desecrate the statue of Moses and endure a martyr 's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion all of the vision of

archangel and by Christians as Christ in chapter 7- via zodiacal image of cosmic beast with bizarre manifestation as in chapter 8- or via complex reinterpretation of ancient prophecy especially those

advocate a stance of piety civil disobedience and trustful resignation victory for the faithful be in the hand of the archangel Michael and the martyr will be resurrect and grant astral immortality persumably the circle behind the book be not the same as the Maccabean fighter and may reflect some proto Pharisaic group of hasidim or pietist the theme of resistance to oppression freedom of worship preservation of monotheistic integrity the overthrow of historical dominion and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have serve as a token of trust for the faithful

496;I feel compel to complain the statement that recent observation rule out merge neutron star as source of gamma ray burst be utterly false even though it be popular enough to make it to BATSE press release the idea behind the statement be as follow if you smack two neutron star together or have a neutron star be gobble up by a black hole a lot of energy be release enough for a gamma ray burst at a cosmological distance but so the reasoning continue this energy be release below a lot of matter so the radiation becomes thermalize and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum the observed spectra be strongly non thermal so this model must be wrong as so often the fault lie with the imagination of the person who be try to prove the model wrong rather than with the model it may be that the initial energy release be not see as a gamma ray burst but the fireball of energy and matter that be create may spew out a relativistic flow when this slam into the surround medium a strong flux of non thermal gamma ray result which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy all this be not my idea it be in a series of paper by Martin Rees Peter Meszaros sorry for the miss accents:- and co worker it be certainly not a complete model but it may well be the good one around sum over all propose distance scale an alternative proposal for what create the initial fireball by the way be the so call failed supernovae scenario by Stan Woosley in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapse to a black hole if the stellar core be rotate part of the infalle matter will be temporarily halt because it be support by centrifugal force and form a very dense neutron torus that accrete onto the black hole this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis which again constitute relativistic flow the rate of such event may be much high than that of neutron star merger but the flux may be more strongly beam so that the net rate of burst observe on Earth stay the same between the two scenario but the energy release per event can be a lot less in the fail supernova scenario on another note I do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolve via some classical astronomical method such as find counterpart to the burst at other wavelength or find a definitive signature of some know class of object in the distribution of position and flux theorist have historically not be too successfull in find the distance of any object by prove that there be only one possible way in which the object can work and therefore it   must   be so and so;2

511;I ca n't see the need for a single big expensive heavy mothership except for Voyager style flyby mission a few year ago I do some calculation on a Grand Tour space probe launch by a Saturn v in 1975 76 at the time I feel that the idea of a big mother ship have some merit the Voyagers have to be rather small lightweight craft due to the limitation impose by use weak Titan III   Centaur launcher the concept I examine and Michael 's have a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society 's Daedalus project for send a probe to Barnard 's Star i.e. a large bus spacecraft carry several small probe to be dispatch when the ship arrive at its destination the Saturn v supposedly would have be able to launch a 10 ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond the bus could have include far more powerful camera   telescope   scientific equipment and a heavy   more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitation on weight anymore extremely important as the Voyagers have to perform most of their measurement within a couple of week before and after planetary encounter and usually at a relatively great distance the small probe carry aboard might have be base on the real Voyagers and an even small version like the one schedule for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century and would have be release at various point during the mission the advantage be obvious the bus would have carry out the same basic Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune mission than Voyager 2 do but in addition two sub probe could have be relase at Saturn examine that planet 's south polar region before move on to Pluto this would have enable NASA to map both hemisphere of Pluto   Charon by 1986 and several other probe could have examine part of the Jupiter   Saturn   Uranus   Neptune system that were n't examine in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory relate factor a small swarm of camera equip miniature space probe release a month before encounter would have be too costly for a small Voyager type mission but entirely feasible if launch from a heavy well equip spacecraft and would we have learn a lot more about the outer planet the reason why the Grand Tour be cancel be lack of money of course marcu;2

521;thank to the people who have answer here and in email to my question about which country engage in space surveillance unfortunately I apparently did n't make the meaning of the message clear since most reply have address satellite reconnaissance rather than space surveillance what I mean be   not   which country use satellite to look at the Earth satellite reconnaissance but   be   which country have program to detect and track i.e. determine the orbital element of satellite as they pass overhead space surveillance the US use missile defense radar supplement by a fascinating quasi radar operate by the Navy to do this for satellite in LEO and electrooptical system for object at altitude above 5,000 km or so the FEE I understand do much the same thing Amateur satellite observer use eyeball binocular stopwatch and pc for object out to around 1500 km enable they to keep track of satellite for which ah official element set are n't available see the fascinating book by Desmond King Hele for detail as well as the file in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov the material post in my previous message suggest that Japan engage in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree and it may be that other country do also which be the question I mean to ask who be they how do they do it and why do they do it Allen Thomson SAIC McLean VA;2

CERL it be a popular geographic and remote sense image processing package many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image processing package although it be report to have significant image processing capability Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it 's public domain and can be obtain through the internet for free GRASS run in Unix and be write in C. the source code can be obtain through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass Integration you then compile the source code for your machine use script provide with GRASS I would recommend GRASS for someone who already have a workstation and be on a limited budget GRASS be not very user friendly compare to Macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicate that it look useful and have some pixel resample function not in other package plus good general purpose image enhancement routine fft Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in Boulder CO be a primary user of GRASS this gentleman have use the GRASS software and developed multi spectral 238 band volumetric rendering full color on Suns and Stardents it be a really effective interface Vexcel Corp. currently have a contract to map

range of gis software   hardware microstation be a base graphic package that Imager sit on top of Imager be basically an image processing package with a heavy GIS   remote sense flavor Feature Description basic geometry manipulation flip mirror rotate generalize affine rectification Affine 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th order model as well as a projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image RGB to IHS and ihs to RGB conversion Principal component analysis classification k mean and isodata Fourier Xforms forward filtering and reverse filter high pass low pass edge enhancing median generic Complex Histogram   Contrast control Layer Controller manage up to 64 image at a time user can extract single band from a 3 band image or create color image by combine various individual band etc the package be design for a remote sense application it can handle very large image and there be all kind of other software available for gis application Host Configuration Requirements it run on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun though there be rumor there be always rumor that the software would be port to pc and possibly a Sun environment PCI a company call PCI Inc. out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada make an array of software utility for processing manipulation and use of remote sense datum in eight or ten different industry standard format LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of other whose title I forget the software be available in version for MS DOS Unix workstation among they HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly other platform by now I use the VMS version the PCI software consist of several class   group   package of utility group by function but all operate on a common pci database disk file the Tape I   o package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote sense industry tape format INTO or write those format out from the PCI database file- this be the only package I use or know much about other package can display datum from the PCI database to one or another of several pci support third party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image datum to an attached printer e.g. an Epson type dot matrix graphic printer you might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operation package histo- gram and Fourier analysis equalization user specify operation e.g. multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and God only know what all else there 's a LOT I do n't have and do n't use these so ca n't say much about them- you only buy the package your particular application   interest call for each utility be control by from one to eight parameter read from a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default directory some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing set up a series of operation the standard PCI environment contain a scripting language very similar to IBM pc BASIC but which allow you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility execution in VMS I can also invoke utility independently from a dcl command procedure There 's also an optional programming library which allow you to write compile language program which can interface with read from   write to the PCI datum structure database file parameter file the PCI software be design specifically for remote sense image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing as well for instance the Tape I   o package offer a utility for read headerless multi band what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh call raw datum from tape in a number of different interleave order this turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic art industry 's CT2 T format would probably I have n't try handle Targa and so on above all however you have to know what YOU'RE do or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over It 's worth note that the PCI database file be design to contain not only raster image datum but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land use and all manner of other information I observe that a remote sense image tape often contain all manner of information about the spectral band latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass- all of this can go into the PCI database I   believe   that on workstation the build in display be use on VAX system other than workstation pci support only a couple of specific third party display system the name Gould   Deanza seem to come to mind one of MY personal workaround be a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a Peritek VCT Q Q bus 24 bit DirectColor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case- it seems design for the very high end application   user i.e. those for whom a Mac   PC largely does n't suffice although as you know the gap be get small all the time It 's probably no coincidence that PCI be locate in Canada a country which do a LOT of its land   resource management via remote sensing- I believe the canadian government use PCI software for some of its work in these area SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager back in 1985 JPL develop something call SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager which get a fair amount of use at the time that be design for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery byte datum    256 pixel across by    512 line by    256 bands)- a modify version have since be develop for AVIRIS Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer which use much large image Spam do none of these thing rectification classification pc and IHS transformation filtering contrast enhancement overlay actually it do limit filtering and contrast enhancement stretching Spam be aim at spectral identification and clustering the original Spam use X or SunView to display the AVIRIS version may require VICAR an executive base on TAE and may also require a frame buffer I can refer you to people if you 're interested PCW require x for display

540;my theory be that Koresh be seriously wound in the initial gunbattle and die on Day 9 of the siege on Day 11 of the siege he rise from the dead and periodically appear to his follower and the FBI over the next 40 day live with someone who 's rise from the dead is n't easy as Timmy Baterman 's father in   petsematary   could attest so after 40 day they do what Baterman do shoot themselves and burn the place to the ground Consistent with the fact is n't it do anyone actually   see   Koresh between Day 9 and Day 11;3
541;someone from NASA post that there be very significant mass margin on the HST re boost mission a while back I have ask why not carry the EDO pallet up and the answer be the mass margin be tight enough they were n't even carry extra suit Where 's wingo when you need him:- come on knock that ST off you forget that during skylab they do overnight mission planning for the repair EVA 's also during the Intelsat Mission they do overnight WETF simulation I somehow think they could train up a new EVA in 8 month and as for build hardware anything can be build if you want it bad enough you forget the BUS 1 be already build all they 'd ahve to do be soup it up even test it on a delta mission do n't get into this mode of negativism besides at the rate mission slip the Discovery wo n't launch on this mission until March that be almost a year ah but how much more expensive be the second HST servicing mission you forget there be a bum FGS the Solar array electronic be get hinky and there be still 8 month until the servicing mission the time for the space walk be grow rapidly this be orignally plan out as 3 spacewalk now they be at 5 EVA 's with 3 reserve walk if the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that 's   500 million save if the Weight saving mean they can sit on orbit for 30 day and handle any contingency problem that be quite a saving of course there was n't any need for the Saturn v after apollo too as for the problem with the aperture door I be sure they can work out some way to handle that maybe a Plug make from Frozen ice it 'll keep out any contamination yet sublime away after teh boost;2

544;I disagree it think the average joe be interested   curious about spaceflight but see it as an elitist activity not one which he be ever go to participate in why be the general public go to be interested in the technical detail of long term space habitation I like the idea of the study but it should be release to other scientist and engineer who will be able to use it if you want a general public document you 'll need a more general publication as one work on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems engineer the microworld is n't the problem the problem be understand the basic chemical biological and medical factor to be able to engineer they efficiently for example the only way we know how to produce food be from plant and animal food synthesis be not very far advanced so we have to orbit a farm well that be obviously not very efficient so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plant hydroponically instead of use dirt this be where the engineering come in but new technology bring new basic question that we do n't have the answer to like in dirt we can grow tomato and lettuce right beside each other but in hydroponic it turn out that you ca n't do that the lettuce growth be stunt when it 's grow in the same hydroponic solution as tomato so now you have to consider what other plant be go to have similar interaction this mean some basic apply scientific research and that be what need to be do with all technology that have be develop so far we also need to find out how they interact together That 's where we be now first you need to do the literature search there be a lot of information out there maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation this could be useful especially if we make it available on the net then we can look at method of analyze the technology unless there be an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search first then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis the data base itself could be useful for future engineer That be my response Ken what do you think;2

565;sorry about the delay in respond due to conference paper deadline panic   alarm amount of agreement delete   that complicated is n't in fact where P(H   P(HG come from- it 's more the other way around It 's from P(H   P(HG   P(HG where G be the complement of G and by axiom p(anythe    0 so P(HG    0 so P(H    P(HG in a sense HG be necessarily more complicated than h for any h and G so I may be split hair but what I 'm try to say be that irrespective of subjective impression of how complicated something be P(H    P(HG hold with equality if and only if P(HG   0 well p(x   A   p(x   B mean that x be as likely to be observe if a be operative as it be if B be operative this imply that observe x do not provide any useful information which might allow we to discriminate between the respective possibility that A and B be operative- the difference reduce to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probability P(A and P(B p(x   A   p(x   B     P(A   x   k P(A and P(B   x   k P(B where k   p(x   a   P(x   p(x   B   P(x so A and B be equally consistent with the datum in that observe x does n't give any pointer as to which of A or B be operative in the particular case where a   h and b   HG however we know that their prior probability be order by P(H    P(HG although we do n't know the actual value and it 's this which allow we to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG That 's certainly true but the particular point here be whether or not a   divine component actually underlie the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of   spread the word now it seem to I as I 've say that the observed variance in religious belief be well account for by the memetic transmission model but rather   less   well if one propose a   divine component in addition since I would expect the latter to conspire   against   wide variance and even mutual exclusion among belief thus my   personal   feeling be that P(x   HG is n't even equal to P(x   H in this case but be small H be memetic transmission G be   divine component x be the variance among belief but I happily acknowledge that this be a subjective impression not that I 'm a statistician as such either but the idea be that both theism and atheism be compatible with all of the read   my observation to date however theism of the type with which I be concern   also   suggest that for instance prayer may be answer people may be miraculously heal both be in principle amenable to statistical verification and that god   s may generally intervene in measurable way this mean that these region of the space of possible observation which I loosely term appearance of god   s have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic since there be only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expend on make appearance of god   s possible must come from somewhere else i.e. other possible observation all else be equal this mean that an observation which   is n't   an appearance of god   s must have a slightly high probability under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff imply that such observation must cause my run estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis sorry if that be still a bit jargonesque but it 's rather difficult to put it any other way since it do depend intimately on the property of conditional probability density and particularly that the total area under they be always unity an analogy may or may not be helpful say that hypothesis A be the coin be fair and that B be the coin be unfair two headed I 've use A and b to avoid confusion with hhead   and ttail   then p(h   A   0.5   total 1 p(t   A   0.5   P(H   B   1   total 1 p(t   B   0   the observation be a string of head with no tail this be compatible with both a fair coin A and a two head coin B however the probability expend by a on make possible the appearance of tail even though they do n't actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it come in this case from the probability of the appearance of head say our running estimate at time n-1 be en-1(a and en-1(B the observation xn   at time n be another head xn    H. the estimate be modify accord to p(h   A en(A   en-1(a     en-1(a   m P(H and p(h   B en(B   en-1(b     en-1(b   2 m P(H now we do n't know P(H the   actual   prior probability of a head but the multipli for e(A be half that for e(B this be true every time the coin be toss and a head be observe thus whatever the initial value of the estimate after n head we have n en(A   m e0(a and n en(B   2 m e0(b and since ek(A   ek(b   1 at any time k you can show that 0.5   m   1 and thus 1   2 m   2 hence the estimate for the fair coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two head coin hypothesis B must increase even though both hypothesis be compatible with a string of head the loose analogy be between unfair coin and atheism and between fair coin and theism with observation consistent with both a tail which would falsify unfair coin be analogous to an appearance of god   s which would falsify atheism I be   not   claim that the analogy extend to the numerical value of the various probability just that the principle be the same quite so but this type of theism be what I might call the g in the HG in term of our ockham 's Razor discussion and i 'd bin it on those ground the hypothesis do n't have to be falsifiable and indeed in my   model the theism is n't falsifiable you do n't have to we do n't need in the above analogy to know   any   prior probability to deduce that the update multipli for the fair coin hypothesis be less than unity and that the correspond multipli for the two head coin hypothesis be great than unity you do n't need to know the initial value of the run estimate either It 's clear that after a large number of observation p(fair coin approach zero and p(two head coin approach unity all you need to know be whether p(x   Ha be large than P(x   Ht for observed x and this follow from the assumption that there be certain event render   possible   not necessary under Ht which be not possible under Ha and all else be equal any observation you like- it really does n't matter nor affect the reasoning provide that there be some possible observation which would count as appearance of god   s. Examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation OK we 'll downgrade   do   interact to   may   interact which would actually be well since do interact imply a falsifiability which we both agree be misplace I 'll explain but bear in mind that this is n't central- all I require of a theism be that it   not   make the prediction Appearances of god   s will never happen as do atheism before somebody point out that quantum mechanic does n't make this prediction either the difference be that QM and atheism do not form a partition prediction include such statement as Prayer be efficacious imply if you do the stat you will find that Prayer be efficacious or Prayer be   not   efficacious or verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these thing be fulfil I do n't think we have any problem of misunderstanding here That 's fine- I do n't claim that theism be false merely that the   finite number of   observation available to I so far suggest that it be and that as I continue to observe the suggestion look well and well I think you are- an appearance of god   s be sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the correspond theism be unfalsifiable no by way of a counterexample let x   the coin be fair or more accurately so that not(X make sense the two side of the coin be different this be unfalsifiable by toss the coin- even a string of head be consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of toss to falsify x in the limit its converse be falsifiable and be falsify when at least one head and at least one tail have appear oop sorry Mea culpa we agree here the rapture will not happen on October 28 1992 Said Rapture would have falsify atheism to my satisfaction have it happen although its failure to happen do not of course falsify any theism other than those which specifically predict it no phenomenon which require the existence of one or more god for its explanation will ever be observe that about sum the whole thing up cheer Simon;0

574;well the good thing to do be to read the book Parallel Universes by Dr. Fred Wolf in essence Dr. Wolf say that one interpretation of the sub atomic particle   wave duality be that what we perceive as a wave be actually an infinate number of parallel universe overlay and in each of these universe there be a particle in a different location when we do something to make a particle appear we be actually cause all the parallel universe to collapse into one apparently this be one line of thought on the nature of QM that be go through some of the scientific community Dr. Wolf and many other claim that somehow the collapse be cause by the mental effort of observe the particle this imply that mind be more than merely a biological phenomenon he then extrapolate that if mind be an integral part of the universe then perhaps consciousness be the element that give order and form to the universe(s it   themself(s it all get rather interesting but what I find facinate be that this would explain the phenomenon of magick as practice in my religion Dr. Wolf speculate that the ordering functionality of mind could be cause by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible futures- he say that this might be do by some sort of communication between one current and possible future self I have long speculate that if magick be not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be cause by some sort of a selection of one of many possible future I realize that this get pretty bizarre but it never hurt to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourselves after all the more we learn about the universe in which we live the more we learn that it be truly a very strange place;3

596;I 'm ask for help on a sticky problem involve unreasonably low apparent precision in Z buffering that I 've encounter in 2 different pex implementation I ca n't find any discussion of this problem in any resource I can lay hand on e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ Gaskins 's   PEXlibProgrammingManual   vendors documentation I 'm post this article by itself on comp.graphic and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrate the problem on comp.windows.x.pex the problem be hard to describe without picture hence this article be longish if you can run PEXlib 5.x program and be interested I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to deal with it it depend on the utility code from the above Gaskins book- instruction for fetch it via anonymous FTP be give the problem to be solve be to eliminate or minimize stitch artifact result from the use of z buffering with polyline that be coplanar with fill area the interpolate z value along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolate z value across an area even when the endpoint of the line be coincident with vertex of the area because of this it 's a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixel or the area pixel to be display visually the result tend to be a dash line effect even though the line be suppose to be solid use the PEXlib API my approach to a solution be to use two slightly different pex view mapping transform in two view table entry one for the area and one for the line the PEX structure or immediate- mode output must be organize so that one view table index be always in effect for area and the other be always in effect for line the result be a slight shift in NPC z coordinate for the line so as to attempt to bias the tossup situation in favor of the line this shift be effect by move the front and back clip plane use in the PEXlib view table entry for line just a hair backwards i.e. small VRC z coordinate compare to their position in the view table entry use for area this mean that when a point be transform to NPC its z value will be slightly big if it come from a line than if it come from an area thus accomplish the desire bias I would expect the z roundoff error which cause the problem to amount to a few unit at most out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 i.e. 16 or 24 bit z buffer therefore it seem that a tiny fraction of the range of z in VRC between the front and back clip plane ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching but in fact experience show that the shift have to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range empirically it 's bad when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface be high i.e. when it appear more or less edge on to the viewer It 's as if only 8 or 9 bit of the z buffer have any dependable meaning this amount be so great that one problem be replace by another sometimes the polyline show through area which they be suppose to lie behind I 've observe the problem on both Hewlett Packard and Digital workstation pex server to approximately the same degree the test program demonstrate the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation- this version be know to compile and run on an HP UX system with pex 5.1 open question 1 why do this happen be I configure the pex view table wrongly be there a systematic difference in z interpolation for line as oppose to area e.g. pixel center versus corner which could be correct for be pex implementor wantonly discard z precision in their interpolator something else 2 what to do about it can I fix my use of the view table to allow well precision in z buffer hlhsr be there another approach I can take to remove the stitch artifact be I just out of luck any help would be immensely appreciate;1
597;   what evidence indicate that Gamma Ray burster be very far away    give the enormous power I be just wonder what if they be    quantum black hole or something like that fairly close by    why would they have to be at galactic range David give good explaination of the deduction from the isotropic edged distribution to whit they be either part of the Universe or part of the Oort cloud why could n't they be Earth centre with the edge occur at the edge of the gravisphere I know there is n't any mechanism for they but there is n't a mechanism for the other either what on Earth be the gravisphere anyway before it 's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter have a gamma ray detector as do Ulysses they detect the bright burst that the Earth orbit detector do so the burst be at least at Oort cloud distance in principle four detector space out by a few AU would see parallax if the burst be of solar system origin   the   problem with Oort cloud source be that absolutely no plausible mechanism have be propose it would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell Closest to conventional Oort source be a model of b field pinch by comet it 's get too many hole in it to count but at least it be a good try;2

601;they were n't even carry extra suit so how much mass be save by not burn the OMS That be the critical question my data show that the OMS engine hold 10,900 kg of propellant of that a substantial fraction be go to be use for the first OMS burn the reentry burn and the reserve so Pat tell we how much fuel the altitude change be go to take and how much the EDO pallet BUS-1 and extra part be go mass if you can make the number work out   then   I 'll be interested after you show we that it can be do then tell we how much the EDO pallet BUS-1 and extra equipment be go to cost first while astronaut certainly have do eva with minimal planning that be because they   have   to they do n't like to do that as a general rule second remember why they have to improvise during Intelsat 6 they be try to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that was n't design to do that try to shortcut the training be only go to make a repeat more likely Third they do n't have eight month they have however much time be leave after someone come up with a plan show it can work and get it approve you may think I have a pessimistic attitude I think it 's realistic I 'm not say that the engineering task be impossible few engineering task be what I 'm say be that this be neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA management all they have to do be soup it up just what do that mean the second servicing mission be a contingency you have neither show that it would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your plan no Pat I have n't forget no Pat That 's   500 million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement cost minus extra operating cost TANSTAAFL I 'm sure that if you reread this you 'll see that your argument be falacious Pat not only be this messy and less reliable than a device that 's   make   to perform this task it also ignore the point there be a desire to have astronaut available so that if the door fail to open something can be do about it unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopen the door you have n't solve the problem;2
602;well I seem to have strike an interesting discussion off give that I be not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist i 'll have to boil it down a bit 1 all the datum on burst to date show a smooth random distribution 2 that mean they are n't concentrate in galactic core our or someone else 3 if the distribution be smooth we be either see some enormously large phenomenon scatter at the edge of the universe say phenomenon be subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena tor we be see some phenomenon out at like the Oort cloud but then it need some potent little energy source that is n't detectable by any other current method 4 we know it be not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurement on the burst 5 the burst seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impact or something like that so everyone be watch the datum and argue like mad in the meanwhile what I be wonder be this in people 's opinion a new Physics problem Einstein get well know for solvingthe photoelectric effect Copernicus start look at irregularity in planetary motion be this a big enough problem to create a new area of physic just a little speculative thinking folk;2

620;People who criticize big Government and its project rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology basically the U.S. Government have get into the role of support research which private industry find too expensive or too long term historically this role for the U.S. gov't be force upon it because of socialism in other country in order for U.S. industry to compete with government subsidize foreign competitor the U.S. gov't have take on the role of subisize big ticket or long lead RD as a Republican I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way I believe that market force should drive technology and the world would be a well place for it but the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously or some country would have subsidize RD while other would not so the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else do this sound a lot like the farm subsidy argument behind our GATT negotiation does n't it but this role of Government subsidy be antithetical to cost effectiveness the general idea be to spend money on new technology and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture despite the force in the business world like the dread quarterly earning report which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology and since our goal be to spend money it make little sense to try to save money of course we could always spend our money more wisely but EVERYBODY disagree about that the wisdom should be It 's interesting to note that some of our good tool for cost control available in industry today be derive from Government project gantt chart CP   M and most of the modern scheduling software come from DoD project and their contractor the construction industry have take these tool to the core of their businesses- every large construction project now use these tool Ken Jenks NASA   JSC   GM2 Space Shuttle Program Office kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov 713 483 4368;2

674;this do not propose a   mechanism   for grb in the Oort and no anti matter annihilation do not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra big difference That be ignore the question of how you fit a distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution be not well know in particular comet aphelia which be not well know be not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution merge neutron star be at least a mechanism with about the right energy except it does n't explain why there be no apparent correlation with galaxy or galaxy structure there be no mechanism for get all the energy out in gamma ray with any significant amount of baryon around there will be a lot of pair production which make a plasma which thermalize the energy it have trouble generate enough energy to explain the most powerful burst 10   52 53 erg it happen too fast compare to the burst duration and it be hard to make tight binary of neutron star another cosmological mechinism be the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange star but that use pretty far out physics my point be that we do n't have a good mechanism at any distance so GRB 's be likely to be happen by an unknown mechanism so we ca n't rule out the Oort cloud what would be the spectrum of an event which convert a comet to strange matter the spectra for primordial black hole eat comet and antimatter comet collide with matter comet are n't quite right but perhaps there be an unusual mechanism which modify the spectrum the energy match very well for both of these mechanism accord to Trevor Weeks if the Tunguska Meteorite be a mini black hole collision with the earth then there be likely to be enough mini black hole around that the rate for bh comet collision match the GRB rate well the fact that we do n't know the distribution of comet in the Oort cloud is n't a reason to rule they out- it make it hard to rule they out the point of the cite paper be that if we assume they get the right distribution for the Oort cloud it be hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB 's if they get the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud they ca n't constrain any oort- cloud GRB 's at all;2

680;  why not build a inflatable space dock if you 're do large scale satellite servicing be able to do it in a pressurized hangar make considerable sense the question be whether anyone be go to be do large scale satellite servicing in the near future to the point of justify development of such a thing That be a mighty fine idea but since you ask why not I 'll respond put aside the application of such a space dock there be other factor to consider than just pressurize volume temperature control be difficult in space and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation maybe a double walled inflatable Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection be also require do n't think this will be a clear plastic bubble- it 's more likely to look like a big white ball make out of the same kind of multi layer fabric that soft torso space suit be make out of today because almost all manned space vessel Skylab Mir Salyut use their pressurization for increase structural rigidity even though they have have metal skin they still kind of qualify as inflatable the inflation process would have to be carefully control the space environment reduce ductility in expose material due to temperature extreme monotomic Oxygen impingement and radiation effect on material so your fabric may not retain any flexibility for long this may not matter even after inflation pressure change in the hangar may cause flex in the fabric which could lead to hole and tear as ductility decrease these be some of the technical difficulty which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station deal with to vary degree of success Ken Jenks NASA   JSC   GM2 Space Shuttle Program Office kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov 713 483 4368;2

682;  there be actually some talk.abortion relate comment below believe it or not   well if our observer x be as likely to be in A 's position as B 's and if he agree that both A and B be make appropriate observation and inference regard the situation then I would expect he to conclude that there be no right answer hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow he to make some judgement regard which answer to accept if on the other hand he disagree with the principle of either A or B I suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one it be unfortunately the case that not all moral argument have answer from all perspective for instance I be completely unable to come to any conclusion regard whether abortion should be allow or not from my perspective in an ideal world all live thing would have a right to life- but in an ideal world woman would have the absolute right to do what they like with their own body clearly there be no way to resolve in favour of both these principle therefore I agree with the compromise solution of allow abortion up to a certain time after conception and decide on the time base on various sometimes ill define criterion this be also a sensible move I think because it let people make their own decision within reason and for what it 's worth I be reasonably happy with current UK abortion law similarly the situation in what 's leave of Yugoslavia be a horrible mess and I really ca n't see my way to any sort of conclusion there I do n't even know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage;3
683;this be a good question there be major blind spot in our understanding of what make the earth habitable for example why do the earth 's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it do the naive answer be photosynthesis but this be clearly incomplete photosynthesis by itself ca n't make the atmosphere oxygenate as the oxygen produce be consume when the plant decay or be eat what be need be photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the result reduce material on earth this mechanism be burial in seafloor sediment of organic matter mostly from oceanic source however this burial require continental sediment in the deep ocean the burial rate be so slow that most material be consume before it can be sequester this suggest that a planet without large ocean or a planet without continent undergo weathering will have a hard time accumulate an oxygen atmosphere in particular an all ocean planet may have a hard time support an oxygen atmosphere there be also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth 's atmosphere have be relatively stable over geological time for a period at least 2 order of magnitude long than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weather in the absence of replenishment no convincing feedback mechanism have be identify perhaps the reason be the weak anthropic principle if during the last 500 MYr or so the oxygen level have drop too low we would n't be here to be wonder about it;2

712;if what be be discuss could be establish or disproven by experiment and observation then I would agree with you Chris the burden of proof would belong to Bill but the source document for Christianity the Bible simply assume God exist and make it clear to we Calvinists anyway that when a person be in fellowship with God it be because God have take the initiative in reveal himself to that person so from a christian point of view the burden of proof belong to God Bill be be consistent with what the Bible teach in relate his own experience with God but it would be an error on his part to assume that there be a direct causal relationship between his testimony and someone else become convince that God exist and that he need to be reconcile to God please excuse I if I miss an early part of this thread in which Bill come across like an egotist what I see be simply obedience to the scriptural command to always be ready to give a reason for the joy that be in you;3

Group the original name of the committee that write the standard JPEG be design for compress either full color or gray scale digital image of natural real world scene it do not work so well on non realistic image such as cartoon or line drawing JPEG do not handle black and white 1 bit per pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression standard for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name JBIG and mpeg respectively JPEG be lossy mean that the image you get out of decompression is n't quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieve much of its compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail are n't perceive as well as small detail of light and dark thus JPEG be intend for compress image that will be look at by human if you plan to machine analyze your image the small error introduce by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye a useful property of JPEG be that the degree of lossiness can be vary by adjust compression parameter this mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make   extremely   small file if you do n't mind poor quality- this be useful for indexing image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc conversely if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept less compression   2   why use JPEG there be two good reason to make your image file small and to store 24 bit per pixel color datum instead of 8 bit per pixel datum make image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archiving library of image be able to compress a 2 mbyte full color file down to 100 Kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you be compare GIF and JPEG the size ratio be more like four to one More detail below if your view software does n't support JPEG directly you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for view or manipulating image even with a jpeg capable viewer it take long to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simple format GIF for instance thus use JPEG be essentially a time   space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply It 's worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a short file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format be that JPEG can store full color information 24 bit   pixel 16 million color instead of 8 or less 256 or few color if you have only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of year though 8 bit GIF will look as obsolete as black and white MacPaint format do today furthermore for reason detail in section 7 JPEG be far more useful than GIF for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware hence JPEG be considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet post standard   3   when should I use jpeg and when should I stick with GIF JPEG be   not   go to displace GIF entirely- for some type of image GIF be superior in image quality file size or both one of the first thing to learn about JPEG be which kind of image to apply it to as a rule of thumb JPEG be superior to GIF for store full color or gray scale image of realistic scenes- that mean scan photograph and similar material JPEG be superior even if you do n't have 24 bit display hardware and it be a LOT superior if you do see section 7 for detail GIF do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such as cartoon and line drawing in particular large area of pixel that be all   exactly   the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by GIF JPEG ca n't squeeze these file as much as GIF do without introduce visible defect this sort of image be well keep in GIF form in particular single color border be quite cheap in GIF file but they should be avoid in JPEG file JPEG also have a hard time with very sharp edge a row of pure black pixel adjacent to a row of pure white pixel for example sharp edge tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing be not find in scanned photograph but it show up fairly often in GIF file border overlaid text etc the blurriness be particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixel high if you have a GIF with a lot of small size overlaid text do n't jpeg it computer draw image ray trace scene for instance usually fall between scanned image and cartoon in term of complexity the more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it the same go for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such plain black and white two level image should never be convert to JPEG you need at least about 16 gray level before JPEG be useful for gray scale image it should also be note that GIF be lossless for gray scale image of up to 256 level while JPEG be not if you have an exist library of GIF image you may wonder whether you should convert they to JPEG you will lose a little image quality if you do section 7 which argue that jpeg image quality be superior to GIF only apply if both format start from a full color original if you start from a GIF you 've already irretrievably lose a great deal of information- jpeg can only make thing bad however the disk space saving may justify convert anyway this be a decision you 'll have to make for yourself if you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hint be prepared to leave some image in GIF format since some gif will not convert well   4   how well do JPEG compress image pretty darn well here be some sample file size for an image I have handy a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three file be for comparison purposes- the rest be create with the free jpeg software describe in section 6B. filet Size in bytesttcomment ship.ppmt1145040 original file in PPM format no compression- 24 bit ttt or 3 byte per pixel plus a few byte overhead ship.ppm Zt 963829 PPM file pass through Unix compress ttt compress does n't accomplish a lot you 'll note ttt other text orient compressor give similar result ship.gift 240438 convert to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256   ppmtogif ttt Most of the saving be the result of lose color ttt info GIF save 8

this ship.jpg5ot 6587 cjpeg -q 5 -optimize -optimize cut table overhead ttt Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or ttt indexing purpose note that this file be TINY ttt the compression ratio from the original be 173:1 in this case jpeg can make a file that be a factor of four or five small than a GIF of comparable quality the -q 75 file be every bit as good as the GIF well if you have a full color display this seem to be a typical ratio for real world scene   5   what be good quality setting for jpeg Most jpeg compressor let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by select a quality setting there seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting Quality 95 do not mean keep 95 of the information as some have claim the quality scale be purely arbitrary- it be not a percentage of anything the name of the game in use JPEG be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompress into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb the default quality setting -Q 75 be very often the good choice this setting be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image try -q 75 first- if you see defect then go up except for experimental purpose never go above -Q 95- say -Q 100 will produce a file two or three time as large as -Q 95 but of hardly any well quality if the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a high quality set to avoid further degradation the second case seem to apply much of the time when convert gif to JPEG the default -Q 75 be about right for compress 24 bit image but -Q 85 to 95 be usually well for convert gif see section 14 for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a -q setting in the range of 5 to 10 be about right -Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art note the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free jpeg software describe in section 6b and to many program base on it other jpeg implementation such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some program do n't even provide a numeric scale just high   medium   low style choice   6   where can I get JPEG software Most of the program describe in this section be available by FTP if you do n't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article how to find source if you do n't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail server in the same article that article appear regularly in news.answer or you can get it by send e mail to mail-serverrtfm.mit.edu with send usenet   news.answer   finding source in the body the Anonymous FTP List FAQ may also be helpful it 's usenet   news.answer   ftp list   faq in the news.answer archive note this list change constantly if you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late JPEG FAQ from the news.answer archive   6a   if you be look for can software viewer etc the first part of this list be system specific program that only run on one kind of system if you do n't see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software describe at the end of the list note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over Internet- but some commercial program be list too X Windows XV shareware   25 be an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other image format it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulation It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu 18.24.0.12 file contrib   xv-3.00.tar Z. Version 3.00 be a major upgrade with support for 24 bit display and many other improvements- however it be brand new and still have some bug lurk if you prefer not to be on the bleed edge stick with version 2.21 also available from export note that version 2.21 be not a good choice if you have a 24 bit display you 'll get only 8 bit color nor for convert 24 bit image to JPEG but 2.21 work fine for convert GIF and other 8 bit image to JPEG caution there be a glitch in version 2.21 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when save a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x Windows be John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package also available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   ImageMagick.tar Z. this package handle many image processing and conversion task the ImageMagick viewer handle 24 bit display correctly- for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software both of the above be large complex package if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support JPEG in its late release 3.03 xloadimage be free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xloadimage-3.03.tar Z. xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by its fan to be somewhat fast and more robust than the original the current xli be indeed fast and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg file because it have the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 be use a hack over v1 the next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu file contrib   xli.1.14.tar Z. both program be say to do the right thing with 24 bit display MS DOS this cover plain dos- for Windows or os2 program see the next heading one good choice be Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG which view JPEG and GIF file the current version 2.5 be available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca 129.97.50.50 file pub   jpeg   viewer   dvpeg25.zip this be a good basic viewer that work on either 286 or 386486 machine the user interface be not flashy but it 's functional another freeware JPEG   GIF   TGA viewer be Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview the current version 1.2 be available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   hv12.zip Hiview require a 386 or well cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager QEMM386 and 386max work- Windows and os2 do not Hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen for large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning   scroll as most viewer do you may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no deny that it slow down loading of large image considerably note installation be a bit tricky- read the direction carefully a shareware alternative be ColorView for DOS   30 this be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative its user interface be also much spiffier look although personally I find it hard to use more keystroke inconsistent behavior it be fast than DVPEG but a little slow than Hiview at least on my hardware for image large than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both be fast than Hiview the current version be 2.1 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   dcview21.zip require a vesa graphic driver- if you do n't have one look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory many recent pc have a build in vesa driver so do n't try to load a vesa driver unless ColorView complain that the driver be miss a second shareware alternative be Fullview which have be kick around the net for a while but I do n't know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway the author tell I that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the Simtel20 archive at that time the well know GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW support JPEG in its late revision 8.60a however CSHOW 's jpeg implementation is n't very good it 's slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi color display too bad it 'd have be nice to see a good jpeg capability in CSHOW Shareware   25 available from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   gif   cshw860a.zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphic hardware any one of these viewer might not work on your particular machine if you ca n't get   any   of they to work you 'll need to use one of the following conversion program to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer if you have hi color hardware do n't use GIF as the intermediate format- try to find a targa capable viewer instead VPIC5.0 be repute to do the right thing with hi color display the Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converter be ftpable from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   jpeg4.zip or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory these file be DOS compilation of the free source code describe in section 6b- they will convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM format Handmade Software offer free JPEGGIF conversion tool GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF these be slow and be limit to conversion to and from GIF format- in particular you ca n't get 24 bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tool be that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary jpeg format as well as the Usenet standard JFIF format since HSI format file be rather widespread on BBSes this be a useful capability Version 2.0 of these tool be free prior version be shareware get it from Simtel20 and mirror site see NOTE below file msdo   graphic   gif2jpg2.zip note do not use HSI format for file to be post on Internet since it

document refer to directory eg msdo   graphic at Simtel20 that really mean pd1 msdos.graphics   if you be not physically on MILnet you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rate from Simtel20 there be several internet site that maintain copy mirror of the Simtel20 archives- most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site instead a popular USA mirror site be oak.oakland.edu 141.210.10.117 which keep Simtel20 file in eg pub   msdo   graphic if you have no FTP capability you can retrieve file from Simtel20 by e mail- see informational posting in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how if you be outside the USA consult the same newsgroup to learn where your near Simtel20 mirror be Microsoft Windows there be several Windows program capable of display JPEG image Windows viewer be generally slow than DOS viewer on the same hardware due to Windows system overhead note that you can run the DOS conversion program describe above inside a Windows DOS window the new entry be WinECJ which be free and EXTREMELY fast Version 1.0 be available from ftp.rahul.net file pub   bryanw   pc   jpeg   wecj.zip require Windows 3.1 and 256 or more color mode this be a no frill viewer with the bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decodes- and the image quality be noticeably bad than other viewer but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway at least for previewing JView be freeware fairly fast have good on line help and can write out the decompress image in Windows BMP format- but it ca n't create new jpeg file and it does n't view gif JView also lack some other useful feature of the shareware viewer such as brightness adjustment but it be an excellent basic viewer the current version 0.9 be available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu 129.79.20.84 file pub   pc   win3   desktop

Macintosh Most Mac jpeg program rely on Apple 's jpeg implementation which be part of the QuickTime system extension- so you need to have quicktime instal to use QuickTime you need a 68020 or well cpu and you need to be run System 6.0.7 or later if you 're run System 6 you must also install the 32 bit QuickDraw extension- this be build in on System 7 you can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   quicktime.hqx as of 1192 this file contain QuickTime 1.5 which be well than QT 1.0 in several way with respect to jpeg it be marginally fast and considerably less prone to crash when feed a corrupt jpeg file however some application seem to have compatibility problem with QT 1.5 Mac user should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format PICT   JPEG be not the same as the Usenet standard JFIF JPEG format see section 10 for detail if you post image on Usenet make sure they be in JFIF format Most of the program mention below can generate either format the first choice be probably jpegview a free program for view image that be in JFIF format PICT   JPEG format or GIF format it also can convert between the two JPEG format the current version 2.0 be a big improvement over prior version get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu 36.44.0.6 file info mac   app   jpeg view-20.hqx require System 7 and QuickTime on 8 bit display jpegview usually produce the good color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewer jpegview can view large image in much less memory than other Mac viewers- in fact it 's the only one that can deal with jpeg image much over 640x480 pixel on a typical 4 MB Mac give a large image jpegview automatically scale it down to fit on the screen rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer you can zoom in on any desire portion though some people like this behavior some do n't Overall JPEGView 's user interface be very well think out GIFConverter a shareware   40 image viewer   converter support JFIF and PICT   JPEG as well as GIF and several other image format the late version be 2.3.2 get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   art   gif   gif converter-232.hqx Requires System 6.0.5 or later GIFConverter be not well than JPEGView as a plain jpeg   GIF viewer but it have much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image also the new version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF image   without   QuickTime so it be your good bet if your machine be too old to run QuickTime but it 's fast with QuickTime note if GIFConverter run out of memory try to load a large jpeg try convert the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then view the GIF version JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utility be available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   jpeg convert-10.hqx this will run on any Mac but it only do file conversion not view you can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer previous version of this FAQ recommend Imagery JPEG v0.6 a JPEGGIF converter base on an old version of the IJG code if you be use this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert Apple 's free program PictPixie can view image in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these format you can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com file dts   mac   quicktime   qt.1.0.stuff   pictpixie.hqx require QuickTime PictPixie be intend as a developer 's tool and it 's really not the good choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime some of its drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface bad PictPixie be an unsupported program mean it have some minor bug that Apple do not intend to fix there be an old version of PictPixie call PICTCompressor float around the net if you have this you should trash it as it 's even buggy also the QuickTime Starter Kit include a much clean up descendant of PictPixie call Picture Compressor note that Picture Compressor be not free and may not be distribute on the net storm technology 's Picture Decompress be a free JPEG viewer   converter this rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be force to use it on old system it do need 32 bit QuickDraw so really old machine ca n't use it you can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu file info mac   app   picture decompress-201.hqx you must set the file type of a download image file to jpeg to allow Picture Decompress to open it if your machine be too old to run 32 bit QuickDraw a Mac plus for instance GIFConverter be your only choice for single program JPEG view if you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer More and more commercial Mac application be support jpeg although not all can deal with the Usenet standard JFIF format Adobe Photoshop version 2.0.1 or later can read and write JFIF format jpeg file use the JPEG plug in from the Acquire menu you must set the file type of a download jpeg

appreciate Acorn Archimedes changefsi supply with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format provision be also make to convert image to JPEG although this must be do from the CLI rather than by double clicking recent version since 7.11 of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg along with about 30 other image format while old version can be find on some Archimedes bboard the current version be only available by register with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink 31 7544 WJ Enschede the Netherlands price 35 dutch guilde about   22 or 10 pound There 's also a commercial product call jpeg which provide JPEG read   write functionality and direct jpeg viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing option this be more expensive but not necessarily well than the above program contact DT Software FREEPOST Cambridge UK Tel 0223 841099 NeXT ImageViewer be a pd utility that display image and can do some format conversion the current version read JPEG but do not write it ImageViewer be available from the standard NeXT archive at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu somewhere in pub   next both be currently be re organized so it 's hard to point to specific sub directory note that there be an old version float around that do not support jpeg portable software for almost any system if none of the above fit your situation you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software describe in 6b You 'll also need a viewer program if your display be 8 bit or less any GIF viewer will do fine- if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24 bit image file there be numerous commercial jpeg offering with more pop up every day I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assist product ask pointed question about whether the product comply with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format- many of the early commercial release be not and never will be compatible with anyone else 's file   6b   if you be look for source code

quantization Most people do n't have full color 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 or few bit per pixel so it can display 256 or few distinct color at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color this process be call color quantization this be something of a misnomer color selection would be a well term we 're stick with the standard usage though clearly color quantization be a lossy process it turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by JPEG except at the very low jpeg quality setting since JPEG be a full color format convert a color jpeg image for display on 8 bit or less hardware require color quantization this be true for   all   color jpeg even if you feed a 256 or less color GIF into JPEG what come out of the decompressor be   not   256 color but thousand of color this happen because JPEG 's lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color each original color get smear into a group of nearby color therefore quantization be always require to display a color jpeg on a colormappe display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a JPEG image even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference I occasionally see post image describe as 256 color jpeg this tell I that the poster a has n't read this FAQ and b probably convert the jpeg from a GIF jpeg can be classify as color or gray scale just like photograph but number of color just is n't a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a GIF image by definition have already be quantize to 256 or few color a GIF   do   have a definite number of color in its palette and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entry for purpose of Usenet picture distribution GIF have the advantage that the sender precompute the color quantization so recipient do n't have to this be also the   disadvantage   of GIF you 're stick with the sender 's quantization if the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re quantize result in much poor image quality than if you have quantize once from a full color image furthermore if the sender did n't use a high quality color quantization algorithm you 're out of luck for this reason JPEG offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine do n't match the sender 's display hardware JPEG 's full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user 's display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of jpeg image you already have with a GIF you 're stick forevermore with what be send It 's also worth mention that many GIF view program include rather shoddy quantization routine if you view a 256 color GIF on a 16 color EGA display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to this be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the GIF one to display it but often it be also due to sloppiness JPEG conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizer in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be display thus JPEG be likely to provide well result than the average GIF program for low color resolution display as well as high resolution one finally an ever grow number of people have well than-8 bit display hardware already 15 bit hi color pc display true 24 bit display on workstation and macintosh etc for these people GIF be already obsolete as it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display jpeg image can drive these display much more effectively thus JPEG be an all around well choice than GIF for represent image in a machine independent fashion   8   how do jpeg work the buzz word to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transform coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article 's long enough already so i 'm not go to say more than that here for technical information see the comp.compression FAQ this be available from the news.answer archive at rtfm.mit.edu in file pub   usenet   news.answer   compression faq   part1 3   if you need help in use the news.answer archive see the top of this article   9   what about lossless jpeg There be a great deal of confusion on this subject the JPEG committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i.e. one that guarantee the final output be bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offer much less compression at present very few implementation of lossless JPEG exist and all of they be commercial say -q 100 to the free jpeg software do not get you a lossless image what it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsample step with the v4 free JPEG code you can also say -sample 1x1 to turn off subsample keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementation can not cope with the result file even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular JPEG algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation the maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value- it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit for bit accuracy if you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than 6 bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard this perform well than jpeg lossless on such image JPEG lossless be superior to JBIG on image with 6 or more bit per pixel- furthermore JPEG be public domain at least with a Huffman back end while the JBIG technique be heavily cover by patent   10   why all the argument about file format strictly speak JPEG refer only to a family of compression algorithms- it do   not   refer to a specific image file format the JPEG committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization since we ca n't actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leave we with a problem in the absence of official standard a number of jpeg program writer have just go off to do their own thing and as a result their program are n't compatible with anybody else 's the close thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format be some work that be be coordinate by people at C Cube Microsystems they have define two jpeg base file format   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a low end format that transport pixel and not much else   tiff   JPEG aka TIFF 6.0 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format TIFF be a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides TIFF be a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of TIFF It 's not likely that add jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these format be develop with input from all the major vendor of jpeg relate products- it 's reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture posting JFIF be simple than TIFF and be available now- the TIFF 6.0 spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail even when TIFF   JPEG be well define the JFIF format be likely to be a widely support low common denominator- tiff   jpeg file may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in be Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh QuickTime use a JFIF compatible format wrap inside the Mac specific pict structure conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG be pretty straightforward and several Mac program be available to do it see Mac portion of section 6a if you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a QuickTime jpeg PICT down to JFIF by hand- see section 11 for detail another particular case be Handmade Software 's program GIF2JPG   JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy these program be capable of read and write JFIF format by default though they write a proprietary format develop by HSI this format be not readable by any non hsi program and should not be use for Usenet posting use the -j switch to get JFIF output this apply to old version of these programs- the current release emit JFIF format by default you still should be careful not to post HSI format file unless you want to get flame by people on non pc platform   11   how do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wo n't read it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary jpeg base format you can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file 1 a JFIF standard file will start with the character hex FF d8 FF E0 follow by two variable byte often hex 00 10 follow by jfif 2 if you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this be probably decodable as be by JFIF software it 's worth a try anyway 3 HSI file start with hsi1 You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software portion of the file may look like plain jpeg datum but they wo n't decompress properly with non hsi program 4 a Macintosh pict file if jpeg compress will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a JFIF header scan for JFIF strip off everything before the FF d8 and you should be able to read it 5 anything else it 's a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG datum stream if you can identify the start of the JPEG datum stream look for FF D8 try strip off everything before that in uuencoded Usenet posting the characteristic JFIF pattern be tbegin line tmcx whereas uuencoded HSI file will start with tbegin line tm:'-i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non jfif file   12   what about arithmetic coding the JPEG spec define two different back end module for the final output of compress datum either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding be allow the choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produce a small compressed file on typical image arithmetic coding produce a file 5 or 10 percent small than Huffman code all the file size number previously cite be for Huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specify by the JPEG standard be subject to patent own by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi thus   you can not legally use arithmetic coding   unless you obtain license from these company the fair use doctrine allow people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at well at least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding- the space saving is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassle in particular arithmetic coding   should not   be use for any image to be exchange on Usenet there be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tune for further detail   13   do loss accumulate with repeat compression   decompression it would be nice if having compress an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lose initially unfortunately this be not the case in general recompresse an altered image lose more information though usually not as much as be lose the first time around the next good thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it   without change it   then there be no further loss i.e. you get an identical jpeg file even this be not true- at least not with the current free JPEG software It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first generation output it usually take many such cycle to get visible change one of the thing on our to do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limit but I be not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guarantee would be that compress the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple change as crop off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you 're wonder why it 's because the pixel block boundary move if you crop off only multiple of 16 pixel you might be safe but that be a mighty limited capability the bottom line be that JPEG be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step use a lossless format PPM RLE TIFF etc while work on the image then jpeg it when you be ready to file it away aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression   decompression time this way   14   what be some rule of thumb for convert GIF image to jpeg as state early you   will   lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist GIF image to JPEG if you can obtain the original full color datum the GIF be make from it 's far well to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality the first rule when convert a GIF library be to look at each jpeg to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond gif- that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary some gif may be well leave as GIFs as explain in section 3- in particular cartoon type GIFs with sixteen or few color do n't convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be   large   than the GIF so check the size too experience to date suggest that large high visual quality gif be the good candidate for conversion to JPEG they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to JPEG with least degradation do n't waste your time convert any GIF much under 100 Kbytes also do n't expect jpeg file convert from GIFs to be as small as those create directly from full color original to maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg file would be i.e. shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the GIF file not 14th as suggest in early comparison many people have develop an odd habit of put a large constant color border around a GIF image while useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in GIF file it be not free in jpeg file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact ghost edge do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpege if you be on an x Windows system XV 's manual and automatic cropping function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default q setting of 75 be appropriate for full color input but for GIF input q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggest below the high Q setting may not be necessary Color gif of photograph or complex artwork be usually dither to fool your eye into see more than the 256 color that GIF can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different colors- at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dither be that to JPEG it look like high spatial frequency color noise- and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have get from jpege the original full color image if you have it to get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression smooth average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you think you see anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color change that give JPEG trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid use a high q factor thus far reduce the size of the compressed file while still obtain a well look output image than you 'd get without smooth with the v4 free JPEG software or product base on it a simple smoothing capability be build in try -smooth 10 or so when convert gif value of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gif heavy handed dithering may require large smoothing factor if you can see regular fine scale pattern on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smoothing be definitely call for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you do n't want if you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package however cjpeg 's build in smoother be a LOT fast than pnmconvol the upshot of all this be that cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 be probably a good starting point for convert GIFs but if you really care about the image you 'll want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting for more information about JPEG in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-infouunet.uu.net;1

753;              this be quite different from say employ force on other people         be immoral period unfortunately from time to time we be oblige         to do this immoral thing for reason of self preservation and so         we have to bear the moral consequence of that              since both statement to all intent and purpose say effectively        the same thing          be you serious two statement one of which say that use of force      in the give situation be moral and the other of which say it be      not moral say effectively the same thing        yes when you tag on the Unfortunately then to all intent and     purpose you be say the same thing    then delete the unfortunately now tell I that the two statement   say effectively the same thing    and to save everyone a couple of trip round this loop please notice   that we be only oblige to use force to preserve self we can choose    not   to preserve self which be the point of pacifism O.K. get you I concede your point though the word oblige strongly imply that one must sometimes use force a further rephrasing would give you the distinction you mention however if I have you right a pacifist would not even go on to say unfortunately etc      would you say this of any two statement one say x be moral and      the other say X be immoral how would you decide when two      statement X be moral x be immoral actually conflict and when      they say effectively the same thing        what they prescribe that one should do be a pretty good indicator    and in this case they do n't prescribe the same thing so yes fair enough though why confuse thing by say that one be somtime oblige if the real meaning be that one be never oblige        and lead one to do precisely the same thing then        either both statement be doublespeak or none          they might lead you to do the same thing but the difference be what      motivate pacifism so they obviously do n't lead pacifist to to the      same thing        That be not true you could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum     force and still be a pacifist if the minimum be 0 great but one be     always try to get as close to 0 force as possible under that belief     not the same as force be immoral period but still tend to pacifism    if you do n't think the use of force be immoral why minimise its use if you do n't think that it be immoral period;3

Davidson 1977 water be pump by an IMPELLER pump through a LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL shape coil of tubing until it reach a CRITICAL VELOCITY the water then IMPLODES no long touch the inside wall of the tubing and drive the pump which then convert the pump 's motor into an ELECTRIC GENERATOR the device seem to be tap energy from that of the earth 's rotation via the Coriolis effect like a tornado   it can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY   a fourth type of Free Energy Device be the McClintock Air Motor U.S. patent   2,982,261 which be a cross between a diesel engine it have three cylinder with a compression ratio of 27 to 1 and a rotary engine with solar and planetary gear it burn no fuel but become self run by drive its own air compressor this engine also generate a lot of heat which could be use to heat buildings- and its very high torque make it ideal for large truck prevent their slow down when climb hill   David McClintock be also the REAL original Inventor of the automatic transmission differential and 4 wheel drive   crystal may someday be use to supply energy as show in the Star Trek show perhaps by insert each one between metal capacitor plate and bombard it with a beam of particle from a small radioactive source like that use in a common household smoke detector one other energy source should be mention here despite the fact that it do not fit the definition of Free Energy a Bulgarian bear American Physicist name Joseph Maglich have invent and partially develop an atomic FUSION reactor which he call Migma which use non radioactive deuterium as a fuel   available in nearly unlimited quantity from sea water   do not produce radioactive waste can be convert DIRECTLY into electricity with out energy waste steam turbine and can be construct small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city and unlike the Tokamaks and laser fusion monstrositie that we read about Migma WORKS already produce at least three watt of power for every watt put in   New Times U.S. version 6 26 78 page 32 40   and then there be the cold fusion experiment that have be in the news lately originally conduct by University of Utah researcher B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann some U.S. Navy researcher at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in California under the direction of chemist Melvin Miles finally take the trouble to collect the bubble come from such an apparatus have they analyze with mass spectrometry technique and find HELIUM 4 which prove that atomic FUSION do indeed take place and enough of it to explain the excess heat generate there be good INDICATIONS that the two so call law of thermodynamic be not so absolute for example the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson develop a comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe which he call the reciprocal System which he describe in detail in several book such as Nothing but Motion 1979 and the Universe of Motion 1984 in which the physical universe have two distinct HALVES the material half and an anti matter half with a CONTINUOUS cycle of matter and energy pass between they with out the heat death predict by thermodynamic law his theory explain the universe MUCH well than modern orthodox theory include phenomenon that orthodox physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about and be self consistent in every way some Free Energy Devices might be tap into that energy flow seemingly convert low quality energy into high quality energy also certain religious organization such as sant Mat and Eckankar teach their member that the physical universe be only the lowest of at least a DOZEN major level of existence like parallel universe or analogous to tv channel as describe in book like the Path of the Masters by Dr. Julian Johnson 1939 and Eckankar the Key to Secret Worlds by Sri Paul Twitchell 1969 for example the next level up from the physical universe be commonly call the astral Plane long time member of these group have learn to soul Travel into these high world and report on condition there it seem plausible that energy could flow down from these high level into the physical universe or be create at the boundary between they give the right configuration of matter to channel it this be support by many successful laboratory control experiment in PSYCHO KINESIS throughout the world such as those describe in the book Psychic Discoveries behind the Iron Curtain in term of economic the market have fail inventor do not have enough money and other resource to fully develop and mass produce Free Energy Equipment and the conventional energy producer have no desire to do so because of their VETED interet the government be need to intervene if the government do not intervene then the total supply of energy resource from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out price for energy will increase and pollution and its harmful effect include the GREENHOUSE effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spill rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue to increase the government should SUBSIDIZE research and development of Free Energy by Inventors and university subsidize private production until the producer can make it on their own and subsidize consumption by low income consumer of Free Energy Hardware the long range effect of such government intervention would be wide spread and profound the quantity of energy demand from conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie and country electric utilitie etc would drop to near zero force their employee to seek work elsewhere energy resource coal uranium oil and gas would be leave in the ground price for conventional energy supply would also drop to near zero while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high but drop as supply increase as happen with VCR 's personal computer etc cost of produce product that require large quantity of energy to produce would decrease along with their price to consumer consumer would be able to realize the opportunity cost of pay electric utility bill or buy home heating fuel Tourism would benefit and increase because traveler would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their car Government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuel would have to be obtain in some other way and ENERGY could no long be use as a motive or excuse for make WAR many conventional energy producer would go out of business but society as a whole and the earth 's environment and ecosystem would benefit greatly it be the People that government should serve rather than the big corporation and bank for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited source patent article book UN altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this IMPORTANT information be encouraged;0

useless now if you have want to get right with God before the rapture you could have but you choose to wait now your only chance be to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the Tribulation but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be save Matthew 24:13 II realize you be now live during the great tribulation tThe Great Tribulation be a seven year period start from the time of the rapture until Christ 's second coming also know as the time of Jacob 's Israel 's trouble Jere 30:7 and Daniel 's Seventieth Week Dan 9 this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror III GATHER as many bible as you can and hide they tSoon after the Antichrist become the leader of the European Community the revive Roman Empire bible will be confiscate and own a Bible will be tantamount to treason the Bible however will be your most valuable possession during the Tribulation IV READ the BIBLE like you have never READ it before in your life tsince all of your bible may be confiscate even if you be careful it be imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passage and can quote they it be especially important to read Daniel Luke 21 Matthew 24 Revelation and Amos for these book describe the event you can expect to unfold before you V. pray like you have never pray before in your life tpray until the power of God come strongly upon you pray and pray and pray only by read the Word and pray will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ VI do not take the mark AT any cost even in FIT means you and your loved ONES DIE as MARTYRS tAfter the Antichrist become the leader of the European Community he will institute a world economic system design so that you can not buy sell or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name Money will be useless and he cause all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead and that no one may buy or sell except one who have the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here be wisdom let he who have understanding calculate the number of the beast for it be the number of a man his number be 666 Revelation 13:16 18 tthe Antichrist will implement the great slaughter in all of humanity think of the various way people have be torture and kill in the past such as the Holocaust   or maybe the crusade -m   you can not even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist 's rule- it will be much bad than anything in history Matt 24:21 I see under the altar the soul of those who have be slay for the word of God and for the testimony which they hold and a white robe be give to each of they and it be say to they that they should rest a little while long until both the number of the fellow servant and their brother who would be kill as they be be complete revelation 6:9 11 tHis target will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn and I see the soul of those who have be behead for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God who have not worship the beast or his image and have not receive his mark on their forehead or on the hand Revelation 20:4 he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ nor will he hesitate to use your love one against you even your child torture and kill they in front of you so that you will be tempt to take the mark tif you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image however you will be consign to the second death which be the Lake of Fire   Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash -m   you can not be redeem it be well to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then   sic   to endure eternal torment in the RingHHHH Lake of Fire if anyone worship the Beast and his image and receive his mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God which be pour out full strength into the cup of his indignation an   sic   he shall be torment with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angel and in the presence of the Lamb -revelation

from the Antichrist 's government until the end of the Tribulation all of the time you gain in hiding be important for your spiritual growth and strengthening since only those who be extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for his sake tthe first thing to do be move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area for the Antichrist 's control will come last to the least populated area take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay attuned to event and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation   as you can see on the weather map heavy current of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak expect delay on I-95 outbound and perhaps school closing --m   Store water and food because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark water in lake and stream will be pollute by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood   get a good water filter --M   bring different type of clothing for all season as well as flashlight battery generator and first aid supply in short learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneer do VIII trust no one t tthere will be secret agent everywhere spy for the Antichrist 's government be on the lookout   perot supporter take note --M   IX watch for the antichrist tIt be important to realize who the Antichrist be and what he be up to for he will deceive many into think that he be a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it we can infer from Daniel 11 certain characteristic of this man Popular during the first three and a half year of the Tribulation he will dominate the airwave he will be physically appealing highly intelligent with Christ like charisma and personality an international politician military tactician and economic expert his word will be peace- he will make a treaty with the Jews which he will break after three and a half year he will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be heal even the very elect will be deceive if you do not pray and read the Bible you too will be deceive   dominate the airwave perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh -m   tthe antichrist will have a companion the False Prohphet   sic   who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak all who refuse to worhsip   sic   the image will be kill the final three and a half year will be absolutely insane with demonize spirit everywhere X. do not give up HOPE tthe seven year of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ the Antichrist will be defeat be steadfast and endure and you will be reward greatly in Heaven tstart read the Bible and pray fervently now the salvation of your sould depend upon it determine that come what may you will not take the

810;Brian Ceccarelli present we with the fallacy of false Dichotomy in state that we must accept every thing in the book attribute to Peter or we must discount every other book of antiquity Mr Ceccarelli you seem to be state that we must accept accept everything write in every historical document somehow I doubt do that yourself that thus since I doubt you accept everything write in every historical document I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the word of the book attribute to Peter I shall now give an example of a document from antiquity which I be sure you reject- it date from the time of Ramses II this be first present here by Matthew Wiener these inscription be carve soon after a battle and be carve with the Pharoah 's specific approval so we have true original rather than mere copy this account record the the battle of Kadesh circa 1285 BC which occur on the river Orontes about 100 mile south of Aleppo the Egyptians win this battle with the Hittites and Ramses have his victory inscribe all over the place a few of of these inscription have survive in near perfect form it be a record of how the Pharoah pretty much single handedly defeat the Hittites after be separate from his troop note that the egyptian waver back and forth between first and third person the following be from Miriam Lichtheims   Ancient egyptian Literature   volume II tmy majesty cause the force of the foe from Hitti to fall ton their face one upon the other as crocodile fall into tthe water of the Orontes I be after they like a griffin- tI attack all the country I alone for my infantry and tmy chariotry have desert me- not one of they stand look tback as I live as Ra love I as my father Atum favor tme everything that my majesty have tell I do it in truth tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry note this paragraph record not only Ramses divine word but also that there be thousand of witness to the event now from the heart of battle tthen his majesty drive at a gallop and charge the force tof the Foe from Hitti be alone by himself none other twith he his majesty proceed to look about he and tfound 2500 chariot ring he on his way out tno officer be with I no charioteer tno soldier of the army no shield bearer- tmy infantry my chariotry yield before they tNot one of they stand firm to fight with they tHis majesty speak what be this father Amun tis it right for a father to ignore his son tare my deed a matter for you to ignore tdo I not walk and stand at your word tI have not neglect an order you give ttoo great be he the great

hunt they like a griffin tI slaughter among they unceasingly so you see Brian we have a few original manuscript record the miraculous battle between the Ramses and the Hittites do you reject they as be   completely   true I suspect you do and if so then do you also in your own word question the existence of Alexander the great Tilgrath Pilisar III Nero Caligula Josephus Cyrus the great Artexerxes do you also thereby question all their document That s the problem with your all or nothing approach many ancient people use to mix a bit of fancy with their fact so for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter and the rest of the New Testament or accept no record of antiquity at all force you thereby to accept the verity of document you probably do not find completely credible as to your other argument that so many people have testify to Jesus that he must be true I have three point first this be argumentum ad populum ie appeal to popular opinion)- you can not vote on truth for instance do the million of Hindu 's past and present who testify to the reality of Brahma constitute actual evidence for the existence of Brahma how would you answer your own question in regard to the testimony of Hindus tWith a scoff of your keyboard with near complete ignorance of t the testimony be you go to say that that be all complete t hooey if you do so scoff then how do you objectively justify your own special pleading second it be not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testify to Jesus you can claim it to be clear but that do not make it true Third it be quite arguable

811;this definitely have nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science- some of it be relevant in technology there be little involvement of federal fund or except through support of state university of state fund for scientific research before WWII the US research position have be grow steadily and the funding be mainly from university and private foundation fund there be not that many research university but they all provide their researcher with low teaching load laboratory assistant and equipment and fund for travel to scientific meeting not that much but it be provide and a university wish to get a scholar have to consider research funding as well as salary during WWII the military and the defense department find that pure scientist could do quite well with their problem even though they be not exactly in the area of the scientists expertise this be probably because of the research mind approach which be not to try to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerge this work in stage and as research scientist be use to discussion about their problem the job get do the military realize the importance of maintain scientist for the future and start fund pure research after WWII but Congress be unwilling to have military fund divert into this investment into the future supply of scientist and set up other organization such as NSF to do the job it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politic out also the government do a job on private foundation make it more difficult for they to act to support research the bad part of the federal involvement be that in those area in which the government support research the university will not provide funding and in fact expect its scholar to bring in net government money suppose as have be the case I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few month what do you think happen if I ask for one the answer I will get be get the money from NSF now the money at the university level be a few thousand but at the NSF level it come to about 20 thousand and be likely to keep a faculty member from getting support so the government be in effect decide which project get support and how much also the government decide that the wealth should be spread so instead of have a moderate number of university which be primarily research institution the idea that more school should get into the act come into being and instead of evaluate scholar they have to go to evaluate reseach proposal as a researcher I can tell you that any research proposal have to be mainly wishful thinking or as now happen the investigator conceal already do work to release it as the result of the research what I be propose today I may solve before the funding be grant I may find impossible or I may find that it be too difficult in addition tomorrow I may get unexpected research result possibly I may bet a bright idea which solve yesterday 's too difficult problem or a whole new approach to something I have not consider can develop this be the nature of the beast and except for really vague statement if something can be predict it be not major research but development or routine activity not require more than minimal attention of a good researcher I believe that at this time less quality research be be do than would have happen if the government have never get into it and the government be try to divert researcher from thinker to plodder;2

817;no this be far from clear we only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that a survivor make this claim we have the contradictory word of the lawyer who speak with the survivor individually that all of they agree that they do not have a suicide pact and do not intentionally start the fire in the absense of any more evidence I do n't see how we can decide who to believe furthermore its quite possible that there be no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle take it upon themselves to kill everyone else with the state of the area now we may never know what happen again we have only the word of the FBI on this claim the lawyer who have also talk to the survor deny that any of they be make that claim I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probability its more likely that the bd 's start the fire than do the FBI but there be currently no way to decide what actually happen base on the publically available evidence which be nearly none D. the fire be an start accidentally by the bds I be truely amazed that I have hear or read of no one suggest this possibility with all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adult wear gas mask it have to have be chaotic inside I can easily image someone leave a lamp too close to something or accidentally drop a lamp or knock one over with the wind it would have quickly get out of control no I think that D be also quite reasonable I personally ca n't really asse any relative probablitie to either of these 3 probability although if force to bet on the issue I would probably take an accident either FBI or BD over intential setting of the fire I would also like to add a comment relate to the report that body recover have gunshot wound the coroner be on the Today Show this morning and categorically deny that they 've reach any such conclusion he point out that under intense heat sufficient pressure build up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which be quite consist with te report i 've read and hear in short there 's be almost no evidence corroborate any of the many scenario as to what happen on Monday we should remain skeptical until more information be available;3

819;well there be several burst in species diversity I can think of the cambrian and ordovician explosion result in a vast increase in animal diversity likewise after the one two punch of the permian and Triassic extinction the number of marine animal rise steadily    to an all time high   just prior to the spread of human    big exception be the K   T bye bye dinos extinction   about 800 family also plant arise from green algae and colonize the land in succesive sweep moss colonize very wet environment first fern who have evolve vascular tissue take over more territory when they evolve 1 these be eventually mostly replace by gymnosperm pine and the like 2 and then mostly displace by angiosperm flower plant now the dominant plant group on the planet(3 Fungi also radiate greatly with the invasion of the land 1 around the carboniferous up to about 200 family 2 around the triassic up to maybe 250 family 3 start in the cretaceous rise to about 600 family currently It 's unclear to I at least what the max equilibrium number of specie the earth can hold     and if it have ever hit this in the past it could be warn speculation alert that diversity have never reach a peak because mass extinction happen often enough to keep the total number down     this would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystem be see Cowen 's book history of Life for a not too technical run down on well like the title sez the history of life or see Wilson 's Diversity of Life for a view center more on current ecology this be IMHO the well popular biology book of what the hell I 'll say it all time follow up to t.o;2

853;think about what you be say here the 24 bit image be quantise down to 8 bit so many similar colour be map onto a single palette colour this colour get modify in fairly arbitrary way you then want to apply these modification back to the 24 bit file so you have to find which colour map to this one palette colour ok you could do this by copy the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and use the extra 8 bit to hold the index entry having do this you need to do something to they what exactly apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group this could generate colour with RGB outside the range 0 255 it would also lead to discontinuity when different part of a smooth colour gradient map to several different palette entry you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depend how far each colour be from the palette entry however I suspect this would look rather odd so in summary what I say in my previous posting still hold in other word to edit a 24 bit file you need software build for the job tack mod onto xv be go to create more problem than it solve as to the other bit you seem to be claim that there be bug in XV if that be not what you mean then yes I probably do I find that the collect digest format of your posting make it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point be sorry if I misunderstood yes again what   be   be wrong with xv Chris Lilley Technical Author ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit Manchester Computing Centre Oxford Road Manchester UK M13 9pl internet c.c.lilleymcc.ac.uk Voice 44 0)61 275 6045 fax 44 0)61 275 6040 Janet C.C.Lilleyuk.ac.mcc;1

898;I suppose you do n't know what about we have discuss we discuss about error(s in XV 2.21 which show image only as 8bit and my suggestion above work perfectly with it so far I have see a colormap edit window in XV that be there must be a colormap anyway the problem you present be exist anyway and I did n't try to solve they at all because I would not make such problem to my program in the first place Gamma and color correction be easily do to 24bit image as I present There 's no need make trick from 8bit   quantize image back to 24 bit image Ok you 're write about situation that user want edit image as 24bit and user want edit individual color your question by the way jump off the discussion a bit my solution does n't work because there 's no colormap withe real 24bit image you see user see 24bit image- go back to 8bit be silly about change individual color in 8bit   quantize   rasterize image change individual color in colormap be useless in most case if the image be quantize and rasterize small change may make serious error to anywhere in the image XV allow this feature but I do n't recommend to use it with the mention type image moreover XV be not a paint program- you can only make those global change in full 24bit XV change individual color sound like paint program job if person have 8bit screen there 's need for trick to get the original 24bit image modify because user do n't see full 24bit image there 's need to make approximation and it be not possible to modify individual color but individual pixel or pixel group if image be rasterize to select indiavidual color there could be 7x7 cursor window which show true color image in cursor window area select individual color be possible from that ok I do n't have think very much 24bit painting program never see such in good view and be not plan to make such not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen it save 8bit   quantize   rasterize image as 24bit jpegs- jpeg be not design for that also human expect that 24bit will be save as 24bit image- say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it be expect that the image still be the same so XV be design without think about human interface and how human expect the program work design error I have hear XV be design first for 8bit image   file but it be not good idea to take full 24bit image without make major change to the original design so even all screen image be 8bit the process image and save image could have be 24bit very easily instead of 8bit before anybody will make a note yes I may as well make a lift where up mean that the lift go down and down mean that the lift go up and put a note on this design solution to the manual however even the manual tell the correct situation it does n't solve the problem american the lift be just an example well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeede to read it;1
899;Supernovae put out 10   53 or 10   54 I forget which but it 's only an order of magnitude not in gamma ray though You 'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they be at 9 Mpc but if a decent fraction of the SN output be in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic but close than 9 Mpc I dunno sn theory so well but I ca n't think of how to get many gamma out maybe I should look it up big radio galaxy can put out 10   46 erg   s   continually   That be just in the radio there be a lot of gamma around they too but burst Nah neither of these should be take as explanation just try to show that those energy   be   produce by thing we know about;2

915;probably because it be rape so nothing it may work for some but not for other it does n't give any insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be dependent solely on the individual as well as individually create and since Christians have fail to show we how there way of life be in any wy well than our I do not see why the attempt to try it be necessary or even particularly attractive well we will nerver know for sure if we be tell the truth or not but at the very least there be a bit more evidence point to the fact that say there be a military conflict in Vietnam 25 year ago then there be a supernatural diety who want we to live a certain way the fact that Jesus warn against it mean nothing   I   warn against it too big deal this be not true the first two choice here life and death be scantily document and the last one be total malarky unless one use the Bible and that be totally circular perhaps it be well to use the imagination or one 's ignorance someone else will address this I 'm sure and refer you to plenty of documentation how be this there be nothing more disgusting than christian attempt to manipulate   interpret the Old Testament as be fill with sign for the coming of Christ every little reference to a stick or bit of wood be autmoatically interpret as the Cross what a miscarriage of philology well since we have skeptical heart thank goodness there be no way to get into we here we have the irreconcilable difference christian glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub trust   belief   faith without knowledge if I be lucky one day and I happen to be think of God at the same time my enkephalin go up then I may associate this as a sign of God it will feel right and I will trust without know maybe religosity do not seem to be anything that be conclusively arrive at but rather it seem to be more of a sudden affliction I believe many of we be willing to die for what we believe many of we be not the question be be suchg an attitude reflective of a   correct   or healthy morality it would seem not to be the same thing could reflect fanaticism for example and be any case an expression of simple selfishness --Adam;0

918;I think C.S.

935;wow you get I think now this be an interesting question in that recently there have be a move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal activity as ok in the past it seem to I there be always two coexist method of social control First and most explicit be legal control that be the set of action we define as currently illegal and have a specifically define set of punishment secondly and somewhat more hide be social control these be the action which be consider socially unacceptable and while not cover by legal control be scrictly control by social censure ideally if socialization be work as it should legal control be hardly ever need since most people voluntarilly control their action due to the pressure of social censure the control manifest itself in day to day life as guilt and morality I 've hear it say and fully believe that if it were n't for the VAST majority of people police themselves legal control would be absolutely impossible lately last 50 100 year however there have be a move to attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control ie if it ai n't illegal then do n't pick on I I 'm not say this be wrong merely that it be a byproduct of a society which have t1 a high education level t2 a high exposure to alternative idea via the popular medium t3 a high level of institutionalized individual right and t4 a me orient culture I guess what I 'm say be that we appear to be in a state of transition here in the western world in that we still have many idea about what we can ca n't allow people to do base entirely on personal squeamishness yet we be fully bent on maximize individual freedom to the max as long as those freedom do n't impinge on another 's IMHO society be try to persue two mutually exclusive end here while we appreciate and persue individual right these satisfy the old territoriality and dominance instinct the removal of socialize inherent fear base on ignorance will result in the continue destabilization of society I get no quick fix I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess I know I would never consent to the roll back of personal freedom in order to stabilize society yet I believe development of society follow a darwinian process which select for stability can we find a social model which maximize indiv freed 's yet be stable perhaps it be possible to live with a non stable society anybody see a way out comment PS therefore answer to question   3 we do n't do we want to Phil Trodwell;0
936;yes Here be what you should do keep the vertex in an array and have the polygon triangle be okay but n sided polygon be slightly more efficient store the index into the array of the vertex that comprise they you set a flag for each vertex when you transform it so you do n't have to transform any vertex more than once- you also do backface elimination before process the polygon so that vertice that belong only to bacface poly do n't have to be transform at all whenever you transform a vertex check if it be on the far side of the hither plane- if it be you can project it right away and store the result then do your z clip- any vertex that get produce will have to have their projection do at that stage;1

941;Brian Ceccarelli write that 's I Kent Sandvik respond I think I see where you be come from Kent Jesus does n't view guilt like our modern venacular color it feeling have nothing to do with guilt feeling arise from the state of be guilty feeling and guilt be mutally exclusive feeling be a reaction from guilt Jesus be talk about the guilt state not the reaction let I give you an example have you ever make a mistake have you ever lie to someone even a little white lie have you ever claim to know something that you really did n't know have you ever hate someone have you ever be selfish be you guilty of any one of these the answer be of course yes you be guilty Period that be it what Jesus be get at no big surprise feeling do not even enter the picture consider Jesus 's use of the word guilt as how a court use it Jesus be concern that everyone should admit that they be guilty of be imperfect the Bible call it the state that we be all sinner we all do bad thing even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong be proof of our guilt that we be all sinner it be it in our nature to do bad thing we be sinner therefore we do bad thing be a sinner be fact it be not a pleasant fact but it be just a fact we be not perfect call we sinner should have no more emotional charge to you than call you a human being Guilty as charge you can handle your guilt in one of two way acknowledge you make a mistake learn from it and try to not do it again in the meantime not punish yourself for it which be the way Jesus want you to handle or it this be the healthy way or two the destructive way put yourself down slap yourself and feel like crap never forgive yourself force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys even to suicide this the way Jesus do not want we to deal with it all people fall into this category to some extent in their life Jesus be not in the business of save we from this guilt feeling Jesus be in the business of show we how much he love we despite our guilt Jesus know we be guilty that is n't new to he it be no big deal to he he just want you to realize that this sinful nature destroy the relationship between you and he that be what he want you to know why because he want to have your company you be immensely valuable to he Jesus want a relationship with you however in our present sinful nature we be incapable of have this relationship God be perfect we be not you can not fit a square peg into a round hole however God have provide a way for we to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with he God have provide Jesus so that whosoever just believe in Jesus will have their nature change the Holy Spirit will move it and now divine nature be now within life our very being and we and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy Spirit the benefit of this be endless for with the divine nature live within we we can now see our imperfection well we can now head they off at the pass with the power of the Holy Spirit live in we we now have his power to help we overcome our shortcoming because the divine nature live within we we can now understand profound Bible passage that never before we could understand because the divine nature now live within we we now have authority over demonic force and lastly because the divine nature now live within we we have eternal life for the Holy Spirit be eternal the relationship with Jesus be of the utmost importance because it be not what you do in life that qualify you to belong to heavenly kingdom it be your relationship to the live God remember what Jesus say at the tail end of Matthew when he separate the goat from the sheep many people in the last day will ask he Did n't I prophesy in your name and do miracle and do good thing in your name and what do Jesus say depart from I for I never   know   you that be the cornerstone of Christianity Kent Jesus must know you as his friend it be your relationship to Jesus if he be your friend and you be his you will be count among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven good it show that you have a strong self image that you love yourself that be the second great commandment Jesus teach if only more people could do as you do as I say before in the common english venacular feel guilty have a different meaning than the state of guilt I believe what we all need in our personality be a lot less ego a lot less self centeredness and a lot more unconditional love;3

943;Rick I think we can safely say 1 Robert be not the only person who understand the Bible and 2 the leadership of the LDS church historicly never have Let 's consider some personal interpretation and see how much trust we should put in Orthodox Mormonism which could never be confuse with Orthodox Christianity in one of his attack on Christians the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie say they thrash around in darkness in try to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise Messiah he also say Christians be wrong to believe that Jehovah be the Supreme Deity   God the Father   and that Christ come into mortality as his only Begotten Son McConkie then state what mormon believe today to be the truth about the matter he say that Elohim be the Father and Jehovah be the Son be thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualist have go in define their three in one God it come as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in try to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promise Messiah some sectarian even believe that Jehovah be the Supreme Deity whose Son come into mortality as the only Begotten as with their concept that God be a Spirit this misinformation about the Gods of Heaven be untrue the fact be and it too be attest by Holy Writ that Elohim be the Father and that Jehovah be the Son who be bear into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ the promise Messiah Promised Messiah p. 100 Notice that McConkie say the Christians be as wrong about their three in one God and their belief that God be a Spirit as they be in their understanding of who Elohim and Jehovah be before examine McConkie 's attack and its validity we shall read a few more statement by McConkie and other Mormon source concern the word Elohim and Jehovah McConkie state the chief designation of Christ that have be preserve for we in the Old Testament as that ancient work be now publish be the exalt name title Jehovah Promised Messiah p. 367   Elohim   plural word though it be be also use as the exalt name title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connote his supremacy and omnipotence he be God above all god Mormon Doctrine p. 224 agree with McConkie on the question of who Elohim and Jehovah be the Apostle James E. Talmage state   Elohim   as understand and use in the restore Church of Jesus Christ be the name title of God the Eternal Father whose firstborn Son in the spirit be   Jehovah   the only Begotten in the flesh Jesus Christ Jesus the Christ p. 38 a Doctrinal Exposition by the First Presidency and the twelve apostle of the Mormon Church state that God the Eternal Father is   designated   by the exalt name title elohim Articles of Faith p. 466 Christ in his preexistent antemortal or unembodied state be know as Jehovah Articles of Faith p. 471 today Mormon leader teach that Elohim in the OT refer to God the Father and Jehovah refer to Christ McConkie attack Christians for say Jehovah can refer to the Father he stress that these two name title should not be change around so that Christ be call Elohim and the Father be call Jehovah the Father be Elohim not Jehovah Jehovah be Christ and Christ be Jehovah- they be one and the same person Promised Messiah p. 111 in the OT of the kjv of the Bible the hebrew word Elohim be use to refer to the true God false god and goddess and the judge of Israel when refer to the true God Elohim be translate with a capital G. when refer to false god and goddess and the judge of Israel it be translate with a small g. it be translate four time as judge Exod 21:6- 22:8 9 once as judge 1 Sam 2:25 twice as mighty Gen. 23:6- Exod 9:28 once as angel Ps 8:5 once as godly Mal 2:15 once as great Gen. 30:8 and once as very great 1 Sam 14:15 the word Jehovah be the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or yhvh with the vowel point take from the word Adonai many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation be Yahweh or Yahveh however since Jehovah rather than Yahweh be the word use by Mormonism this section will also use Jehovah instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claim of Mormon leader regard that name Jehovah unlike Elohim be never use of false god it be the personal name of the triune God of the Bible in the kjv Jehovah be render primarily LORD sometimes GOD and rarely Lord now that we understand something about the word Elohim and Jehovah and their use by Mormon leader we shall consider the Apostle mcconkie 's attack on Christians for believe the Father be Jehovah in try to prove that Jehovah refer exclusively to Christ McConkie cite several verse from the Bible some of these verse and McConkie 's interpretation of they will be examine to see whether he be right remember McConkie say the Father be not Jehovah- he be only Elohim the first example we shall consider involve McConkie 's interpretation of Ps 110:1 of this verse he state of whom spake David when his tongue be touch by the Holy Spirit and he testify the Lord say unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemy thy footstool Ps 110:1 two Lords be here involve one be speak to the other- one be great than the other- one be make provision for the triumph and glory of the other who be they and what message be contain in this messianic prophecy what think ye of Christ our Lord ask certain of his detractor toward the end of his mortal ministry whose son be he be Christ the Son of God or of someone else be he to be bear of a divine Parent or will he be as other man a mortal son of a mortal father that he be to be a descendant of David be a matter of great pride to all the Jews and so they answer the Son of David David 's son truly he be but he be more much more and so our Lord with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture ask how then doth David in spirit call he Lord say the Lord say unto my Lord sit thou on my right hand till I make thine enemy thy footstool if David then call he Lord how be he his son that be if he be only the Son of David how be it that the great king act under inspiration call he Lord and worship he as such and we might add   who be the other Lord the one who spake unto David 's Lord   can there be any question as to how Jesus be interpret the word of the Psalm he be say that it mean the Father say unto the Son Elohim say unto Jehovah   sit thou on my right hand until after your mortal ministry- then I will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with I where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever Promised Messiah pp 101 102 emphasis add agree with the above statement by McConkie the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet   what the mormon think of Christ p. 6 read the Lord   Elohim the Father   say unto my Lord   Jehovah the Son   bracket in original McConkie clearly state that it be Elohim the Father who be speak to Jehovah the Son in this Psalm however when one look at the hebrew word translate LORD it become apparent that either the first LORD be not the Father or else the Father be Jehovah either way McConkie be wrong the Psalm read the LORD   Jehovah   say unto my Lord   Adon   sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemy thy footstool Ps 110:1 the first LORD in this verse be Jehovah who Mormonism say be Christ not the Father the second Lord be the hebrew word Adon singular for Adonai mean master or lord if the first LORD be the Father and the second Lord be the Son then the Father be Jehovah and the Son be Adon however if the Father be not Jehovah as McConkie claim then the first LORD be Jehovah the Son but who then be Adon obviously the Father be Jehovah in this Psalm and his Son be Adon another example involve Isa 42:6 about which McConkie state the following I the Lord have call thee in righteousness   Isaiah quote the Father as say of Christ   and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles Isa 42:6 Promised Messiah p. 81 emphasis add McConkie say the Father be speak of Christ in this passage which read I the LORD   Jehovah   have call thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles Isa 42:6 accord to McConkie I the LORD refer to the Father and thine and thee refer to Christ however the LORD who be speak be Jehovah which mean either McConkie be wrong about who be speak or else the Father be Jehovah another example involve Ps 22:7 8 of these verse McConkie state shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the Lord that he would deliver he let he deliver he see he delight in he Ps 22:7 8   the fulfillment as Jesus hang on the cross   be find in these word the chief priest mock he with the scribe and elder say he saved others- himself he can not save if he be the King of Israel let he now come down from the cross and we will believe he he trust in God- let he deliver he now if he will have he for he say I be the Son of God the thief also which be crucify with he cast the same in his tooth Matt 27:41 44 Promised Messiah pp 530 531 emphasis add Ps 22:7 8 read as follow all they that see I laugh I to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head say he trust on the LORD   Jehovah   that he would deliver he let he deliver he see he delight in he McConkie say these verse have their fulfillment as Jesus hang on the cross that mean the person who be scorn in these verse be Christ who then be the LORD in whom he trust it be Jehovah the Father another example involve Ps 31:13 and Ps 41:9 regard they McConkie state the following with reference to the conniving and conspire plot incident to our lord 's arrest and judicial trial the prophecy be they take counsel together against I they devise to take away my life Ps 31:13 mine own familiar friend in whom I trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up his heel against I Ps 41:9 promise Messiah p. 532 Apostle McConkie say these Psalms refer to Christ 's arrest and judicial trial we shall first consider Ps 31 and then Ps 41 while McConkie only quote verse 13 of Ps 31 verse 14 will also be include to give a complete understanding of the matter for I have hear the slander of many fear be on every side while they take counsel together against I they devise to take away my life but I trust in thee o LORD   Jehovah   I say Thou art my God   elohim   Ps 31:13 14 McConkie say verse 13 refer to Jesus Christ verse 14 go on to tell that he Christ trust in the LORD who be call his God or Elohim mormonism teach that the God above Jesus be Elohim the Father verse 14 however reveal that the Elohim of the man Jesus be Jehovah the Father in Ps 41 McConkie only quote one verse- however two verse will be consider in this examination Yea mine own familiar friend in whom I trust which do eat of my bread hath lift up his heel against I but thou o LORD   Jehovah   be merciful unto I and raise I up that I may requite they Ps 41:9 10 McConkie state above that verse 9 refer to Judas role in Christ 's death since it be Judas who be the familiar friend who lift up his heel the pronoun mine I my and I in verse 9 must refer to Christ notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there be a change of pronoun to thou which refer to the LORD Jehovah then the pronoun I and I which refer to Christ be use again that mean Christ be speak to Jehovah the Father in these verse another example involve McConkie 's follow remark about Ps 110:4 one of the great messianic prophecy speak by the mouth of David ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps 110:4 Promised Messiah p. 450 McConkie admit this be a messianic prophecy involve Christ the question be what in this verse refer to Christ the LORD   Jehovah   hath swear and will not repent Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek Ps 110:4 do the LORD which be Jehovah refer to Christ if McConkie be right and Jesus be Jehovah but the Father be not then the LORD would have to refer to Christ but who then be the one address as the priest forever after the order of Melchizedek the Bible reveal that the one refer to be Jesus Christ Heb 5:8 10- 6:20- 7)- therefore the LORD Jehovah in Ps 110:4 be the Father another example involve Isa 53:4 12 of these verse McConkie state of the atone sacrifice of the future Messiah Isaiah say the   Lord   have lay on he the iniquity of we all it please the   Lord   to bruise he Promised Messiah p. 234 emphasis add McConkie rightly say these verse refer to the atone sacrifice of the future Messiah however what he fail to mention be that they also prove that the Father be Jehovah verse 6 read all we like sheep have go astray- we have turn every one to his own way- and the LORD   Jehovah   hath lay on he   Christ   the iniquity of we all and verse 10 read yet it please the LORD   Jehovah   to bruise he   Christ   obviously the LORD who lay on Christ the iniquity of we all and who bruise he be God the Father who be call Jehovah in these verse remember McConkie state that some sectarian even believe that Jehovah be the Supreme Deity and that Christ come into mortality as his only Begotten Son he call this concept misinformation that be untrue to prove that it be McConkie who be misinformed and believe untruth two scriptural reference 2 Sam 7:14- Ps 2:7 will be examine McConkie state the following regard these scripture in the midst of a passage that be clearly messianic the Lord say of the Seed of David I will be his father and he shall be my son 2 Sam 7:14 in the second Psalm the whole of which be also clearly messianic occur this statement thou art my Son- this day have I beget thee Ps 2:7 Paul quote both of these statement in Hebrews 1:5 and say they be prophecy that Christ would come as the Son of God Promised Messiah p. 143 McConkie cite Heb 1:5 to show that 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 2:7 refer to Christ who would come as the Son of God since McConkie first reference 2 Sam 7:14 this examination will too however along with verse 14 verses 11 13 will also be include and as since the time that I command judge to be over my people Israel and have cause thee to rest from all thine enemy also the LORD   Jehovah   telleth thee that he will make thee an house and when thy day be fulfil and thou shalt sleep with thy father I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowel and I will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever I will be his father and he shall be my son 2 Sam 7:11 14 these verse teach that the LORD Jehovah would have a Son the Messiah in the second example McConkie cite Ps 2:7 this examination will include verse 8 notice that it be the LORD Jehovah who say Thou art my Son- this day have I beget thee I will declare the decree the LORD   Jehovah   hath say unto I Thou art my Son- this day have I beget thee ask of I and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost part of the earth for thy possession McConkie say these verse of scripture be clearly messianic and he acknowledge they teach that Christ would come as the Son of God what he be not willing to acknowledge however be that these scripture also teach that the Father be Jehovah and that the sectarian who believe Jehovah be the Supreme Deity whose Son be Jesus Christ the only Begotten be right in their belief another example involve Mic 5:4 of this verse McConkie state the following and so truly do our Lord act   during his mortal ministry truly this be he of whom it be write   he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth Mic 5:4 Promised Messiah p. 182 emphasis add accord to McConkie the pronoun he at the beginning of Mic 5:4 refer to Christ during his mortal ministry who then be the LORD his God Mic 5:4 read and he   Christ   shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD   Jehovah   in the majesty of the name of the LORD   Jehovah   his God   elohim   for now shall he be great unto the end of the earth obviously the LORD of Jesus Christ be Jehovah the Father who be refer to as Jehovah his Elohim another example involve Ps 2:2 and Isa 61:1 of these verse McConkie state the follow a number of messianic passage speak of the Lord and his anoint Ps 2:2 signify that the Chosen One be consecrate and set apart for the ministry and mission that be his   Jesus apply these passage to himself   by quote Isaiah 's prophecy the Lord hath anoint I to preach good tiding unto the meek Isa 61:1 and then say this day be this scripture fulfil in your ear Luke 4:21 Promised Messiah pp 182 183 emphasis add the first source McConkie quote Ps 2:2 read as follow the king of the earth set themselves and the ruler take counsel together against the LORD   Jehovah   and against his anointed McConkie say the anointed one be Christ if that be true who be Jehovah if Jehovah be always Christ who be the anointed one obviously Jehovah be refer to God the Father and the anointed be indeed refer to Christ the second source McConkie cite be Isa 61:1 which state the Spirit of the Lord   Adonai   GOD   Jehovah   be upon me- because the LORD   Jehovah   hath anoint I to preach good tiding unto the meek- he hath send I to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to they that be bound- the one who be anoint to preach bind up proclaim and open be Jesus Christ who then be the one who anoint he this verse say the LORD Jehovah do the anointing again we face the same problem if Jehovah do not refer to the Father but only to Christ then Jesus anoint someone but who as McConkie point out Jesus apply these passage to himself therefore the Jehovah who anoint Christ be God the Father other example could be cite to show that McConkie and other Mormon leader be wrong when they say God the Father be not Jehovah however these should be enough to expose their error now what about Mormonism 's claim that Jesus be Jehovah but he be not Elohim it be true that Jesus be Jehovah the following scripture prove this fact thus saith the LORD   Jehovah   the King of Israel and his redeemer the LORD   Jehovah   of hosts- I be the first and I be the last- and beside I there be no God Isa 44:6   Jesus say   I be the first and the last I be he that liveth and be dead Rev. 1:17 18 saith the LORD   Jehovah they shall look upon I whom they have pierce and they shall mourn for he as one mourneth for his only son Zech 12:1,10 Behold he   Christ   cometh with clouds- and every eye shall see he and they also which pierce he Rev. 1:7 I be the LORD   Jehovah   thy God the Holy One of Israel Isa 43:3 Ye deny the Holy One   Christ   and the just act 3:14 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD   Jehovah   shall be deliver Joel 2:32 the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth there be none other name under heaven give among man whereby we must be save act 4:10,12 Behold the Lord GOD   Jehovah   will come with strong hand his reward be with he Isa 40:10 Behold I   Christ   come quickly- and my reward be with I Rev. 22:12 the LORD   Jehovah   my God shall come and all the saint with thee Zech 14:5 at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saint 1 Thess 3:13 the LORD   Jehovah   be my shepherd Ps 23:1   Jesus say   I be the good shepherd John 10:14 saith the Lord GOD   Jehovah   I will seek that which be lose Ezek 34:15 16 the Son of man be come to seek and to save that which be lose Luke 19:10 for I be the LORD   Jehovah   thy God the Holy One of Israel thy Saviour Isa 43:3 look for that bless hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ Tit 2:13 see also Jer 42:5 and Rev. 1:5- Mal 3:6 and Heb 13:8- 1 Kin 8:28,39 and John 2:24 25- Isa 25:8 and 2 Tim 1:10- Ps 107:24,29 and Matt 8:26- prov.3:12 and Rev. 3:19 while mormon be right when they say Jesus be Jehovah they be wrong when they say he be not Elohim the Bible reveal that Jehovah be the only true Elohim there is- all other be false remember Jehovah be the personal name of the triune God who have reveal himself in the Bible before we consider biblical quote which show that Jehovah and Elohim be not two separate god as Mormons claim let we first note that not only be both God the Father and Christ address as Jehovah and Elohim but so be the Holy Spirit Whereof the   Holy Ghost said this   be   the covenant that I will make with they after those day saith the Lord I will put my law into their heart and in their mind will I write them- and their sin and iniquity will I remember no more Heb 10:15 17 emphasis on Holy Ghost and say add Behold the day come   saith the LORD    Jehovah   that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah I will put my law in their inward part and write it in their hearts- and will be their God   Elohim   and they shall be my people I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more

McConkie involve Jehovah and his creation be the belief that Jehovah have many pre mortal spirit help he create include in this allege group be Joseph Smith Jr. that he   Christ   be aid in the creation of this earth by many of the noble and great spirit child of the Father be evident from go down for there be space there and we will take of these material and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell Abra 3:22 24 Michael or Adam be one of these Enoch Noah Abraham Moses Peter James and John Joseph Smith and many other noble and great one play a part in the great creative enterprise Doctrines of Salvation vol 1 pp 74 75 Mormon Doctrine p. 169 the Bible reveal the truth about this matter thus saith the LORD   Jehovah   thy redeemer and he that form thee from the womb I be the LORD   Jehovah   that maketh all things- that stretcheth forth the heavens alone- that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself Isa 44:24 which alone spreadeth out the heaven and treadeth upon the wave of the sea Job 9:8 Jehovah by himself create all thing he have no alleged preexistent spirit helper assist he regard the Mormon Elohim the Apostle McConkie state Elohim plural word though it be be also use as the exalt name title of God the Eternal Father a usage that connote his supremacy and omnipotence he be God above all god Mormon Doctrine p. 224 he also state that Jesus be above all save the Father only Promised Messiah p. 363 the Bible state that the one who be God above all so call god be the triune God Jehovah for the LORD   Jehovah   be a great God   El   and a great king above all god   elohim   Ps 95:3 for thou LORD   Jehovah   art high above all the earth thou art exalt far above all god   elohim   Ps 97:9 now I know that the LORD   Jehovah   be great than all god   elohim   Exod 18:11 see also Ps 135:5- Deut 10:17 if Mormon leader be right when they say Jehovah be god the son and Elohim be god the father these verse from the Bible would be teach that the Mormon son be above his father however as McConkie clearly state mormon believe Elohim the father not Jehovah the son be the God above all Gods that Jesus be above all except the father- yet the Bible teach that Jehovah be above all Elohim at a BYU Dev on March 2 1982 Bruce R. McConkie make the following remark about pray to Jesus another peril be that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel have be develop this be plain sectarian nonsense our prayer be address to the Father and to he only perfect prayer be address to the Father in the name of the Son- it be utter by the power of the Holy Ghost our relationship with the Lord pp 19 20 McConkie state on p. 335 of his book promise Messiah that the mormon pray to the Father not the Son on p. 306 of the same book McConkie state that Christ   the Son   be Jehovah this be important to remember because although McConkie say prayer be not to be offer to the Mormon Christ who be Jehovah the Bible state repeatedly in the OT that people pray to Jehovah and he not only hear those prayer but he accept they as valid request the follow be but a small sample of the vast number of time people pray to Jehovah in my distress I call upon the LORD   Jehovah   and cry unto my God   elohim   he hear my voice out of his temple and my cry come before he even into his ear Ps 18:6 and the LORD   Jehovah   say unto he I have hear thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast make before I I have hallow this house which thou hast build to put my name there for ever- and mine eye and mine heart shall be there perpetually 1 Kin 9:3 and say unto Jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accept before thee and pray for we unto the LORD   Jehovah   thy God   Elohim   even for all this remnant Jer 42:2 o LORD   Jehovah   I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servant who desire to fear thy name Neh 1:11 and it be so that when Solomon have make an end of pray all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD   Jehovah   he arise from before the altar of the LORD   Jehovah   from kneel on his knee with his hand spread up to heaven 1 Kin 8:54 he go in therefore and shut the door upon they twain and pray unto the LORD   Jehovah   2 Kin 4:33 go and say to Hezekiah thus saith the LORD   Jehovah   the God   elohim   of David thy father I have hear thy prayer I have see thy tear behold I will add unto thy day fifteen year Isa 38:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hide I say I will confess my transgression unto the LORD   jehovah- and thou forgav the iniquity of my sin for this shall every one that be godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be find Ps 32:5 6 notice above in Ps 32:6 that the godly pray to Jehovah accord to McConkie and other Mormon leader that be Christ the very one to whom McConkie say people should not pray the Bible reveal there be only one true Elohim and his name be Jehovah all other Elohim be false they be idol that cause their follower to commit adultery against the true Elohim and idolatry for the LORD   Jehovah   be great and greatly to be praise he be to be fear above all god   elohim   for all the god   elohim   of the nation be idol but the LORD   Jehovah   make the heaven Ps 96:4 5 Thou shalt have no other god   elohim   before I Exod 20:3 now I know that the LORD   Jehovah   be great than all god   elohim   Exod 18:11 and it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD   Jehovah   thy God   elohim   and walk after other god   elohim   and serve they and worship they I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish Deut 8:19 Thou shalt make no covenant with they nor with their god   elohim   they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make thee sin against I for if thou serve their god   Elohim   it will surely be a snare unto thee Exod 23:32- 33 take heed to yourself that your heart be not deceive and ye turn aside and serve other god   Elohim   and worship they Deut 11:16 that ye come not among these nation these that remain among you- neither make mention of the name of their god   elohim   nor cause to swear by they neither serve they nor bow yourself unto they Josh 23:7 neither walk after other god   elohim   to your hurt Jer 7:6 but the LORD   Jehovah   be the true God   Elohim   he be the live God   elohim   Jer 10:10 and they forsook the LORD   Jehovah   God   elohim   of their father which bring they out of the land of Egypt and follow other god   elohim   of the god   elohim   of the people that be round about they and bow themselves unto they and provoke the LORD   Jehovah   to anger Jud 2:12 shall a man make god   elohim   unto himself and they be no god   elohim   therefore behold I will this once cause they to know I will cause they to know mine hand and my might- and they shall know that my name be the LORD   Jehovah   Jer 16:20 21 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD   Jehovah   choose you this day whom ye will serve- whether the god   elohim   which your father serve that be on the other side of the flood or the god   elohim   of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for I and my house we will serve the LORD   Jehovah   and the people answer and say God   elohim   forbid that we should forsake the LORD   Jehovah   to serve other god   elohim   Josh 24:15 16 these verse teach that the only true live Elohim in heaven and on earth be Jehovah the triune God who make heaven and earth and all therein Jehovah be great than any Elohim because all other Elohim be idol the reality behind they be demonic Deut 32:17 Jehovah Elohim have give explicit warning and guideline regard these false Elohim he tell his people not to have any Elohim but he he tell the people that if they leave he for the false Elohim those Elohim would be a snare to they and they would be hurt and would perish he warn the people to take heed that their heart be not deceive into worshiping serve swear by and make covenant with false Elohim Jehovah Elohim tell his people he would eventually judge all false Elohim and their follower despite these warning and guideline Elohim 's covenant people forsook he and believe in and worship the false Elohim 's of the people they come in contact with Ju 10:6 state that the child of Israel do evil again in the sight of the LORD   Jehovah   and serve Baalim and Ashtaroth and the god   elohim   of Syria and the god   elohim   of Zidon and the god   elohim   of Moab and the god   elohim   of the child of Ammon and the god   elohim   of the Philistines and forsook the LORD   Jehovah   and serve not he this examination have show that the Elohim of Mormonism like the Elohim in Ju 10:6 be not the true Jehovah Elohim therefore the people who leave the true Elohim for the Mormon Elohim will do evil in the sight of the LORD   Jehovah   although McConkie attack Christians for their belief in a triune God who be Spirit and for their belief that God the Father   Jehovah   send his Son into the world these belief be true God be triune- he be Spirit- he be Jehovah- and he do send his Son into the world to redeem mankind it be obvious from this examination that it be not the Christians who thrash around in darkness about who Elohim and Jehovah be one wonder what Holy Writ McConkie have in mind when he state that it attest to the fact that Elohim be the Father and that Jehovah be the Son he certainly do not mean the Bible which teach that the Father Son and Holy Spirit be all the one Jehovah Elohim he apparently do not mean the DC either because chapter 109 verses 1,4,9 10 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as Jehovah Summary obviously Joseph Fielding Smith 's statement that the Mormons have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God Doctrines of Salvation 1:279 be not accurate the Mormon god be not the true God as Mormonism claim but be idol which cause their follower to commit adultery against God and idolatry in answer to Jesus question but whom say ye that I be mormon say Jesus be someone different from the Jesus who be reveal in the Bible and whom the apostle preach therefore anyone trust in the Mormon Jesus be believe in another Jesus whom Paul warn about Bernard P. Brockbank of the First Quorum of the Seventy admit in the May 1977 issue of the Ensign a Mormon publication that the Mormon Jesus be different from the Christian Jesus he state that it be true that many of the christian church worship a different Jesus Christ than be worship by the Mormons or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saint p. 26 the people who believe in the Mormon Jesus be commit adultery against God and idolatry they do not have the Son- therefore they do not have the Father and they do not have eternal life as the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly state salvation come only by worship the true God Promised Messiah p. 163 McConkie also rightly state that the mere worship of a god who have the proper scriptural name do not assure one that he be worship the true and live God because the true name of deity can be apply to false concept of God Mormon Doctrine p. 270 remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admit that Joseph Smith Jr. give a new conception of God and the Godhead contribution of Joseph Smith p. 1 it be important for the people who have leave the true triune God reveal in the Bible to repent and return to he they must forsake the sin of idolatry and adultery which they be commit in Mormonism all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from I shall be write in the earth because they have forsake the LORD   Jehovah   the fountain of living water Jer 17:13 and it shall be if thou do at all forget the LORD   Jehovah   thy God   elohim   and walk after other god   elohim   and serve they and worship they I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish Deut 8:19 Thou shalt make no covenant with their god   elohim   Exod 23:32 put away the strange god   elohim   that be among you and be clean and change your garment Gen. 35:2 flee from idolatry 1 Cor 10:14 it be necessary that Christians hee the warning of the Bible if they do they will not fall into the sin of adultery against God and idolatry remember to know the only true God be eternal life John 17:3;3

951;apparently you   did n't   read the whole thing you continue to miss the point   deletion   Counselling that only provide alternative to abortion would be just as biased as counselling that only provide   abortion   information how about provide counselling that will give a woman help in find what   she   be comfortable with your adoption funding idea may be a good one any idea if it be feasable make adoption easy on the birth mother may help reduce abortion but it will   not   eliminate the need for it abortion be not do just because the mother ca n't care for the child and does n't feel good about give it to stranger abortion be do because the mother can not afford the   pregnancy   then please justify why be human automatically make something valuable and why that include the unborn no they be not guarantee to become productive member of society even if they do that be   many year   in the future until which they be a burden on someone or society there be also the matter of the mother force she to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent she from be a productive member of society ok look It 's like this we   be   foot the bill maybe they will take choice a. maybe they will take choice B. maybe they will take choice C. they ca n't afford any   one   of they if they take choice a we 'd have to pay they say   5 if they take choice b it would cost we   20 if they take choice c it will cost we   20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 year which one sound the most realistic for we to be willing to pay for now some people happen not to like choice a. other people happen not to like choice c pay for it that be C have be around and pay for for year even though it mean we spend a lot of money we ca n't in conscience refuse to pay for it now a have be around and be perfectly legal but it has n't be fund in the past now A be go to be fund but some people object they do n't like the idea of their tax money go to pay for choice a. so we could refuse to fund A at all then those woman who ca n't afford any of those choice will be force to take choice b or C which will cost   all of we   more money Most of we do n't see any reason at all why   more money   should be spend to the effect of   remove personal choice   from some woman the alternative be to fund A if that be what the mother choose we will also still fund b and even c if   that   be what the mother choose however some woman will certainly choose A and that will then save we   15 we otherwise would have have to spend your taxis be not be raise to fund a choice you object they be be   lower   because we will fund a choice that be   legal   despite your objection to it actually your taxis be not really go to go down as I 'm sure you would point out but the amount that be save in that area can help out in another like our massive debt those other procedure you mention only cost money there be no saving in other procedure that would be require down the road without they in fact there could be additional cost down the road   because   of they this be quite different from the case of abortion this be bullshit we be   not   refuse to make the alternative affordable too if we refuse to pay for the more expensive choice of birth   then   your statement would make sense but that be not the case so it does n't if Clinton try to block funding for pre natal care and delivery or leave it out of his health care plan I would certainly object I would also be quite surprised yes but probably not your definition of it or for the reason you think you STUPID FUCK   we do   want to fund   all   the choice   you   be the one who want to   not   fund all the choice your humble opinion be still wrong even with easy adoption there be still the fact that pregnancy take several month month in which a young woman could need to be get an education like finish High School enter college finish college get a job thing that be much hard to do if you have to take a break for a few month thing that have a massive impact on her future productivity you   can   have a conversation with the mentally incompetant and even though   you   personally may refuse to have a conversation with people you just do n't like it be still   possible   for other to have a conversation with they it be   not   possible for   anyone   to have a conversation with a fetus he be still biologically independent at least to the same extent you be now he consume nutrient and digest they in the normal manner he breathe his own air a fetus on the other hand get it 's nutrient already digest by the mother it get its oxygen from the mother as well that be not biologically independent Awareness be only   part   of what make a member of society it be the minimal conceivable requirement yet many people seem to think that something without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing of a true member of society I keep ask but I still have n't see a real justification for why the life of a non sentient creature should be worth the suffering of a sentient being I have n't read every response on the thread i 've be ask on yet so we 'll see if I see one later anyone who can program in UNIX have a lot of experience in the real world;3
952;about my reply it a society that be constantly on the verge of flame Usenet diplomacy be the good way to ensure the voice of reason get through is n't it Kevin unfortunately you be now delve into field I know too little about algorithm your reasoning as I see it be very much along the line of Roger Penrose who claim that mathematical insight can not be algorithmic in his book   the emperor 's new mind concern computer mind and the law of physics   however Penrose 's claim that he   have   mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunction collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusion we be obviouslu take very different viewpoint I try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realise that it might not be anything special but certainly useful think back of what I write do you think worm have mind or not they be able to experience pain at least they behave just like that yet it be conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of C. elegan from the element would such a worm have a mind this be true to some extent however I do not think that our brain work like computer at all in fact there be substantial evidence Skarda 1985- Skarda   Freeman 1987 that brain work more or less chaotically generate enough randomness for mental state to evolve our brain work much like genetic algorithm generator I suppose indeed this be extremely unlikely give the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain I suggest however that before try to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithm Kevin take a look at the reference I mention and think again I still think the good expert on the nature of a conscious mind be neurologist neuropsychologist and biologist but do not flame I for my opinion since they study being that be conscious the reason I be repeat my advice be that this discussion can not lead to anywhere if our background be too different and please do not bring QM into this discussion at all not all physicist be happy with the claim that our consciousness play some special role in physics I would say it does n't again   brain be not computer   do n't forget this this do not mean they need something else to work they just work differently their primary purpose be perception and guidance of action self awareness and high intelligence be later appearance you be still expect that we could find the idea of green in our brain somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical this be not how I see it the sensation green be a certain time dependent pattern in the area v4 of our visual cortex and it be distribute with the help of area V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain indeed a firing pattern I have sometimes think of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing pattern but this be just idle speculation Scientific American 's September 1992 issue be a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover there be two article on visual perception so you might be interested but again please note that subjective experience can not be observe from a third person perspective if we see nothing but neuronal activity we can not go on to conclude that this be not the mind Kalat 1988 write about numerous example where electric stimulation of different area of brain have lead to various change in the patients state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area be stimulate without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview be quickly cure of his depression and start discuss a plan to seduce his girlfriend stimulation in the temporal lobe have sometimes lead to embarrass situation when the patient have start flirt with the therapist in conclusion there be evidence that 1 brain be essentially necessary for subjective experience brain damage be usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage 2 conscious process involve substantial brain activity in various area of brain when we think of colour our visual cortex be activate etc 3 consciousness be an afterthought we become conscious of our action with a half a second delay and our brain be ahead of our conscious will by at least 350 ms thus I think it be fruitful to turn the question why do i see colour around and ask what be this i that seem to be observe since it seem that our conscious mind be not the king of our brain this depend on what be mean by seee colours do a neural network that be capable of recognise handwritten number from 0 to 9 see the number if it be capable of sort they if you be ask why do an animal who be conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who does n't I have a good answer read my previous posting where I write why a sense of identity help social animal to swap role and act more morally so that they do n't unconsciously kill each other with newly discover weapon a bit extreme but this be the basic idea when early   homo   become more and more efficient in use tool a sense of identity and the concept of self have to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for other and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantage for social animal such as early human if mind be require for this do this mean that until human mind come to the scene wavefunction never collapse but remain in the superposition for aeon my how powerful we be this have be discuss before and I think this topic be irrelevant since we do not agree that mind be necessary and neither do physicist I agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physics need sharp mind to solve many real problem It 's ok if you do n't forget to take with you the reference I write about in my previous posting plus the

974;but I believe that there be a fundamental difference here the other x three instrument be focus instrument that more or less form an image so positional error be limit by craft attitude and the resolve power of the optic BATSE be an altogether different beast effectively just 8 coincidence counter one on each corner of the craft positional information be triangulate from the differential signal arrival time at each of the detector positional error would be predominantly determine by time error and error in craft attitude since none of the 8 BASTE detector have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be use to determine parallax indeed parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error demonstrate that these puppy be beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcsecond since the oort cloud be postulate to extend to about 0.5 parsec all together now Parallax ARc SECond a parsec be the distance of an object that demonstrate one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line if the 3 degree accuracy report above be true we 're go to have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline the beauty of BASTE be that it both give positional information and watch the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst be come from;2

977;  in article   1r3tqoookhorus.ap.mchp.sni.de        theism be strongly correlate with irrational belief in absolute irrational      belief in absolute be strongly correlate with fanatism        deletion         Theism be correlate with fanaticism I have neither say that all fanatism      is cause by theism nor that all theism lead to fanatism the point be      theism increase the chance of become a fanatic one could of course      argue that would be fanatic tend towards theism for example but I just      have to loook at the time in history when theism be the dominant ideology      to invalidate that conclusion that that be the basic mechanism behind it          imo the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidate your      assumption that theism be the factor to be consider        Bogus I just say that theism be not the only factor for fanatism     the point be that theism be   a   factor      That be your claim- now back it up I consider your argument as useful    as the following Belief be strongly correlate with fanaticism therefore    belief be   a   factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this    be   any   belief not belief in Gods      tiring to say the least I have back it up read the first statement I have read it conspicuous by its absence be any evidence or point    the latter be the fallacy of the wrong analogy say someone believe   something be hardly an information about the person at all say someone   be a theist hold much more information far the correlation between   theist and fanatism be high than that between belief at all and fanatism   because of the special feature of theistic belief truth by blatant assertion evidence        Gullibility      blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on be all more      reliable indicator and the really dangerous people the source of      fanaticism be often none of these thing they be cynical manipulator      of the gullible who know precisely what they be do        That be a claim you have to support please note that especially in the     field of theism the leader believe what they say      if you believe that you 're incredibly naive      you Frank o'dwyer be live in a dream world I wonder if there be any   base of discussion leave after such a statement as a matter of fact I think   you be ignorant of human nature even when one start with something one do   not believe one get easily fool into actually believe what one say    to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement the onus of proof be on you sunshine what make you think that theist leader believe what they say especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely follow by its opposite the practice be not restrict to theism but it be there for anyone to see It 's almost an epidemic in this country just for instance if it be hard for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle why be the catholic church such a wealthy land owner why be there church to the square inch in my country       now   some       brand of theism and more precisely   some   theist do tend to fanaticism      I grant you to tar all theist with this brush be bigotry not a reasoned      argument and it read to I like a warm up for censorship and restriction      of religious freedom ever read Animal Farm         That be a straw man and as usually in discussion with you one have to     repeat it read what I have write above not every theism lead to     fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism the point be     there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism      no some of it come from feature which   some   theism have in common    with   some   fanaticism your last statement simply is n't imply by    what you say before because you 're try to sneak in innate feature    of   all   theism the word you 're grope for be some      Bogus again not all theism as be be fanatic however the rest already   give backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and   theism and far the specialty of other theistic belief allow they   to switch to fanatism easily it take just a nifty improvement in the   theology truth by blatant assertion       Gullibility by the way be one of they      no shit Sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism    since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as oppose    to the case you be try to make      because there be more about theism that the attraction to gullible people   cause the correlation and the whole discussion start that way by the   statement that theism be meaningfully correlate to fanatism which you   challenge indeed I do as I recall I ask for evidence what be the correlation of which you speak       and to say that I be go to forbid religion be another of your straw     man interesting that you have nothing well to offer      I say it read like a warm up to that That 's because it 's an irrational    and bogus tirade and have no other use than create a nice they   Us    split in the mind of excitable people such as be to be find on either    side of church wall      Blah blah blah I be quite well aware that give everyone their right   protect I well from fanatic than the other way round of course other people be always fanatic never oneself your wish to slur all theist seem pretty fanatical to I    it be quite nice to see that you be actually imply a connection between   that argument and the rise of fanatism so far it be just another of your   assertion so you can do it        2 Define irrational belief e.g. be it rational to believe that        reason be always useful                 irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason the latter have      been discuss for a long time with Charley Wingate one point be that      the belief violate reason often and another that a process that do      not lend itself to rational analysis do not contain reliable information          well there be a glaring paradox here an argument that reason be useful      base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would      be irrational which be it         That 's bogus self reference be not circular and since the evaluation of     usefulness be possible within rational system it be allow      O.K. it 's oval It 's still beg the question however and though    that certainly be allow it 's not rational and you claim to be    rational and all      another of your assertion no proof no evidence just claim hey I learn it from you do I do good      at the risk of repeat myself and hear we have that before   we    did n't hear a   refutation   before so we 're back deal with it      you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful someone    who think reason be crap wo n't buy it you see      that be unusually weak even for you the latter imply that my proof   depend on their opinion somehow who do not accept that there be   triangle wo n't accept Pythagoras wow that be an incredible insight   I do n't have to prove they wrong in their opinion it be possible to   show that their system leave out useful information respectively claim   unreliable or even absurd statement to be information totally circular and totally useless    their wish to believe make they believe thing be judge by their appeal   and not by their information it make you feel good when you believe that   may be good for they but it contain zillion of possible pitfall from   belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proof they attempt truth by blatant assertion i 've see as many bogus proof of the non existence of god as I have of their existence    rational system by the way do not mean that every datum have to come from   logical analysis the point be that the evaluation of the data do not   contradict logic it easily follow that such a system do not allow to   evaluate if its rational in itself yes it be possible to evaluate that   it be rational in a system that be not rational by the fallacy of that   system but since the validity of the axiom be agree upon that have as   little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes this just does n't parse sorry    so far it just a matter of consistency I use ratiional argument to show   that my system be consistent or that theirs is n't the evaluation of the nor this   prediction do not need rationality it do not contradict however       your argument be as silly as prove mathematical statement need mathematic     and mathematic be therfore circular      anybody else think Godel be silly      Stream of consciousness typing what be that suppose to mean        the first part of the second statement contain no information because      you do n't say what the belief be if the belief be strong theism      andor strong atheism then your statement be not in general true the      second part of your sentence be patently false counterexample an      axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysis but be      assume to contain reliable information regardless of what process be      use to obtain it            i 've be speak of religious system with contradictory definition     of god here        an axiomatic datum lend itself to rational analysis what you say here     be a an often refute fallacy have a look at the discussion of the     axiom of choice and far one can evaluate axiom in large system     out of which they be usually derive I exist be derive if you want     it that way        far one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom        what be it you be try to say      that at some point people always wind up say this datum be reliable    for no particular reason at all example I be not dream      Nope there be evidence for it the trick be that the choice of an axiomatic   basis of a system be difficult because the possibility be interweave   one therefore choose that with the least assumption or with assumption   that be necessary to get information out of the system anyway i 'd like to see this allege evidence    one do not need to define axiom in order to define an evaluation method   for usefulness the foundation be lay by how one feel at all that be not   how one feel about it I see you have no irrational belief but then fanatic never do do they       compare the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of      their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational          I ca n't agree with this until you be specific   which   theism to      say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which      I suspect you do not have            use the traditonal definition of god personal supernatural entity     with objective effect on this world usually connect to moral andor     the way the world work      imo any belief about such god be necessarily irrational that do    not mean that people who hold they be in principle oppose to the exercise of    intelligence some atheist be also scientist for example      they do n't use theism when do science or it would n't be science please   note that subjective datum lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well   they just prohibit formulate they as objective statement Ergo nothing be objective Fair enough        the affinity to fanatism be easily see it have to be true because I believe      it be nothing more than a work hypothesis however the belief say they be      more than a work hypothesis          I do n't understand this can you formalise your argument        Person A believe system b becuase it sound so nice that do not make     b true it be at good a work hypothesis however the content of B be that     it be true and that it be more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluate     evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because b already believe     say it be wronG a waste of time not possible depend on the further     content of B Amalekites   idolater   Protestants be to be kill this can     have interesting effect      Peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief    in god entail the further content of which you speak why are n't my    catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example maybe they    do n't believe in it maybe it 's the conjunction of B assert b and    jail   kill dissenter that be important and the belief in god be    entirely irrelevant it certainly seem so to I but then I have no    axe to grind here      the example with your neighbour be a fallacy that   your   neighbour do n't   say little about other and there be time when exactly that happen Nope it be not a fallacy it just does n't go to the correlation you wish to see    and tell I when it be not irrelevant why be such statement about   Amalekites and Idolaters in the Holy Books please note that one could   edit they out when they be not relevant anymore because god do n't err   what do that say about that message excuse I the Holy Books    and how come we have theist say genocide order by god be ok a god   be the easy way to excuse anything and therefore highly attract to   fanatic not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatic can   have on the rest of the believer Happens again and again and again a god be neither the easy way to excuse anything nor the only way;0

Larson be a retired engineer with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University he develop the theory describe in his book while try to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY calculate the property of chemical compound base only on the element they contain the UNIVERSE of MOTION describe the astrophysical portion of Larson 's CONSISTENT INTEGRATED COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe a kind of grand unified field theory that orthodox physicist and astro physicist claim to be look for it be build on two postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe be compose ENTIRELY of one component MOTION exist in three dimension in DISCRETE unit and with two RECIPROCAL aspect SPACE and TIME 2 the physical universe conform to the relation of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematic its primary magnitude be ABSOLUTE and its geometry be EUCLIDEAN from these two postulate Larson be able to build a COMPLETE theoretical universe from photon and subatomic particle to the giant elliptical galaxy by combine the concept of INWARD and OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with translational vibrational rotational and rotational- vibrational motion at each step in the development he be able to match part of his theoretical universe with corresponding part in the real physical universe include even thing not yet discover for example in his 1959 book he first predict the existence of explode galaxy several year before astronomer start find they they be a NECESSARY consequence of his comprehensive theory and when quasar be discover he have a relate explanation ready for those also as a result of his theory which he call the RECIPROCAL SYSTEM Larson TOTALLY reject many of the sacred doctrine of orthodox physicist and astrophysicist include black hole neutron star degenerate matter quantum wave mechanic as apply to atomic structure nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass increase relativistic Doppler shift nuclear fusion in star and the big bang all of which he consider to be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL fantasy he be very critical of the ad HOC assumption uncertainty principle solution in principle no other way declaration etc use to maintain they the UNIVERSE of MOTION be divide into 31 chapter it begin with a description of how galaxy be build from the gravitational attraction between globular star cluster which be form from intergalactic gas and dust cloud that accumulate from the decay product of cosmic ray come in from the ANTI matter HALF of the physical universe galaxy formation from the MYTHICAL big bang be a big mystery to orthodox astronomer he then go on to describe life cycle of star and how binary and multiple star system and solar system result from Type I supernova explosion of single star several chapter be devoted to quasar which accord to Larson be densely pack cluster of star that have be eject from the central bulge of explode galaxy and be actually travel faster than the speed of light although most of that speed be away from US in TIME astronomer and astrophysicist who run up against observation that contradict their theory would find Larson 's explanation quite valuable if consider with an open MIND for example they use to believe that GAMMA RAY BURSTS originate from pulsar which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observe that the burst come from all direction uniformly and do not correspond with any visible object except for a few case of directional coincidence Larson 's explanation be that the gamma ray burst originate from SUPERNOVA explosion in the ANTI matter half of the physical universe which Larson call the cosmic sector because the anti matter universe exist in a RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe with the speed of light as the BOUNDARY between they and have three dimension of time and only one dimension of space the burst can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly at random Larson heavily quote or paraphrase statement from book journal article and lead physicist and astronomer in this book 351 of they be superscripte with number identify entry in the reference list at the end of the book for example a quote from the book astronomy the Cosmic Journey by William K. Hartmann say our hope of understand all star would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple star form unfortunately we can not Larson 's book contain LOGICAL consistent explanation of such mystery that be worthy of serious consideration by all physicist astronomer and astrophysicist for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited SOURCES Larson 's BOOKS UN altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this IMPORTANT Book Review be encouraged;2

1076;Anton LaVey 's interpretation of Satanism have always puzzle I I read his Satanic Bible a few year ago for a social study project as well as a book by Arthur Lyons call the cult of Devil Worship in America the latter include a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he do indeed say that Satan be merely an instrument for one to realize the self when I refer to Satanism I be refer to the mishmash of rural satanic ritualism and witchcraft which exist before the Church of Satan I do n't consider LaVey 's church to be at all orthodox nor do I consider its follower satanist LaVey combine the philosophy of Nietzsche Crowley and Reich slap in some religious doctrine add a little touch of P.T. Barnum and christen his creation the Church of Satan no doubt the title be a calculated attempt to attract attention I suppose he could have just as easily call it the Church of Free Sex at any rate it work for a while in its heyday the Church have a huge following include such Hollywood celebrity as Sammy Davis Jr. and Jayne Mansfield I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy by the way I find the idea of a Satanist not believe in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believe in Christ but if you include the Church of Satan then I suppose I need to alter my definition Webster 's Dictionary and the American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same;0

1161;diplomatic I realize I 'm fight Occam 's razor in this argument so I 'll try to explain why I feel a mind be necessary firstly I 'm not impressed with the ability of algorithm They 're great at solve problem once the method have be work out but not at work out the method itself as a specific example I like to solve numerical crossword not the simple do the sums and insert the answer type the hard one to do these with any efficiency you need to figure out a variety of trick now I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzle but in do so you have to work out the trick   yourself   and program they into the computer you can of course obfuscate the trick and write the program so that it be uncover but as far as I can see the trick still have to be there in some form to be discover do this mean that all the idea we will ever have be already pre program into our brain this be somewhat unlikely give that our brain ultimately be encode in 46 chromosome worth of genetic material much of which is n't use one way around this be to bring the environment into the equation but again as far as I can see this still have an air of if you see object x then perform action Y and we do n't seem to get anywhere the algorithm have to anticipate what it might see and what conclusion to draw from it 's experience the other problem with algorithms be their instability not many algorithm survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive stroke without go completely haywire there be side effect but patient still seem remarkably stable also neuron in perfectly healthy people be die at an alarming rate can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bit of it 's code the next problem be the sticky question of what be colour replace colour with the sensation of your choice presumably the materialist viewpoint be that it 's the product of some kind of chemical reaction the usual product of such a reaction be energy   different chemical be colour a mixture of these if this be so a computer wo n't see colour because the chemistry be different do an algorithm that see colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that does n't it should n't because the output of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstance so why do we see colour a bit of idle speculation if I remember correctly quantum mechanic consist of a wavefunction with two process act on it the first process have be call unitary Evolution or U be govern by schroedinger 's equation and be well know the second process call various thing such as collapse of the wavefunction or state vector reduction or R and be more mysterious it be usually say to occur when a measurement take place although nobody seem to know precisely when that occur when it do occur the effect of r be to abruptly change the wavefunction I envisage r as an interaction between the wavefunction and somethe else which I shall imaginitively call part x. it seem reasonable to assume that   something   cause r although that something might be the wavefunction itself in which case part x be simply the wavefunction note though that we 'd need more than U to explain R. anyway I 'm speculate that mind would be in part X. there seem to be some link between consciousness and r in that we never see linear superposition of anything although there be alternative explaination for this i 've no idea how a brain be suppose to access part x but since this be only speculation that wo n't matter too much my main point be that there might be a place for mind in physics I 'll go back to my nice pad cell now if that be ok with you Kevin Anthoney kaxcs.nott.ac.uk do n't believe anything you read in .sig file;0

1177;in   1993apr24.214843.10940midway.uchicago.edu   eeb1quads.uchicago.edu I already respond to this on one dimension but afterthought cause I to make another independent reply the problem with a moment of silence be that it be not an even handed way of allow for religion amongst student in the public school as I note before Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayer they be require by Muhammad to do and at least orthodox jewish prayer also have requirement that be not address by this there be in fact a highly selective bias towards christian prayer in this moment of silence shit and that be especially bizarre in that christian prayer DOESN'T need this stuff a Christain may pray totally incognito AT any TIME to some extent this be true of Muslims and Jews as well what I intend in my first paragraph be that there   be   some characteristic form of prayer in   these   religion which do need special time andor behavior which can not be undertake without an observer be able taking note of it a Christian may pray at any time silently and without any trace of his activity be evident to other that may or may not be true of the other religious tradition amongst we certainly these tend to have some form of prayer that would evidence difference from American   protestant mainstream religion all that a moment of silence do be to allow that one tradition which does n't need it to have a special place set aside in the public school there be nothing in christian prayer that require public form or rug or phylactery or anything else at all visible to the outside world a christian student MAY and probably do pray at innumerable time during the day without anyone else know it   that may also be true of non- Christians I be not claimng otherwise   in the moment of silence it would still be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven for the Muslims to do their ablution and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed form but   of course   Christians can do   their   thing and therefore the provision be nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that luckily there   be   a strong jewish presence in this country and I as a Christian revere some of the jewish teacher I have in public school and a grow muslim presence as well I can only hope that the political force consequent on this will prevent the imposition of christian form on non Christians as far as I can see as a Christian there be nothing in this moment of silence campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to force child to adhere to a pattern that be bias towards Christianity and as a Christian I   must   protest such coercion for what it 's worth I suspect that the coercion be not really target at the non Christians it be yet another case of failure amongst christian parent in make their child prayerful so that they want the public school to teach what they can not manage to teach despite have all the opportunity in the world to do so if you have teach your child to pray they do not need a moment of silence in school if you have not manage to teach they the moment will only embarrass you give it up;3

1187;I think this should be illuminate to all let I make a first suggestion when arabic word especially technical one become of use let we define they for those especially atheist to whom they may not be terribly familiar please also note that though I do initially refer to Khomeini as a heretic for what I understand to be a claim reject by you since of personal infallibility I withdraw this as a basis for such a statement I conditionally retain this reference in regard to Khomeini 's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the so call Twelve Imams which be in clear conflict with the Qur'an in that it place the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example high than that of the Muhammad in that the Qur'an show that the Prophet be clearly fallible as well as it appear give your abstruse theological statment regard the nature of the Twelve Imams place they in a different metaphysical category than the remainder of humanity with the possible exception of Muhammad something which verge on the sin of association Alaikum Wassalam;0

1199;I have some color gif which I would like to archive in a much small size use a grayscale palette of 16 shade the quantization to 16 gray introduce some ugly band in the picture which can be nicely eliminate by dither up to now I have use XV to process the image but now I would like to automate the procedure the problem be that XV ca n't I think convert image automatically and the obvious alternative pnmplus PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER do n't even get close to XV 's quality PNMDITHER apparently dither in RGB even though the image be in grayscale the dither routine in XV seem to use the natural image color for the dither be this or any similar routine available in the public domain if so where;1
1200;I use Arts   Letters on a pc and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences it trace beautifully but there 's a trick to trace I 've trace entire cartoon image into custom clip art but you ca n't expect to just point to the image and get it just like that it take a little work in some case a lot of work you need to trace a drawing piece by piece and then put it together it 's kinda hard to explain in type but if you 're ever in Reno I can give you a little demonstration;1

1205;yes that be exactly what I feel my heart just feel that what I be be teach be   wrong   a basically good message but frame in error I could not with a clear conscience accept that woman be somehow not equal to man that homosexual be guilty of their lifestyle that pride in one 's work be a bad thing that Jesus die for I I do n't want ANYBODY to die for I especially as an impersonal act where the person ca n't possibly even   know   I well enough to really know if I 'm worth die for or not I be never able to accept the bit about Jesus 's death be a good thing if that mean that I 'm just not comprehend a basic message of Christianity then so be it maybe I 'm just not compatible with Christianity I just refuse to follow rule blindly and since I ca n't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you describe it I 've get to just follow my own conscience in these matter do n't think that my moral be shoddy or nonexistent just because I do n't believe in your god I will not steal and I will not murder not because I fear divine repudiation but because these just   are n't   in my character you may think there 's nothing keep I from just run around on a murdering spree steal thing when I 'm able insult people for the heck of it because I 'm not answerable to anyone- but you 'd be wrong I 'm answerable to myself a life like that would be a cheap life- I happen to want to earn respect in myself my initial break with Christianity come after a lot of soul searching and a lot of wonder why I could no long feel the presence of God with I I finally decide that I have once feel this presence just as I have feel my mighty teddy bear beside I when I be a little tyke protect I from the monster under the bed that I have believe in God just as I have believe in the teddy bear as something of an emotional crutch to protect I from perceive danger since then I 've never abandon the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity do exist but there be a few time when in my darken room by my bed I have set aside everything I believe for a moment and call out to whatever 's out there because I want to know the truth even if it mean abandon everything I know and I have not yet receive an answer Nope it may well be unknowable scientist have suggest that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the three dimensional universe may be map onto a four dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two dimensional plane onto a three dimensional sphere- see   sphereland   the sequel to   Flatland   for more thought on this our entire universe might just be an electron in a four- dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variable become too much for we to even speculate on that be there 's no possible way for we to know exactly how we come to be so there 's no reason at all to believe that your God exist nor have anything to do with it Christians have provide I with nothing except quote from your holy book and all sort of tactic to try to get I to believe guilt trip insinuation that I 'm without moral argument from disbelief how can you possibly believe that God   does n't   exist and so forth all I 'm ask be for you to convince I I want to be convince but it be not go to be easy having have year upon year of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside I view it as harmful in many way it prey on people who want to find meaning in their life and once it 's get these people it teach they to have pity and sometimes starkly intolerant of other who do not share these view maybe you 'll say that your religion does n't teach that but I 've get to judge Christianity from the Christians I know I feel that it be entirely possible and good to have faith in one 's self and to be a positive influence on society for no well reason than that so I hope that my word in this newsgroup will at least make some people think I want Christians to realize that there be perfectly valid lifestyle and opinion that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever and I want people who be consider Christianity to realize that Christianity do not hold the sole key to a happy fulfilled life I have know some very nice Christians who have do some very nice thing I think what set these people apart from the general masse be that they recognize that their religious belief may be wrong and they know the weakness of their religion yet they still decide to believe but they keep their belief to themselves and do not think any less of people who do n't agree with they precisely my point you 've still not give I a reason to be a Christian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem just as the Moslems are n't religious and the Buddhists are n't religious who   be   religious then;3
1206;we here at IBM have the same problem with our workstation I be also shock when I first realize that you have to offset line from fill by about 16 bit assume 24 bit z buffer this seem huge but be only 1256 of the dynamic range in those term it does n't seem so bad what be happen be that the interpolation in z be not totally linear due mainly to roundoff I believe so the polygon be not planar in z but be more like a Ruffles potato chip ditto with line when you start   end at different x   y value the ridge be out of phase result in the stitch effect you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another but with different vertex you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap example try Polygon 1 100,100,100 100,200,100 200,200,100 200,100,100 Polygon 2 125,125,100 125,175,100 175,175,100 175,125,100 your implementation be correct in fact we do a similar trick when render primitive that have line and polygon such as NURBS surface with isoparametric line without the trick the line appear stitch as you say when the application draw line   polygon independently the system do not have the smart to automatically do the z shift so the application must do it this be what you have discover and be do Bravo note to ibm'er the information give here have be previously disclose through proper channel so i 'm not give away any new unpublished info;1

1226;    I be a relativist who would like to answer your question but the way you phrase the question make it unanswerable the concept of right and wrong or correct   incorrect or true   false belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral question it make no sense to ask if a moral position be right or wrong although it be legitimate to ask if it be good or well than another position let I illustrate this point by look at the psychological derivative of epistemology and ethic perception and motivation respectively one can certainly ask if a percept be right correct true veridical or wrong incorrect false illusory but it make little sense to ask if a motive be true or false on the other hand it be strange to ask whether a percept be morally good or evil but one can certainly ask that question about motive therefore your suggest answer a)-(c simply ca n't be consider they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment now the problem with d be that it be double barrel I agree with the first part that the rightness of a moral position be a meaningless question for the reason state above but that be irrelevant to the alleged implication not an implication at all that one can not feel peace be well than war I certainly can make value judgment bad well well without assert the correctness of the position sorry for the lengthy dismissal of a)-(d my short e answer be that when two individual grotesquely disagree on a moral issue neither be right correct or wrong incorrect they simply hold different moral value feeling;0

field with the reward of iniquity- and fall headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowel gush out Matt 27:5 7 and he Judas cast down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself and the chief priest buy with they the potter 's field before the cock crow Matthew 26:34 before the cock crow twice Mark 14:30 MAR 14:72 and the second time the cock crew and Peter call to mind the word that Jesus say unto he before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny I thrice and when he think thereon he weep MAT 26:74 then begin he to curse and to swear say I know not the man and immediately the cock crew MAT 26:75 and Peter remember the word of Jesus which say unto he before the cock crow thou shalt deny I thrice and he go out and weep bitterly LUK 22:60 and Peter say Man I know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew luk 22:61 and the Lord turn and look upon Peter and Peter remember the word of the Lord how he have say unto he before the cock crow thou shalt deny I thrice JOH 13:38 Jesus answer he Wilt thou lie down thy life for my sake verily verily I say unto thee the cock shall not crow still thou hast deny I thrice JOH 18:27 Peter then deny again and immediately the cock crew this be interesting because Matthew quote a prophesy that be never make not the only time he do this either MAT 27:9 then be fulfil that which be speak by Jeremy the prophet say and they take the thirty piece of silver the price of he that be value whom they of the child of Israel do value- zechariah 11:11 13 nothing in Jeremiah remotely like what be

say many stand far off include Mary Magdaline Mary the mother of James and the mother of Zebedee 's child Mark and Luke speak of many far off and Mark include Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less John say that Jesus 's mother stand at the cross along with her sister and Mary Magdalene Matt.27:46,50 and about the ninth hour Jesus cry with a loud voice say Eli eli lama sabachthani that be to say my God my God why hast thou forsake I Jesus when he cry again with a loud voice yield u the ghost luke23:46 and when Jesus have cry with a loud voice he say Father unto thy hand I commend my spirit and having say thus he give up the ghost John19:30 when Jesus therefore have receive the vinegar he say it be finish and he bow his head and give up the ghost Matthew say that the veil of the temple be rent that there be an earthquake and that it be dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that grave open and body of the saint arise and go into Jeruselem appear to many beat Jesus to the resurection Mark and Luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple be rent but mention no earthquake or risen saint John be the only one who mention Jesus 's side be peirce Matthew say the Jews ask Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from be steal by the disciple and for the tomb to be seal all of this be supposedly do but the other gospel do not mention these precaution depend where you look- Matthew 12:40 give Jesus prophesy that he will spend three day and three night in the heart of the earth and Mark 10:34 have after three day meta treis emeras he will rise again as far as I can see from a quick look the prophecy have after three day but the post resurrection narrative have on the third day Matthew say Sunday at dawn Mark say the sun be rise and John say it be dark MAT 28:1 in the end of the sabbath as it begin to dawn toward the first day of the week come Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre MAR 16:1 and when the sabbath be past Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome have buy sweet spice that they might come and anoint he JOH 20:1 the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it be yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone take away from the sepulchre MAT 28:2 and behold there be a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descend from heaven and come and roll back the stone from the door and sit upon it MAT 28:3 his countenance be like lightning and his raiment white as snow MAT 28:4 and for fear of he the keeper do shake and become as dead man MAT 28:5 and the angel answer and say unto the woman fear not ye for I know that ye seek Jesus which be crucify MAR 16:5 and enter into the sepulchre they see a young man sit on the right side clothe in a long white garment- and they be affright LUK 24:4 and it come to pass as they be much perplexed thereabout behold two man stand by they in shine garment JOH 20:12 and seeth two angel in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the foot where the body of Jesus have lie Matthew say the guard be pay to tell this story but no other gospel make this claim Matthew say an angel at the tomb tell the two Marys and that Jesus also tell they to tell the disciple to meet he in Galilee the disciple then go to a mountain previously agree opon and meet Jesus there this be his only appearance except to the woman at the tomb Matthew only devote five verse to the visit with the disciple Mark say that Jesus walk with two of the disciple in the country and that they tell the rest of the disciple who refuse to believe later he appear to the 11 disciple at mealtime Luke say two follower go the same day that Jesus rise from the dead to Emmaus a village eight mile from Jeruselem and there Jesus jione they but be unrecognised while they eat a meal together that evening they finally recognise Jesus whereopon he dissapeare return at once to Jeruselem they tell the disciple of their experience and suddenly Jesus appear among they frighten they as they think he be a spirit Jesus then eat some fish and honey and then preach to they John say Jesus appear to the disciple the evening of the day he arrose in Jeruselem where they be hide he breathe the Holy Ghost opon they but Thomas be not present and refuse to believe eight day later Jesus join the disciple again at the same place and this time he convince Thomas.tOnce more Jesus make an appearance to the disciple at the sea of Tiberias but again be not recognise after tell they to cast their netson the other side of the boat Jesus becomes know to they and prepare bread and fish for they they all eat together and converse the book of act far add to the confusion it say that Jesus show himself to the apostle for a period of 40 day after his resurection thus contradict Matthew Mark Luke and John and speak to they of thing pertain to the kingdom of God and when he have speak these thing while they beheld he be take up- and a cloud recieve he out of their sight and while they look steadfastly toward heaven as he go up two man stand by they in white apparel which also say ye man of Galilee why stand ye gaze into heaven this same Jesus which be take from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have see he go into heaven act 1:3 11 Paul outdo every other authority by say that Jesus be see by 500 person between the time of the resurection and the assension although he do not say where.the also claim that he himself as one bear out of due time also see Jesus 1 Cor 15:6 8 Matthew say nothing about it.tmark casually say that Jesus be recieve into heaven after he be finish talk with the disciple in Jeruselem Luke say Jesus lead the desciple to Bethany and that while he bless they he be part from they and carry up into heaven John say nothing about it act contradict all of the above see previous section MAT 24:34 verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these thing be fulfil MAR 13:30 verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these thing be do LUK 21:32 verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfil 1 thessalonian 4:15 18 1 Corinthians 15:5 12 Matthew 27:3 5 minus one

heaven 2 king 2:11 tno man hath ascend up to heaven but he that come down from heaven t the Son of Man John 3:13 as you can see there be a number of contradiction in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of Jesus if these be good witness you would think that they could get some of these important detail right in fact I can not find very many point on where they agree you would think that they could at least agree on some of the point they be supposedly observe because of the fact that there be so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection as present can not be take as literal truth due to the nature of the story I doubt if it should be take as any sort of truth;0

1258;well it be not that simple you 're in Earth 's magnetic field and you do n't generate electricity but it can be do the way you power thing be with electricity so the answer to the first question be definitely yes if you mean to say propel rather than power the answer be sort of yes you can use interaction with the Earth 's magnetic field to get electrical power and there be potential application for this however bear in mind that there be no free lunch the energy is n't come from nowhere what such system do be convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy there be case where this be a useful tradeoff use power obtain in this way for propulsion be useful only in special situation however what you   can   do be get your power by some other mean e.g. solar array and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse pump energy   into   the orbit rather than take energy out of it if you want more information try look up electrodynamic propulsion tether application and magsail no a dragless satellite do not magically have no drag- it burn fuel constantly to fight drag maintain the exact orbit it would have   if   there be no drag this be why there be quote around dragless;2

1263;fc   exactly what fraction of current research be do on the big fc   visable light telescope from what I 've see 10 or less fc   down from amlost 100 25 year ago that sound like die fc   to I that does n't seem like a fair comparison infrared astronomy did n't really get start until something like 25 yr ago- it did n't explode until IRAS in 1983 Gamma ray and I think x ray observation did n't really get start until the 70s I believe the same be true of ultraviolet observation in general and I know that extreme uv short of 1000 angstrom observation until the euve launch last year have almost no history except a few observation on Skylab in the 70s twenty five year ago the vast majority of astronomer only have access to optical or radio instrument now with far more instrument available growth in some of these new field have result in optical work represent a small fraction of total astronomical work fc   that would be true if adaptive optic work well in the visable fc   but take a look at the paper on the subject they refer to anything fc   up to 100 micron as visable I do n't know about you but most fc   people have trouble see beyond 7 micron or so there be fc   reason to think adaptive optic will not work at short fc   wavelength without truely radical improvement in technology Hmm some of the folk in this department planning on use adaptive optic at the 5 m at Palomar for near infrared observation 1 and 2 micron might be surprised to hear this and is n't the NTT already push toward 0.1 arcsecond resolution from a ground base site remember 0.1 arcsecond be one of the selling point of HST;2

1265;the follow partial summary of a theory of the Universe include a little know description of the CREATION of our Solar System LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics Orthodox physicist astronomer and astrophysicist claim to be look for a Unified field theory in which all of the force of the universe can be explain with a single set of law or equation but they have be systematically ignore or suppress an excellent one for 30 year the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe which he call the Reciprocal System be build on two fundamental postulate about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe be compose ENTIRELY of one component MOTION exist in three dimension in DISCRETE unit and in two RECIPROCAL form SPACE and TIME 2 the physical universe conform to the relation of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematic its magnitude be ABSOLUTE and its geometry be EUCLIDEAN from these two postulate Larson develop a COMPLETE theoretical Universe use various combination of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational- rotational motion the concept of IN ward and OUT ward SCALAR MOTIONS and speed in relation to the Speed of Light which Larson call UNIT VELOCITY and the NATURAL DATUM at each step in the development Larson be able to MATCH object in his theoretical Universe with object in the REAL physical universe photon sub atomic particle   INCOMPLETE ATOMS   charge atom molecule globular star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white dwarf star pulsar quasar ETC even object not yet discover then such as EXPLODING galaxy and GAMMA RAY BURSTS and apply his theory to his new model of the atom Larson be able to precisely and accurately calculate inter- atomic distance in crystal and molecule compressibility and thermal expansion of solid and other property of matter all of this be describe in good detail with OUT fancy complex mathematic in his book BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson the following be a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe some of the early book be out of print now but still available through inter library loan the Structure of the Physical Universe 1959 the case against the Nuclear Atom 1963 beyond Newton 1964 New Light on Space and Time 1965 Quasars and Pulsars 1971 nothing but MOTION 1979   a   9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the   8.3 billion Super Collider    the last four chapter explain chemical bonding   the Neglected Facts of Science 1982 the UNIVERSE of MOTION 1984   FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery   BASIC property of matter 1988 all but the last of these book be publish by North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland or 97213 and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library does n't have each of they several of they include the last one be available from the International Society of Unified Science ISUS 1680 E. Atkin Ave Salt Lake City Utah 84106 this be the organization that be start to promote Larson 's theory they have other related publication include the quarterly journal RECIPROCITY Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson be a retired engineer Chemical or Electrical he be about 91 year old when he die in May 1989 he have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University he develop his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe while try to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical property base only on the element use Larson 's lack of a fancy ph.d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore he but it be not a VALID reason sometimes it take a relative outsider to CLEARLY see the forest through the TREES at the same time it be clear from his book that he also know ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction AD HOC assumption principle of IMPOTENCE IN CONSISTENCIES ETC Larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it be not necessary for he to do so he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational datum and in many case his explanation FIT BETTER a self consistent theory be much MORE than the ORTHODOX physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for a unified field theory that work but have be ignore one for over 30 year now modern physics do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of Larson 's book be full of quotation of lead orthodox physicist and astronomer who agree and remember that epicycle crystal sphere geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seem to explain it well but be later prove CONCEPTUALLY wrong Prof. Frank H. Meyer Professor Emeritus of UW Superior be   be a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson 's theory and be or still be President of Larson 's organization the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY of UNIFIED SCIENCE and Editor of their quarterly Journal RECIPROCITY he move to Minneapolis after retire Super Collider BOONDOGGLE I be against contruction of the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas or anywhere else it would be a gross WASTE of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value Most physicist do n't realize it but accord to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson as describe in his book the strange GOOFY particle meson hyperon ALLEGED quark etc which they be find in existing collider Fermi Lab Cern etc be really just ATOMS of ANTI MATTER which be create by the high energy colliding beam and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment a large and more expensive collider will only create a few more element of anti matter that the physicist have not see there before and the physicist will be even more confuse than they be now be a few more type of anti matter atom worth the   8.3 billion cost do n't we have much more important use for this waste money another thing to consider be that the primary propose location in Texas have a serious and grow problem with some kind of fire ant eat the insulation off underground cable how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticide will be require to keep the ant out of the Supercollider name the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as propose be TOTALLY ABSURD if it be build it should be name after a lead particle physicist LARSONIAN Anti Matter in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe anti matter be not a simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it have more to do with the rate of vibration and rotation of the photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which Larson call Unit Velocity and the Natural Datum in Larson 's theory a positron be actually a particle of MATTER not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in Larson 's theory the ANTI matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of TIME and only one dimension of space and exist in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half LARSONIAN Relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury have be observe and precisely measure to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 second of arc per century 531 second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet Venus Earth Jupiter etc the remain 43 second of arc be be use to help prove Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity but the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieve result close to the 43 second than General Relativity can by instead use SPECIAL relativity in one or more of his book he apply the LORENTZ transformation on the high orbital speed of Mercury Larson TOTALLY reject General Relativity as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY he also reject most of Special Relativity include the part about mass increase near the speed of light and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shift great than 1.000 REALLY be move fast than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from we in TIME in Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure be the CLOCK time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be NEGLIGIBLE- but at high speed they become significant and the Lorentz Transformation must be use as a FUDGE FACTOR   Larson often use the term coordinate TIME when write about this   in regard to mass increase it have be prove in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration   FORCE   MASS a   F   m Orthodox physicist be ignore the THIRD factor FORCE in Larson 's theory mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drop toward zero FORCE be actually a motion or combination of motion or relation between motion include INward and OUTward SCALAR motion the expansion of the universe for example be an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so call Big Bang which be yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY the UNIVERSE of MOTION I wish to recommend to everyone the book the UNIVERSE of MOTION by Dewey B. Larson 1984 North Pacific Publishers P.O. Box 13255 Portland Oregon 97213 456 page index hardcover it contain the astrophysical portion of a GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by that author an UNrecognized geniu more than thirty year ago it contain FINAL solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the FORMATION of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true ORIGIN of the 3 degree background radiation cosmic ray and gamma- ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarf explode galaxy etc it contain what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the following be an example of his Theory 's success in his first book in 1959 the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE Larson predict the existence of EXPLODING galaxy several year before astronomer start find they they be a NECESSARY consequence of Larson 's comprehensive theory and when QUASARS be discover he have an immediate relate explanation for they also GAMMA RAY BURSTS Astro physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious GAMMA RAY BURSTS they be originally think to originate from neutron star in the disc of our galaxy but the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit have be detect they in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any known object except for a few case of directional coincidence Gamma ray burst be a NECESSARY consequence of the GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson accord to page 386 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION publish in 1984 the gamma ray burst be come from SUPERNOVA explosion in the ANTI matter HALF of the physical universe which Larson call the Cosmic Sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with known object and come from all direction uniformly I wonder how close to we in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the MASS extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby GAMMA RAY BURSTS LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of they but binary star system be actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson I will try to summarize Larsons explanation which be detail in chapter 7 of his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION and in some of his other book first of all accord to Larson star do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the COMPLETE annihilation of heavy element heavy than IRON each element have a destructive TEMPERATURE LIMIT the heavy the element be the low be this limit a star 's internal temperature increase as it grow in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of light and light element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of IRON there be a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION this be because there be so much iron present- and that be relate to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which Larson explain in some of his book   well than I can   when the star explode the light material on the outer portion of the star be blow outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavy material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expand OUTWARD in TIME which be equivalent to inward in SPACE and it often actually disappear for a while over long period of time both masse start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blow outward in space now start to form a red GIANT star the material that have be blow OUTWARD in TIME start to form a WHITE DWARF star both star then start move back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the H R Diagram the chance of the two masse fall back into the exact same location in space make a single lone star again be near zero they will instead form a BINARY system orbit each other accord to Larson a white dwarf star have an inverse DENSITY gradient be dense at its SURFACE because the material at its center be most widely disperse blow outward in time this eliminate the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL fantasy about degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc LARSONIAN Solar System Formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be SEVERAL mini white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affect by its heat etc these will become PLANETS in chapter 7 of the UNIVERSE of MOTION Larson use all this information and other principle of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode 's Law Black Hole FANTASY I hear that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently complete a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black hole merge together into a single black hole and conclude that the new black hole would have MORE mass than the sum of the two original black hole such a result should be recognize by everyone as a RED FLAG cause widespread doubt about the whole IDEA of black hole etc after read Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's book about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe especially his book the UNIVERSE of MOTION it be clear to I that black hole be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL fantasy the strange object at Cygnus X-1 be just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want to prove their theory by the way I do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist Stephen Hawking the physicist and astronomer seem to be act as if Hawking 's severe physical problem somehow make he wise it do not I wish the same attention have be give to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he be still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to Larson 's theory book and organization the International Society of Unified Science ELECTRO MAGNETIC PROPULSION I hear of that concept many year ago in connection with UFO 's and unorthodox inventor but I never be able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct I find a possible clue about why they might work on page 112 113 of the book BASIC property of MATTER by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson which describe part of Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe I quote one paragraph as indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrive at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it be bring out in volume I   Larson 's book nothing but MOTION   that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorb by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited it follow that there be always a large excess of free electron in the material sector   material half   of the universe most of which be uncharged in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remain permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregate be thus expose to a flux of electron similar to the continual bombardment by photon of radiation meanwhile there be other process to be discuss later whereby electron be return to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilize at an equilibrium level note that in Larson 's theory UNcharged electron be also massLESS and be basically photon of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spin around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity be the speed of light and there be vibrational and rotational equivalent to the speed of light accord to Larson 's theory   I might have the above and below label mix up   Larson be say that outer space be fill with mass- LESS UN charge electron fly around at the speed of light if this be true then the ELECTRO MAGNETIC propulsion field of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electron or other particle in space perhaps give they a charge and mass and shoot they toward the rear to achieve propulsion in Larson 's theory an electrical charge be a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimpose on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quote above might also give a clue to confused meteorologist about how and why lightning be generate in cloud suppression of LARSONIAN Physics the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED theory of the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson have be available for more than 30 year publish in 1959 in his first book the structure of the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE it be TOTALLY UN SCIENTIFIC for Hawking Wheeler Sagan and the other sacred priest of the religion they call science or physic or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education system to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson 's theory have they have Larson 's theory have excellent explanation for many thing now puzzle orthodox physicist and astronomer such as gamma ray burst and the nature of quasar Larson 's theory deserve to be HONESTLY and openly discuss in the physics chemistry and astronomy journal in the U.S. and elsewhere and at least the basic principle of Larson 's theory should be include in all related course at UW EC UW Madison Cambridge Cornell University and elsewhere so that student be not keep in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they be be feed for more information answer to your question etc please consult my cited source especially Larson 's BOOKS UN altered REPRODUCTION and dissemination of this important partial summary be ENCOURAGED;3

1267;Sorry but yes he do by your own description humorous this notion of an all know all powerful god who must attempt to reconcile with his lowly creation I realize that it be not possible to penetrate such logic but be there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything and far that an attempt to reconcile imply a lack of omniscience what you be do here be project human weakness onto your god but all human be sinner thus all pre jesus human should have be punish with death we are n't punish with sin now of course because God have change he require a brutal sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow we to sin without immediate death yet he do so now he have change the sadistic murder of his own son have make he more tolerant of our sin besides his midst be everywhere so your statement be meaningless he tolerate sin in Hell which surely be in his midst as well also give that he be all know he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sin as well as when and where so what do tolerance have to do with anything all of this be absolute nonsense unless your god be not indeed all knowing and all powerful or unless he does n't take the personal interest in everyday affair that you claim not relevant the claim of kindness and lovingness be make by you in reference to your god the nature of his creation   victim be not at issue I see an all know god who do not know what the ultimate outcome would be and an all powerful god who have no choice in the matter mindmush do I miss something do you give some indication at to why a KIND and love god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his own botched creation to achieve salvation I note that your answer physically follow my question but I fail to discern a connection between the two by the way for what be I be console why not by the way I note for the record that you did n't answer the question Death andor eternal damnation be your idea of correctional punishment I hope you are n't a parent this be quite an elaborate fantasy that you 've construct but sadly it lack a basis in reality it also do not address the question that I raise the god that you describe be not a good parent but a tyrant sorry be that the god of the Bible whose rule I be to follow or the god of the Koran the Vedas the Book of Koresh oh yes it 's all so clear;3

1289;in the King James Version of the Bible there be three different word translate into the word hell these greek word have totally different meaning the word be Hades Tartaros and Gehenna in bibical usage the greek word Hades be use only 11 time in the New Testament and be roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol mean the grave or pit compare act 2:27 with Psalms 16:10 Hades may be liken to a hole in the ground in the Bible it have nothing to do with fire Most modern bibical translator admit that the use in the english word hell to translate Hades and Sheol be an unfortunate and misleading practice why because when see the word hell many reader impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever burn inferno when this be never remotely intend in the greek language or in Old English in its true bibical usage Hades do indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead but not in the sense of spirit walk around in some sort of shadowy realm Hades be simply the abode we call the grave all dead go to this hell the second hell of the Bible Tartaros be mention only once in scripture 2 pet.2:4- for if God spare not the angel that sin but cast they down to hell TARTAROS and deliver they into chain of darkness to be reserve unto judgment follow their rebellion to unseat God from his throne Isa.14:12 14- Rev.12:4 the archangel Lucifer now Satan and a third of the create angel now demon be eject from heaven Luke 10:18 they be cast down to tartaro a place or condition of restraint that God have impose on the mutinous angel as they await ultimate judgment Jude 6- 1 Cor.6:3 tartaro then be a hell that apply only to evil rebellious angel or demon it be interesting that the ancient Greeks use this word to describe the place in which Zeus confine the rebellious Titans nowhere in the Bible be there any mention of man be put into this particular hell the the third word that be translate as hell in the Bible be Gehenna it come from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM mean valley of Hinniom Hinnom be a deep narrow ravine locate to the south and southwest of Jerusalem in Old Testament time it be a place of abominable pagan rite include infant sacrifice it be there that the apostate king Ahaz and Manasseh make their child pass through the fire to the god Molech the rite be specifically celebrate in Tophet the place of abhorrence one of the chief grove in the valley King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abomination he defile the valley render it ceremonially unclean 2 king 23:10 later the valley become the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem- a repository for sewage refuse and animal carcass the body of dispise criminal be also burn there along with the rubbish fire burn continuously feed by a constant supply of garbage and refuse Aceldama the field of blood purchase with the money Judas receive for the betrayal of Christ Matt.27:8 be also in part of the valley of Hinnom so what do this valley call Gehenna have to do with hell in Rev.19:20 the Satan inspire political dictator and a miracle work religious figure the False Prophet work with he will resist the re establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at his second coming their fate be reveal by the apostle John and the beast be take and with he the false prophet these both be cast alive into a lake of fire burn with brimstone where will this temporary lake of fire this hell be the prophet Isaiah write of this lake of fire prepare for the Beast for Tophet in the valley of Hinnom be ordain of old yea for the king it be prepare he hath make it deep and large the pile thereof be fire and wood the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it Isa.30:33 one thousand year later Satan himself will be cast into this rekindle fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet be cast Rev.20:10 but what of the wicked who have die over the millennia do the Bible say that they be now suffer fiery punishment for their sin in a lake of fire in the sequence of rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked be resurrect to be throw into the lake of fire after Satan be cast there rev.20:15 what will become of these wicked will they writhe in flame for eternity the wicked will be burn up from the intense heat of the come Gehenna fire on the earth they wil be consume annihilate destroy this punishment will be everlaste permanent and final the Bible call it the second death Rev.20:14- 21:8 from which there be no possibility of a further resurrection the Bible do teach eternal punishment but not eternal punishing the prophet Malachi provide a graphic description for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn they up 4:1 to the righteous God say that the wicked shall be ashe under the sol of your foot mal.4:3 Gehenna be a place of destruction and death not a place of live torture Jesus be talk to Jews who understand all about this Gehenna or valley of Hinnom utter destruction by fire be complete nothing be leave but ashe every text in the Bible translate from this greek word Gehenna mean complete destruction not live torture not eternal life in torment the Bible say in Romans 6:23 the wage of sin be death not eternal life in torture the punishment reveal in the Bible be death the cessation of life;3

1292;in article   1993may12.193454.29823hal.com   bobphal.com Bob Pendleton write   from article   1993May7.235404.22590pony ingre COM   by mwmeyeringre COM Mike wade through the muck and Meyer    this be get pretty silly first off Hacker be an obsolete term    does n't matter what it use to mean today it mean thief       it only mean thief if you want it to mean that to I it mean   lot of context wickedly omit by myself       anyway if I say Joe be a hacker to most english speak people who   know the word they 'll probably think he be either a poor golfer or a   bad carpenter but there be very very few people who will think he be   a good and clever programmer     if you choose to call yourself by a term that mean thief do n't be   surprise when people think you be a thief even if you do n't agree   with that definition of the word        the narrow view that a hacker when associate with the computing environment be a dishon expert be not so widespread I 'm my opinion at least with the people involve with the field IMHO the wide meaning be not obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to be     therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody perceive you as a thief then this person belong to a very very small group that have some computer knowledge but not enough to know the wide and original meaning of the word     unfortunately the general public have a very narrow view of the deep dark recess of the art of computing what little they do see be from the view give to they by the medium from what I have see from the medium hacker be not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person I on the other hand know what hacker mean from those who consider themselves such follow be the definition from Jargon File 2.9.10 this be also know as the Hackers Dictionary the definition be arrange in order of decrease frequency of usage hacker   originally someone who make furniture with an axe   n. 1 a person who enjoy explore the detail of programmable system and how to stretch their capability as oppose to most user who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary 2 one who program enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoy programming rather than just theorize about programming 3 a person capable of appreciate   hack value   4 a person who be good at program quickly 5 an expert at a particular program or one who frequently do work use it or on it- as in a UNIX hacker definition 1 through 5 be correlate and people who fit they congregate 6 an expert or enthusiast of any kind one might be an astronomy hacker for example 7 one who enjoy the intellectual challenge of creatively overcome or circumvent limitation 8   deprecate   a malicious meddler who try to discover sensitive information by poke around hence password hacker network hacker see   cracker   the term hacker also tend to connote membership in the global community define by the net see   network the   and   internet address   it also imply that the person describe be see to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see   hacker ethic the   it be well to be describe as a hacker by other than to describe oneself that way hacker consider themselves something of an elite a meritocracy base on ability though one to which new member be gladly welcome there be thus a certain ego satisfaction to be have in identify yourself as a hacker but if you claim to be one and be not you 'll quickly be label   bogus   see also   wannabee   hacker ethic the n. 1 the belief that information sharing be a powerful positive good and that it be an ethical duty of hacker to share their expertise by write free software and facilitate access to information and to compute resource wherever possible 2 the belief that system crack for fun and exploration be ethically ok as long as the cracker commit no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality both of these normative ethical principle be widely but by no mean universally accept among hacker Most hacker subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1 and many act on it by writing and give away free software a few go far and assert that   all   information should be free and   any   proprietary control of it be bad- this be the philosophy behind the   GNU   project Sense 2 be more controversial some people consider the act of crack itself to be unethical like break and enter but this principle at least moderate the behavior of people who see themselves as   benign cracker see also   samurai   on this view it be one of the high form of hackerly courtesy to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop preferably by email from a   superuser   account exactly how it be do and how the hole can be plug act as an unpaid an unsolicited   tiger team   the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic be that almost all hacker be actively willing to share technical trick software and where possible compute resource with other hacker huge cooperative network such as   USENET     Fidonet   and Internet see   internet address   can function without central control because of this trait- they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom 's most valuable intangible asset finally a true hacker do not name himself   herself one for this be a title that be bestow by the befuddle sysadmin and user at large to I a sign of a truly great hacker be to be introduce to someone who say Nahh I just know a thing or two people always exagerate note that the above definition do not preclude a hacker from describe limself meaning himself   herself one but simply say that it be well not to do so there be many who do not know the meaning of hacker so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it be sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known respected hacker around the workplace this mean that hacker be define in term of some well know and respected person sometimes there may only be one such person   no matter what Mr. Dumpty say language does n't work that way actually it do you just have to get adequate press coverage language work anyway that we want it to work the purpose of language be to communicate to oversimplify as long as communication be take place then language be work;1

1311;I hate to belabor the obvious once again but if there have be an Orbiter emergency in the early stage of the original HST deployment mission they would have have to land with HST in the bay indeed they be worried about that one concern be the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up and make orbit but one that be too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag I believe the decision be to deploy HST even if the project lifetime be as short as six month in fact we get an excellent orbit on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do I have never hear of any serious consideration that HST might be bring down for refurbishment you would have the horrendous cost of transporting cleaning re testing and re certify all the hardware on the ground in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risk that we might not get such a good orbit the second time and you would probably still need a third servicing mission in a few year as gyros and other component wear out well to have two servicing mission in space which could well happen than to bring HST down and take it up again;2

1329;stuff delete I reiterate that I would agree with you that there be little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an in islamic history as well apostasy have rarely be punish Belief be consider a matter of conscience and since there be to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostate have be generally leave to believe or not believe as they will however when an apostate make attack upon God and his Messenger the situation change now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charge perhaps charge of sedition treason spying etc if the person make a public issue of their apostasy or mount public attack as oppose to arguement against Islam the situation be likewise complicated if the person spread slander or broadcast falsehood again the situation change the punishment vary accord to the situation the apostate be in anyhow the charge of aggravate apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie 's case there be a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and be in the situation where someone unilaterally wage war by their action create disorder make mischief etc against the Muslims and create a situation that result in harm to Muslims here a small group or even a single individual could be say to be engage in such a practise in other word there be a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly define party wage war conclude treaty exchange prisoner etc and deal with attack that come from isolated individual or group against Islam it be the second situation the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that would apply in the case of Rushdie the matter of Rushdie be not a simple matter of ban an offensive book ban the book be secondary a full set of circumstance follow the publication of the book come into play as well include the death of many Muslims and Rushdie 's and his publisher medium game I be not sure which hadith you be refer to above I believe that one of the qur'anic verse on which the fatwa be base be 5:33 every verse in the Qur'an have a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way be the understanding the tafsir of the verse restrict solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it be reveal if this be the case then we could say that all the law and regulation that be reveal when the Muslims be not involve in conflict should be suspend when they be at war the logic do not follow in complex real life situation there may be many verse and many hadith which can all be relate to a single complicated situation the internal relationship between these verse may be quite complex such that arrive at an understanding of how the verse interlock and how each apply to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task it be not necessarily a simple this or that process there may be many parameter involve there may be a large context in which a particular situation should be view all these matter impinge on the situation in other word there be a great deal involve in decipher the Qur'an the qur'an ask we to reflect on its verse but this reflection must entail more than simply read a verse and its corresponding hadith if the reflection be for the sake of increase personal piety then each person have his own level of understanding and there be no harm in that however if the reflection be in order to decide matter that pertain to the State to the gestation of law and ruling to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there be certain minimum requirement of understand that one should achieve Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as Sadiq(a.s relate some of these requirement as teach by the Prophet(S.A. in a hadith he who do not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous- and do not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and do not recognize a verse of meccan period from a Medinite one and do not know the circumstance of revelation and do not understand the technical word of the Qur'an whether simple or compound)- and do not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and be ignorant of advance and delay in its verses)- and do not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination- and be unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exception and the all inclusive and be ignorant of an adjective of a precede noun that explain the subsequent one- and be unaware of the emphasize subject and the detailed one the obligatory law and the permission the place of the duty and rule and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful- and do not know the joined word and the word that be relate to those come before they or after they then such a man do not know the Qur'an- nor be he among the people of the Qur'an base on these and other hadith and in accordance with many qur'anic verse why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn people when they return to they so that they may beware 9:122 a science of jurisprudence arise the requirement for a person to be consider a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matter of law and religion be many I 've list a few major division below there be of course many subdivision within these heading Knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation root semantic oratory Knowledge of tafsir and principle of tafsir Logic mantiq a knowledge of

abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogate the principle of application of the law involve principle of exemption principle of precaution principle of option principle of mastery the jurisprudent be bind to go through a very rigorous process in pronounce judgement on a give situation it be not a matter of look at one verse and one hadith now no one should blindly follow anyone but there be a difference between blind follow and accede to the opinion of someone who be clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself there be the the fuqaha religious scholar be the trustee of the Prophet as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desire pleasure and wealth of this world the Prophet S.A. be ask o Messenger of God how may we know if they so concern themselves he S.A. reply by see whether they follow the rule power if they do that fear for your religion and shun they I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhab to comment on how this hadith apply to they or to the contemporary scholar who base themselves upon they the Prophet also refer to the fuqaha as the fortress of Islam my only point be to make it clear that arrive at a legal judgement call into play a certain amount of expertise the specific of this expertise be delineate in the Qur'an and hadith those who acquire this expertise be praise in both the Qur'an and hadith those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matter that affect society state and religion be caution the only reason I say anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group be because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that be apostasy be wrong when one discuss something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly Khomeini be condemn as a heretic because he supposedly claim to be infallible another instance of create a straw man and then beat he I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup

1338;  in article   1r0sn03rhorus.ap.mchp.sni.de      theism be strongly correlate with irrational belief in absolute irrational    belief in absolute be strongly correlate with fanatism    deletion     Theism be correlate with fanaticism I have neither say that all fanatism    is cause by theism nor that all theism lead to fanatism the point be    theism increase the chance of become a fanatic one could of course    argue that would be fanatic tend towards theism for example but I just    have to loook at the time in history when theism be the dominant ideology    to invalidate that conclusion that that be the basic mechanism behind it      imo the influence of Stalin or for that matter Ayn Rand invalidate your    assumption that theism be the factor to be consider    Bogus I just say that theism be not the only factor for fanatism   the point be that theism be   a   factor That be your claim- now back it up I consider your argument as useful as the following Belief be strongly correlate with fanaticism therefore belief be   a   factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this be   any   belief not belief in Gods    Gullibility    blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on be all more    reliable indicator and the really dangerous people the source of    fanaticism be often none of these thing they be cynical manipulator    of the gullible who know precisely what they be do    That be a claim you have to support please note that especially in the   field of theism the leader believe what they say if you believe that you 're incredibly naive    now   some     brand of theism and more precisely   some   theist do tend to fanaticism    I grant you to tar all theist with this brush be bigotry not a reasoned    argument and it read to I like a warm up for censorship and restriction    of religious freedom ever read Animal Farm     That be a straw man and as usually in discussion with you one have to   repeat it read what I have write above not every theism lead to   fanatism and not all fanatism be cause by theism the point be   there be a correlation and it come from innate feature of theism no some of it come from feature which   some   theism have in common with   some   fanaticism your last statement simply is n't imply by what you say before because you 're try to sneak in innate feature of   all   theism the word you 're grope for be some   Gullibility by the way be one of they no shit Sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seem a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as oppose to the case you be try to make   and to say that I be go to forbid religion be another of your straw   man interesting that you have nothing well to offer I say it read like a warm up to that That 's because it 's an irrational and bogus tirade and have no other use than create a nice they   Us split in the mind of excitable people such as be to be find on either side of church wall    2 Define irrational belief e.g. be it rational to believe that      reason be always useful           irrational belief be belief that be not base upon reason the latter have    been discuss for a long time with Charley Wingate one point be that    the belief violate reason often and another that a process that do    not lend itself to rational analysis do not contain reliable information      well there be a glaring paradox here an argument that reason be useful    base on reason would be circular and argument not base on reason would    be irrational which be it     That 's bogus self reference be not circular and since the evaluation of   usefulness be possible within rational system it be allow O.K. it 's oval It 's still beg the question however and though that certainly be allow it 's not rational and you claim to be rational and all at the risk of repeat myself and hear we have that before   we did n't hear a   refutation   before so we 're back deal with it   you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason be useful someone who think reason be crap wo n't buy it you see   your argument be as silly as prove mathematical statement need mathematic   and mathematic be therfore circular anybody else think Godel be silly    the first part of the second statement contain no information because    you do n't say what the belief be if the belief be strong theism    andor strong atheism then your statement be not in general true the    second part of your sentence be patently false counterexample an    axiomatic datum do not lend itself to rational analysis but be    assume to contain reliable information regardless of what process be    use to obtain it      I 've be speak of religious system with contradictory definition   of god here    an axiomatic datum lend itself to rational analysis what you say here   be a an often refute fallacy have a look at the discussion of the   axiom of choice and far one can evaluate axiom in large system   out of which they be usually derive I exist be derive if you want   it that way    far one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axiom    what be it you be try to say that at some point people always wind up say this datum be reliable for no particular reason at all example I be not dream    Compared the evidence theist have for their claim to the strength of    their demand make the whole thing not only irrational but antirational      I ca n't agree with this until you be specific   which   theism to    say that all theism be necessarily antirational require a proof which    I suspect you do not have      use the traditonal definition of god personal supernatural entity   with objective effect on this world usually connect to moral andor   the way the world work imo any belief about such god be necessarily irrational that do not mean that people who hold they be in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence some atheist be also scientist for example    the affinity to fanatism be easily see it have to be true because I believe    it be nothing more than a work hypothesis however the belief say they be    more than a work hypothesis      I do n't understand this can you formalise your argument    Person A believe system b becuase it sound so nice that do not make   b true it be at good a work hypothesis however the content of B be that   it be true and that it be more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluate   evidence for or against it therefore dismiss because b already believe   say it be wronG a waste of time not possible depend on the further   content of B Amalekites   idolater   Protestants be to be kill this can   have interesting effect Peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief in god entail the further content of which you speak why are n't my catholic neighbour out kill the protestant for example maybe they do n't believe in it maybe it 's the conjunction of B assert b and jail   kill dissenter that be important and the belief in god be entirely irrelevant it certainly seem so to I but then I have no axe to grind here;0
